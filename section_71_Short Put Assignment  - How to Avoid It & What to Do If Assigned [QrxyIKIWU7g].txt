==================================================================================

Language: en all< all right already so in today's video all right already so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about shot put we're going to be talking about shot put assignment< assignment now if you have seen my other assignment now if you have seen my other videos< videos on cash check output right then videos on cash check output right then you< you don't really have this problem of you don't really have this problem of assignment< assignment because you already have the assignment because you already have the cash< cash to fulfill the obligation to buy a cash to fulfill the obligation to buy a hundred< hundred shares of the underlying stock hundred shares of the underlying stock that< that is why it's called a cash secure that is why it's called a cash secure put< put now but what if you're only using put now but what if you're only using the< the put option more specifically the the put option more specifically the short< short put strategy to just get in and short put strategy to just get in and out< out of the market right you just want to out of the market right you just want to use< use it as a speculation tool now in this use it as a speculation tool now in this case< case you do not want to be assigned so case you do not want to be assigned so what< what do you do how do you avoid getting what do you do how do you avoid getting assigned< assigned and what do you do if you are assigned and what do you do if you are assigned< assigned early assigned early so< so what happens when your shot put is so what happens when your shot put is assigned< assigned all right so as long as your assigned all right so as long as your shot< shot put is in the money right that's shot put is in the money right that's the< the only time when you can have a chance the only time when you can have a chance of< of getting a sign if it's out of the of getting a sign if it's out of the money< money there's no way you can get a sign money there's no way you can get a sign so< so if it's in the money there's always a so if it's in the money there's always a possibility< possibility of getting assigned early so possibility of getting assigned early so when< when you're assigned on your shot put when you're assigned on your shot put you< you will get long 100 shares per you will get long 100 shares per contract< contract so for example contract so for example let's< let's say you have sold a put option at let's say you have sold a put option at the< the 175 Mark so you can see that the the 175 Mark so you can see that the market< market is below here so this is in the market is below here so this is in the money< money anyway that is below the shot put money anyway that is below the shot put strike< strike price it is considered in the strike price it is considered in the money< money and there's always a possibility money and there's always a possibility of< of getting a sign so what happens when of getting a sign so what happens when you< you assign so when your shot put is you assign so when your shot put is assigned< assigned the broker will basically make assigned the broker will basically make you< you buy a hundred shares of the you buy a hundred shares of the underlying< underlying stock so you're obligated to underlying stock so you're obligated to buy< buy so you assign on this 100 shares buy so you assign on this 100 shares which< which means you need to have the capital which means you need to have the capital to< to buy this 100 shares so your broker to buy this 100 shares so your broker will< will take the cash that is needed to will take the cash that is needed to fund< fund this 100 shares from your account fund this 100 shares from your account so< so for example if this is uh the strike so for example if this is uh the strike of< of 175 that means if you get assigned on of 175 that means if you get assigned on this< this uh shares that means you need to this uh shares that means you need to put< put up 17 500 in terms of cash or the put up 17 500 in terms of cash or the margin< margin will be normally 50 of it now margin will be normally 50 of it now what< what happens if you don't have enough what happens if you don't have enough cash< cash if you don't have enough cash then cash if you don't have enough cash then this< this is where you will get a margin call this is where you will get a margin call right< right so this is very important to right so this is very important to understand< understand and what you need to do if understand and what you need to do if you< you get a margin call so if you have a you get a margin call so if you have a cover< cover call position previously I talked cover call position previously I talked about< about cover call assignment you don't about cover call assignment you don't have< have to worry about getting into a have to worry about getting into a margin< margin call because that will never margin call because that will never happen< happen because you have long 100 shares happen because you have long 100 shares and< and then by selling a cover call and then by selling a cover call basically< basically what the position is doing is basically what the position is doing is that< that if you get assigned your shares that if you get assigned your shares will< will just be taken away so now your 100 will just be taken away so now your 100 shares< shares will be Net Zero you have no shares will be Net Zero you have no position< position so there's no way for you to position so there's no way for you to get< get a margin call but for the shot put get a margin call but for the shot put it's< it's very different for the shot put you it's very different for the shot put you will< will buy the 100 shares of the will buy the 100 shares of the underlying< underlying stock if you get a sign so underlying stock if you get a sign so this< this is where you need to have the cash this is where you need to have the cash to< to get assigned on the 100 shares so to get assigned on the 100 shares so here< here are a number of short put here are a number of short put assignment< assignment questions that you might have assignment questions that you might have so< so let's say for example you get so let's say for example you get assigned< assigned and then you don't have enough assigned and then you don't have enough cash< cash you're gonna get a margin call so cash you're gonna get a margin call so what< what happens if you get a margin call what happens if you get a margin call and< and what do you do if you get a margin and what do you do if you get a margin call< call now what you do if you're assigned call now what you do if you're assigned on< on your shot put as well and how do you on your shot put as well and how do you avoid< avoid getting your shot put assigned so avoid getting your shot put assigned so these< these are the questions or rather the these are the questions or rather the most< most common questions that people have most common questions that people have when< when it comes to getting a sign on their when it comes to getting a sign on their shot< shot put so the very first thing you shot put so the very first thing you want< want to take note of is what you want to want to take note of is what you want to do< do if you get a margin call so first of do if you get a margin call so first of all< all don't panic all don't panic right< right a margin call is a very standard right a margin call is a very standard procedure< procedure it's not like you committed a procedure it's not like you committed a crime< crime what it just means is that you crime what it just means is that you need< need to top up your account so if you need to top up your account so if you get< get a margin call the broker will get a margin call the broker will contact< contact you to ask you to top up your contact you to ask you to top up your account account account and< and if you do not do anything your and if you do not do anything your broker< broker will basically just close out the broker will basically just close out the positions< positions in your account to meet the positions in your account to meet the margin< margin requirement right so if you have margin requirement right so if you have multiple< multiple positions on your broker will multiple positions on your broker will just< just close out the positions that they just close out the positions that they need< need to close out in order for you to need to close out in order for you to meet< meet their margin requirement right so meet their margin requirement right so some< some positions you might be holding on some positions you might be holding on in< in eventually that it becomes a profit in eventually that it becomes a profit well< well if you have a margin call your well if you have a margin call your broker< broker could just close that out all broker could just close that out all right< right so it's very important so what you right so it's very important so what you want< want to know is how long do you have to want to know is how long do you have to rectify< rectify the situation the moment they rectify the situation the moment they contact< contact you well according to finra contact you well according to finra which< which is the financial industry which is the financial industry regulatory< regulatory Authority regulatory Authority let< let me just change that there's let me just change that there's Authority Authority Authority right< right it says that you have roughly two right it says that you have roughly two to< to five days you have two to five days to five days you have two to five days in< in order to rectify the situation so in order to rectify the situation so many< many margin investors are familiar with many margin investors are familiar with the< the routine Margin Call where the broker the routine Margin Call where the broker asks< asks for additional funds when the asks for additional funds when the equity< equity in the customer's account equity in the customer's account declines< declines below certain required levels declines below certain required levels so< so normally the broker will allow from so normally the broker will allow from two< two to five days to meet the call so two to five days to meet the call so this< this is the time where you want to this is the time where you want to rectify< rectify your shot put situation or rectify your shot put situation or rather< rather the 100 shares that you're along rather the 100 shares that you're along so< so if you are assigned on the shot put so if you are assigned on the shot put you< you simply have to do these two actions you simply have to do these two actions right< right you just have to first sell out right you just have to first sell out the< the 100 shares and then you sell the put the 100 shares and then you sell the put option< option at the same strike but with a option at the same strike but with a longer< longer days to expiration you need to longer days to expiration you need to sell< sell off your 100 shares because now you sell off your 100 shares because now you are< are long 100 shares are long 100 shares so< so when you're along 100 shares what you so when you're along 100 shares what you need< need to do is you need to sell off this need to do is you need to sell off this one< one so now you become a net zero shares one so now you become a net zero shares position< position and then you sell one shot put position and then you sell one shot put all< all right so basically what you're doing all right so basically what you're doing is< is you're reinstating the position which is you're reinstating the position which you< you originally had which is the short you originally had which is the short put< put position now you want to sell it at put position now you want to sell it at the< the same strike price of course that is the same strike price of course that is the< the way to resume the position but this the way to resume the position but this time< time with a longer days to expression time with a longer days to expression now< now chances are that if you are assigned now chances are that if you are assigned on< on your shot put there must be most on your shot put there must be most likely< likely less than 30 days on your likely less than 30 days on your expiration< expiration right that's generally the expiration right that's generally the time< time where you will get assigned if if time where you will get assigned if if you< you do get assigned at all so you want you do get assigned at all so you want to< to choose a days to expression right the to choose a days to expression right the DT< DT to be longer than 30 days you want it DT to be longer than 30 days you want it to< to be more than 30 days and the reason to be more than 30 days and the reason is< is because when you have a expiration is because when you have a expiration date< date that is longer than 30 days there's date that is longer than 30 days there's going< going to be some extrinsic value left going to be some extrinsic value left extrinsic< extrinsic value is very important when extrinsic value is very important when it< it comes to knowing whether you're going it comes to knowing whether you're going to< to get assigned or not all right so this to get assigned or not all right so this is< is what I'm going to talk about in the is what I'm going to talk about in the next< next slide but for now what you need to next slide but for now what you need to understand< understand is that you want to reinstate understand is that you want to reinstate a< a position that is longer than 30 days a position that is longer than 30 days all< all right so this is all you need to do all right so this is all you need to do and< and you want to do this in a single and you want to do this in a single order< order ticket so this way you do not have order ticket so this way you do not have like< like a price a difference between your like a price a difference between your shot< shot put and the 300 shares so you can shot put and the 300 shares so you can do< do this in the think or stream platform do this in the think or stream platform all< all you have to do is to right click on all you have to do is to right click on the< the put side right the strike that you the put side right the strike that you want< want on the put option and then you just want on the put option and then you just click< click the covered stock position so what click the covered stock position so what it< it does you can see that it sells off it does you can see that it sells off the< the stock which you have the 100 shares the stock which you have the 100 shares and< and then you sell the one put option so and then you sell the one put option so the< the moment you do this the shares will the moment you do this the shares will be< be sold away so you relieve the margin be sold away so you relieve the margin the< the buying power needed right you the buying power needed right you relieve< relieve all the margin that I've used up relieve. all the margin that I've used up where< where you bought from the broker and where you bought from the broker and then< then you resume back this short put then you resume back this short put position< position again position again so< so that's simply it so when you sell so that's simply it so when you sell your< your shares and sell another put option your shares and sell another put option at< at the same strike You're simply at the same strike You're simply resuming< resuming your initial short position resuming your initial short position so< so one thing you want to understand is so one thing you want to understand is how< how to avoid this situation in future how to avoid this situation in future right< right so this is when you're in danger right so this is when you're in danger of< of early assignment so you're likely of of early assignment so you're likely of early< early assignment on your shot put when early assignment on your shot put when firstly< firstly your shot put is in the money firstly your shot put is in the money and< and the extrinsic value is very little and the extrinsic value is very little and< and there's very few days to expiration and there's very few days to expiration the< the key thing down here is the extrinsic the key thing down here is the extrinsic value< value so as long as there's still a value so as long as there's still a decent< decent amount of extrinsic value left in decent amount of extrinsic value left in the< the shot put you're unlikely to get the shot put you're unlikely to get assigned< assigned even though you're in the money assigned even though you're in the money now< now you may not realize this but now you may not realize this but actually< actually as early assignment is not as actually as early assignment is not as common< common as you think so common as you think so here's< here's what we're going to do right so here's what we're going to do right so we're< we're going to try and put ourselves we're going to try and put ourselves into< into the mindset of put buyers and then into the mindset of put buyers and then from< from there we're going to understand a from there we're going to understand a little< little bit whether we're going to get a little bit whether we're going to get a sign< sign and from the poop bias point of sign and from the poop bias point of view< view we're going to see whether we're view we're going to see whether we're actually< actually going to exercise this put actually going to exercise this put option< option so for example option so for example you< you sell a put option here so for you sell a put option here so for example< example you know 120 is the place where example you know 120 is the place where you< you think that the market will continue you think that the market will continue to< to go up right so just as an example to go up right so just as an example we're< we're going to sell a production 120 so we're going to sell a production 120 so you< you sold and all of the money put option you sold and all of the money put option for< for two dollars now let's flip the table for two dollars now let's flip the table around around around turn< turn the tables around and now let's see turn the tables around and now let's see things< things from the put bias perspective so things from the put bias perspective so you< you saw the put option so most likely you saw the put option so most likely you< you would have sold it to somebody who you would have sold it to somebody who wants< wants to buy a put option all right so wants to buy a put option all right so when< when they buy the put option they will when they buy the put option they will pay< pay two dollars for it all right so they pay two dollars for it all right so they pay< pay two dollars for all the money put pay two dollars for all the money put option< option at the same strike price so option at the same strike price so you're< you're the counterparty of this put you're the counterparty of this put option< option right so the poop bias is the option right so the poop bias is the counterparty< counterparty of the production that you counterparty of the production that you sold sold sold now< now why would they want to buy it what's now why would they want to buy it what's the< the reason why someone would want to buy the reason why someone would want to buy a< a put option a put option so< so there are two reasons number one is so there are two reasons number one is to< to speculate to the downside that means to speculate to the downside that means all< all they're doing is just buying the put all they're doing is just buying the put option< option and hopefully they want to sell option and hopefully they want to sell away< away the put option for a profit most of away the put option for a profit most of the< the time that's the case right the time that's the case right the< the other way is they want to protect the other way is they want to protect their< their long stock position so maybe they their long stock position so maybe they had< had a long stock position already maybe had a long stock position already maybe they< they bought somewhere down here all they bought somewhere down here all right< right let's just say that they bought right let's just say that they bought 100< 100 shares at this price so they're 100 shares at this price so they're afraid< afraid that the market will go down afraid that the market will go down right< right so if the market goes down at right so if the market goes down at least< least they have some protection which least they have some protection which means< means they have kept their maximum loss means they have kept their maximum loss to< to where the put option strike price is to where the put option strike price is so< so here let's play a little game of so here let's play a little game of would< would you exercise the put option if you would you exercise the put option if you are< are the put buyer all right so a lot of are the put buyer all right so a lot of people< people are afraid they get assigned so people are afraid they get assigned so in< in order for you to really understand in order for you to really understand whether< whether you will actually get a sign you whether you will actually get a sign you need< need to put yourself as the put buyer so need to put yourself as the put buyer so imagine< imagine that you are the one that imagine that you are the one that actually< actually buys this put option then I'm actually buys this put option then I'm going< going to give you a number of scenarios going to give you a number of scenarios and< and then from this scenarios I want you and then from this scenarios I want you to< to ask yourself whether you would to ask yourself whether you would actually< actually exercise the put option Okay so actually exercise the put option Okay so the< the first scenario so scenario number the first scenario so scenario number one< one you already bought a put option at one you already bought a put option at 120< 120 strike price you bought it for two 120 strike price you bought it for two dollars< dollars and now the stock has dropped to dollars and now the stock has dropped to a< a hundred and fifteen dollars so this is a hundred and fifteen dollars so this is actually< actually a very good scenario for you actually a very good scenario for you because< because now you're in profit with the because now you're in profit with the put< put option right because you bought a put option right because you bought a put< put option you actually want the market put option you actually want the market to< to go down so here are the details of to go down so here are the details of your< your put options so your put option is your put options so your put option is now< now worth six dollars right you bought now worth six dollars right you bought it< it for two dollars it's now worth six it for two dollars it's now worth six dollars< dollars and this put option comprises dollars and this put option comprises always< always of two values right if it's in always of two values right if it's in the< the money there's always intrinsic value the money there's always intrinsic value and< and extrinsic value so intrinsic value and extrinsic value so intrinsic value is< is five dollars basically it's just the is five dollars basically it's just the difference< difference from the strike price to difference from the strike price to where< where the current price is so because where the current price is so because there's< there's a five dollars difference the there's a five dollars difference the intrinsic< intrinsic value of your put option now intrinsic value of your put option now has< has five dollars it started off with has five dollars it started off with zero< zero dollars because it was out of the zero dollars because it was out of the money< money but then as it goes in the money money but then as it goes in the money you< you now start to pick up intrinsic value you now start to pick up intrinsic value but< but your extrinsic value right it's now but your extrinsic value right it's now only< only one dollar right so at this point only one dollar right so at this point of< of time ask yourself this question would of time ask yourself this question would you< you exercise your put option right you you exercise your put option right you are< are the put buyer would you if you are the put buyer would you if you exercise< exercise your put option it means that exercise your put option it means that you< you will now be short 100 shares at a you will now be short 100 shares at a hundred< hundred and twenty dollars hundred and twenty dollars so< so would you exercise your put option so would you exercise your put option and< and be short 100 shares at a hundred and and be short 100 shares at a hundred and twenty< twenty dollars twenty dollars well< well let's walk through this all right well let's walk through this all right let's< let's go through this very methodically let's go through this very methodically if< if you were to exercise your put option if you were to exercise your put option at< at a hundred and twenty dollars at a hundred and twenty dollars if< if you were to close your position to if you were to close your position to buy< buy it back at 115 what would be your buy it back at 115 what would be your profit< profit all right so if you exercise it profit all right so if you exercise it it< it means that you're now you're shot at it means that you're now you're shot at 120< 120 and then now the current price is 120 and then now the current price is 115< 115 and let's say that you can actually 115 and let's say that you can actually buy< buy back right now at uh at a spot at buy back right now at uh at a spot at 115< 115 total you make five dollars now this 115 total you make five dollars now this is< is a profit of course you made money but is a profit of course you made money but if< if you will take a look at the put if you will take a look at the put option< option if you actually sold the put option if you actually sold the put option< option you would be able to collect six option you would be able to collect six dollars< dollars so you bought for two dollars dollars so you bought for two dollars all< all right and then you sell for six all right and then you sell for six dollars< dollars so your profit would be four dollars so your profit would be four dollars dollars dollars but< but if you went ahead to exercise your but if you went ahead to exercise your put< put option that means you paid two put option that means you paid two dollars< dollars for it and then you sell it off dollars for it and then you sell it off and< and you receive five dollars your profit and you receive five dollars your profit would< would only be three dollars so would it would only be three dollars so would it actually< actually make any sense for you to want actually make any sense for you to want to< to exercise this put option to exercise this put option definitely< definitely not right because you could definitely not right because you could just< just simply sell the put option and then just simply sell the put option and then make< make much more money because you will make much more money because you will make< make this additional extrinsic value if make this additional extrinsic value if you< you had went ahead to exercise your put you had went ahead to exercise your put option< option it means that you have four goal option it means that you have four goal all< all the extrinsic value which you have all the extrinsic value which you have in< in this option so in this scenario it in this option so in this scenario it definitely< definitely does not make sense because definitely does not make sense because you< you still have extrinsic value in the you still have extrinsic value in the put< put option put option now< now let's flip the role again so let's now let's flip the role again so let's say< say you sew the put option if you sew say you sew the put option if you sew the< the put option right down here and now the put option right down here and now the< the market right the stock went below the market right the stock went below your< your strike price is in the money is your strike price is in the money is there< there any reason for you to panic that there any reason for you to panic that you< you might get assigned early you might get assigned early definitely< definitely not because you have a dollar definitely not because you have a dollar in< in extrinsic value left you see when in extrinsic value left you see when they< they put buyer he exercises the option they put buyer he exercises the option what< what he's doing is actually he's what he's doing is actually he's foregoing< foregoing his extrinsic value to give it foregoing his extrinsic value to give it to< to you so in this case you benefit even to you so in this case you benefit even though< though you're assigned early because though you're assigned early because when< when you're assigned early all you have when you're assigned early all you have to< to do is just do the two actions which I to do is just do the two actions which I mentioned< mentioned right all you have to do is mentioned right all you have to do is just< just sell away the shares and then you just sell away the shares and then you reinstate< reinstate your put option again at the reinstate your put option again at the same< same strike price by the way this video same strike price by the way this video has< has been helpful so far I'd appreciate has been helpful so far I'd appreciate if< if you hit the thumbs up button and also if you hit the thumbs up button and also subscribe< subscribe to my channel so I can create subscribe to my channel so I can create more< more videos like this for you in the more videos like this for you in the future< future okay back to the video alright so future okay back to the video alright so what< what about scenario number two now what about scenario number two now scenario< scenario number two is if the stock scenario number two is if the stock drops< drops all the way down even further to a drops all the way down even further to a hundred< hundred and ten dollars so would you hundred and ten dollars so would you exercise< exercise your put option so let's take a exercise your put option so let's take a look< look at the details now so the put look at the details now so the put option< option is now worth 10. 25 of which ten option is now worth 10.

25 of which ten dollars< dollars is intrinsic value that means dollars is intrinsic value that means that< that is the difference from 120 dollars that is the difference from 120 dollars to< to a hundred and ten dollars so that's to a hundred and ten dollars so that's ten< ten dollars difference and then you ten dollars difference and then you still< still have an extrinsic value of 25 still have an extrinsic value of 25 cents< cents now on one put option that is 25 cents now on one put option that is 25 so< so are you going to exercise your put so are you going to exercise your put option< option so again what happens if you option so again what happens if you exercise< exercise if you exercise you're going to exercise if you exercise you're going to be< be short be short 100< 100 shares 100 shares at< at 120 at 120 and< and then the current market price is 110 and then the current market price is 110 so< so if you were to close it straight away so if you were to close it straight away right< right you will make ten dollars but what right you will make ten dollars but what if< if you sell the put option instead if if you sell the put option instead if you< you sell the put option instead it would you sell the put option instead it would be< be 10 and 25 cents so now it becomes a be 10 and 25 cents so now it becomes a question< question do you want this 25 cents or question do you want this 25 cents or not< not right so most likely you would want not right so most likely you would want right< right that is still money right that's right that is still money right that's 25 25 25 now< now you might be saying that you know I now you might be saying that you know I want< want to exercise my option so that I can want to exercise my option so that I can hold< hold on to this 100 shares so that as hold on to this 100 shares so that as the< the market continues to drop I can still the market continues to drop I can still make< make money on it right if you're make money on it right if you're thinking< thinking of that then there's no thinking of that then there's no difference< difference if you still held on to your difference if you still held on to your put< put option because if you still head on put option because if you still head on to< to this put option as the market drops to this put option as the market drops do< do not forget that your intrinsic value do not forget that your intrinsic value actually< actually also increases together with actually also increases together with the< the stock dropping right so if the stock the stock dropping right so if the stock drops< drops all the way to 100 dollars then drops all the way to 100 dollars then you< you will still be making twenty dollars you will still be making twenty dollars in< in terms of intrinsic value if you want in terms of intrinsic value if you want to< to exercise this put option with the to exercise this put option with the shares< shares you will still have 20 of shares you will still have 20 of intrinsic< intrinsic value as well the only bonus intrinsic value as well the only bonus with< with the put option is that you could with the put option is that you could still< still have some extrinsic value even still have some extrinsic value even though< though it went all the way down here though it went all the way down here right< right so at this point of time there right so at this point of time there really< really is no reason for you to want to really is no reason for you to want to exercise< exercise your put option as the put exercise your put option as the put buyer< buyer now you might be asking what if buyer now you might be asking what if you< you are there you know you got this put you are there you know you got this put option< option just to protect your long stock option just to protect your long stock position< position so you have 100 shares let's position so you have 100 shares let's say< say maybe you bought at 125 dollars say maybe you bought at 125 dollars right< right so you got a 100 shares down here right so you got a 100 shares down here so< so at this point of time let's say it so at this point of time let's say it drops< drops to a hundred and ten dollars would drops to a hundred and ten dollars would you< you want to exercise this option and you want to exercise this option and then< then you just take the loss at 120 then you just take the loss at 120 dollars< dollars would this make sense to you so dollars would this make sense to you so if< if it was me I definitely not want to if it was me I definitely not want to exercise< exercise because firstly I've already exercise because firstly I've already got< got this position on right and I've got this position on right and I've already< already locked in the maximum loss that already locked in the maximum loss that I< I can lose at 102 20 so it doesn't I can lose at 102 20 so it doesn't matter< matter if it goes to 110 or it goes all matter if it goes to 110 or it goes all the< the way down to you know zero dollars it the way down to you know zero dollars it doesn't< doesn't matter because I've already got doesn't matter because I've already got this< this put option down here that has this put option down here that has already< already secured the maximum loss for me already secured the maximum loss for me and< and I can exercise this anytime I want and I can exercise this anytime I want before< before expression so if there's still before expression so if there's still some< some time left before the option expires some time left before the option expires maybe< maybe there's still like 30 days left if maybe there's still like 30 days left if there's< there's 30 days left the expiration why there's 30 days left the expiration why would< would I want to exercise the put option would I want to exercise the put option now< now when I can exercise it another time now when I can exercise it another time right< right I can exercise it any other time right I can exercise it any other time what< what I'd rather do is I'll wait to see what I'd rather do is I'll wait to see whether< whether the stock actually goes back up whether the stock actually goes back up because< because ultimately what I want is for because ultimately what I want is for the< the stock to go up because I have a long the stock to go up because I have a long 100< 100 shares position that's what I want 100 shares position that's what I want to< to see I want to see that the stock to see I want to see that the stock actually< actually goes up so why would I want to actually goes up so why would I want to cut< cut it off right now and then in the cut it off right now and then in the event< event where the market actually rallies event where the market actually rallies back< back up in the next 30 days I'm gonna back up in the next 30 days I'm gonna regret< regret right so I rather just keep this regret right so I rather just keep this on< on as an insurance I'll keep this on as on as an insurance I'll keep this on as an< an insurance until in fact the very last an insurance until in fact the very last day< day where I see that there's no chance day where I see that there's no chance for< for the market to go up for the market to go up then< then I'm just going to exercise it so then I'm just going to exercise it so that's< that's the only time I will want to that's the only time I will want to exercise< exercise if I have a long stop position exercise if I have a long stop position so< so in both cases there is. no reason for so in both cases there is no reason for me< me to exercise this put option when the me to exercise this put option when the stock< stock drops to 110 and there's still stock drops to 110 and there's still some< some extrinsic value left some extrinsic value left now< now let's take a look at the next now let's take a look at the next scenario< scenario now the next scenario scenario now the next scenario serial< serial number three is that the stock serial number three is that the stock drops< drops all the way to a hundred and five drops all the way to a hundred and five dollars< dollars and there's still 30 days to go dollars and there's still 30 days to go in< in expiration all right so the put in expiration all right so the put option< option is now worth fifteen dollars and option is now worth fifteen dollars and five< five cents of which 15 is intrinsic five cents of which 15 is intrinsic value< value and 5 cents is extrinsic value now value and 5 cents is extrinsic value now would< would you exercise your put option so would you exercise your put option so take< take a moment to think about this you take a moment to think about this you can< can pause the video can pause the video all< all right so if you have really thought all right so if you have really thought hard< hard and thought long about this you'll hard and thought long about this you'll realize< realize that there may not actually be a realize that there may not actually be a reason< reason for you to exercise the put reason for you to exercise the put option< option because there's still quite a bit option because there's still quite a bit of< of time left there's still 30 days to of time left there's still 30 days to expiration< expiration right and if I was to expiration right and if I was to exercise< exercise my put option right now what am exercise my put option right now what am I< I going to do with this 100 shares right I going to do with this 100 shares right am< am I going to close it out immediately am I going to close it out immediately at< at 105 and as we have seen in the at 105 and as we have seen in the previous< previous examples uh the previous previous examples uh the previous scenarios< scenarios if you were to close out scenarios if you were to close out immediately< immediately it makes no difference than immediately it makes no difference than if< if you were to just sell off the put if you were to just sell off the put option< option because the put option already option because the put option already had< had the embedded intrinsic value from had the embedded intrinsic value from this< this point all the way to here and with this point all the way to here and with the< the put option you still have the added the put option you still have the added benefit< benefit of this extrinsic value so in benefit of this extrinsic value so in this< this case you at least still get five this case you at least still get five dollars< dollars now the key thing is that dollars now the key thing is that there's< there's 30 days to expiration left so there's 30 days to expiration left so there< there really is no hurry for you to there really is no hurry for you to exercise< exercise this put option because exercise this put option because remember< remember when you are exercising a put remember when you are exercising a put option< option what you're doing is you are option what you're doing is you are foregoing< foregoing the right of this extrinsic foregoing the right of this extrinsic value< value all right so as long as there's value all right so as long as there's still< still extrinsic value for you it will be still extrinsic value for you it will be better< better off for you to just sell off the better off for you to just sell off the put< put option if you want to capture the put option if you want to capture the profits< profits at no time during this time down profits at no time during this time down here< here that you would want to actually here that you would want to actually exercise< exercise this put option so it goes the exercise this put option so it goes the same< same whether you're speculating or if same whether you're speculating or if you< you are protecting your long stock you are protecting your long stock position< position on this stock right so you have position on this stock right so you have 30< 30 days to go if you still have a long 30 days to go if you still have a long stock< stock position again you will just wait stock position again you will just wait right< right to see if the market actually right to see if the market actually bounce< bounce back because at the end of the bounce back because at the end of the day< day you're not trying to profit from the day you're not trying to profit from the put< put option if you are using it as an put option if you are using it as an insurance< insurance you're using it as protection insurance you're using it as protection if< if you're using it as protection all if you're using it as protection all you're< you're doing is just waiting to see that you're doing is just waiting to see that whether< whether the stock will actually bounce whether the stock will actually bounce back< back up back up before< before this uh option expires right and before this uh option expires right and if< if the option is going to expire on the if the option is going to expire on the day< day itself let's say it's the last day day itself let's say it's the last day left< left and you see that it's below your left and you see that it's below your strike< strike price then of course you go ahead strike price then of course you go ahead to< to go and exercise it to cut the maximum to go and exercise it to cut the maximum loss< loss that you have right at this strike loss that you have right at this strike price< price and where you went long 100 shares price and where you went long 100 shares all< all right so let's take a look at the all right so let's take a look at the last< last scenario so scenario number four last scenario so scenario number four same< same thing the stock drops to a hundred same thing the stock drops to a hundred and< and five dollars so same as scenario and five dollars so same as scenario number< number three but the difference is that number three but the difference is that there< there is seven days to expiration left there is seven days to expiration left so< so there's only seven days and now the so there's only seven days and now the put< put option is worth five dollars and one put option is worth five dollars and one cent< cent all right so this is a typo so it's cent all right so this is a typo so it's five< five dollars and one cents the intrinsic five dollars and one cents the intrinsic value< value is 15 and there's one cent left in value is 15 and there's one cent left in extrinsic< extrinsic value so now here comes the extrinsic value so now here comes the question< question so let's say for example you're question so let's say for example you're just< just speculating to the downside right just speculating to the downside right you< you do not have any long shares does it you do not have any long shares does it make< make sense for you to now exercise your make sense for you to now exercise your put< put option and now become short 100 put option and now become short 100 shares shares shares well< well the answer is it can be because you well the answer is it can be because you see< see you might want to still hold on to see you might want to still hold on to this< this position right so for example you this position right so for example you say< say that you want to shot 100 shares and say that you want to shot 100 shares and your< your target is actually not 105. your your target is actually not 105.

your target< target might be 100 maybe you want to target might be 100 maybe you want to take< take your profits at a hundred dollars take your profits at a hundred dollars but< but because there's only seven days left but because there's only seven days left in< in this uh good option you might just in this uh good option you might just want< want to go ahead and exercise it and I want to go ahead and exercise it and I just< just hold on to the short 100 shares just hold on to the short 100 shares until< until it reaches a hundred dollars right until it reaches a hundred dollars right you< you don't want to wait to see the next you don't want to wait to see the next seven< seven days to see whether it's going to seven days to see whether it's going to reach< reach the hundred dollars so at this reach the hundred dollars so at this point< point of time yes there is a reason for point of time yes there is a reason for you< you to exercise the put option also you to exercise the put option also because< because there isn't much extrinsic value because there isn't much extrinsic value left< left because there's no real incentive left because there's no real incentive left< left for you to just sell the put option left for you to just sell the put option because< because you're only going to get an because you're only going to get an additional< additional one dollar right even after additional one dollar right even after commission< commission this one dollar is going to commission this one dollar is going to be< be gone so you rather get assigned be gone so you rather get assigned because< because you plan to continue holding it because you plan to continue holding it all< all the way it goes down further so in all the way it goes down further so in this< this case then you would want to this case then you would want to exercise< exercise your put option now think about exercise your put option now think about this< this as the buyer of the option why are this as the buyer of the option why are you< you now suddenly you now suddenly wanting< wanting to exercise the option when the wanting to exercise the option when the previous< previous three scenarios you have not previous three scenarios you have not wanted< wanted to exercise your put option wanted to exercise your put option what's< what's the reason now if you go through what's the reason now if you go through this< this thought process you'll realize it's this thought process you'll realize it's because< because you saw that there's not much because you saw that there's not much time< time left you saw that there's only time left you saw that there's only seven< seven days to expiration and there's seven days to expiration and there's only< only one cent in extrinsic value that is only one cent in extrinsic value that is why< why you're considering to actually why you're considering to actually exercise< exercise the put option exercise the put option so< so now if you flip the stereo around so now if you flip the stereo around when< when you are the put seller so now you when you are the put seller so now you still< still now you have the shot put position still now you have the shot put position now< now you will realize that if you are the now you will realize that if you are the put< put option buyer this is the time when put option buyer this is the time when you< you want to exercise your put option you want to exercise your put option where< where you have very little days to where you have very little days to expiration< expiration left expiration left so< so this is the only time as the put so this is the only time as the put buyer< buyer that you are only thinking of buyer that you are only thinking of exercising< exercising so that means that if there exercising so that means that if there is< is a lot of DTE left and there's still a is a lot of DTE left and there's still a lot< lot of extrinsic value left then you're lot of extrinsic value left then you're not< not likely going to exercise this not likely going to exercise this production< production so now that you know what production so now that you know what goes< goes through the mind of a put buyer and goes through the mind of a put buyer and when< when they would actually likely exercise when they would actually likely exercise their< their put option how do you avoid early their put option how do you avoid early assignment< assignment so there are two methods assignment so there are two methods right< right the first method is a defensive right the first method is a defensive method< method that means you do not want to let method that means you do not want to let your< your shot put get in the money so if you your shot put get in the money so if you don't< don't want to let your shot put get in don't want to let your shot put get in the< the money that's when you will roll out the money that's when you will roll out and< and down once the underlying stock and down once the underlying stock reaches< reaches your strike price so for example reaches your strike price so for example this< this is the stock price right now and this is the stock price right now and you< you may have sold a shot put down here you may have sold a shot put down here so< so you sold one put option at this price so you sold one put option at this price and< and at this point of time as the market and at this point of time as the market gets< gets closer to your strike price this is gets closer to your strike price this is where< where you want to roll you want to roll where you want to roll you want to roll out< out to a further expiration date and you out to a further expiration date and you want< want to roll down as well as far as you want to roll down as well as far as you can< can get so at this point of time if you can get so at this point of time if you were< were to roll it down you may or may not were to roll it down you may or may not get< get a credit on this role depending on get a credit on this role depending on how< how far down you want to roll it but how far down you want to roll it but basically< basically when you do it this way basically when you do it this way there's< there's absolutely no chance for you to there's absolutely no chance for you to get< get assigned because the only time you get assigned because the only time you will< will get assigned is if the put is in will get assigned is if the put is in the< the money so if you never let it get in the money so if you never let it get in the< the money then there's no chance of an the money then there's no chance of an early< early assignment so if you want to know early assignment so if you want to know how< how to actually roll it I've already how to actually roll it I've already created< created a video it's called the shot put created a video it's called the shot put rolling< rolling masterclass you can go ahead and rolling masterclass you can go ahead and watch< watch that I put the link in the top watch that I put the link in the top right< right hand corner of this video right hand corner of this video now< now the next is what I call the now the next is what I call the extrinsic< extrinsic value preservation method now extrinsic value preservation method now the< the difference between this method and. the difference between this method and this< this method is that with the defensive this method is that with the defensive method< method you could find yourself rolling method you could find yourself rolling to< to very far out in time right because to very far out in time right because you< you do not want it to get in the money you do not want it to get in the money at< at all so you could find that maybe you at all so you could find that maybe you sold< sold this when there's 45 days to sold this when there's 45 days to expiration< expiration but then in 10 days let's say expiration but then in 10 days let's say in< in 10 days it starts to touch your in 10 days it starts to touch your strike< strike price so that means you actually strike price so that means you actually have< have 35 days left but because you want have 35 days left but because you want to< to use this defensive method you want to to use this defensive method you want to roll< roll out and down that means you have to roll out and down that means you have to roll< roll to a further expiration date so now roll to a further expiration date so now that< that you're at 35 you may have to roll that you're at 35 you may have to roll out< out to maybe at 60 days right let's say out to maybe at 60 days right let's say for< for example you wrote the 60 days for example you wrote the 60 days and< and then within another 10 days it and then within another 10 days it touches< touches your strike again then you will touches your strike again then you will have< have to roll out to an even further have to roll out to an even further expiration< expiration date so with this method expiration date so with this method while< while there's zero chance for you to get while there's zero chance for you to get assigned< assigned the thing is that you may end assigned the thing is that you may end up< up with a put option that has a an up with a put option that has a an expression< expression that is very far out right it expression that is very far out right it could< could go to 90 180 even a few hundred could go to 90 180 even a few hundred days< days so that is the downside of having days so that is the downside of having this< this defensive method now with this this defensive method now with this extrinsic< extrinsic value preservation method you extrinsic value preservation method you only< only roll out or roll out and down when only roll out or roll out and down when there's< there's roughly 21 to 30 days to there's roughly 21 to 30 days to expiration< expiration so let me just remove all expiration so let me just remove all this< this drawing down here right so for this drawing down here right so for example example example you< you may have sold the uh put option down you may have sold the uh put option down here< here and let's say there's 45 days left here and let's say there's 45 days left to< to go to go so< so during this point in time the market so during this point in time the market may< may have just gone you know all the way may have just gone you know all the way up< up and maybe have gone down go up again up and maybe have gone down go up again and< and then come down so during all this and then come down so during all this time< time you do nothing until there's time you do nothing until there's roughly< roughly 21 to 30 days left so let's say roughly 21 to 30 days left so let's say you< you use 21 DTE so let's say at 21 DT you you use 21 DTE so let's say at 21 DT you see< see that it is now in the money so now see that it is now in the money so now that< that it's in the money it's time to roll that it's in the money it's time to roll because< because remember because remember as< as we gone through the previous as we gone through the previous scenarios< scenarios the time when the option buyer scenarios the time when the option buyer the< the put buyer will consider exercising the put buyer will consider exercising their< their put option is only when there's their put option is only when there's very< very little days to expression left and very little days to expression left and when< when there's very little extrinsic value when there's very little extrinsic value left< left and there's very little extrinsic left and there's very little extrinsic value< value left when the option is actually value left when the option is actually deep< deep in the money all right and there's deep in the money all right and there's very< very little taste of expiration left so very little taste of expiration left so you< you want to make sure that this does not you want to make sure that this does not happen< happen with your put option position so happen with your put option position so that< that is why you want to roll it when that is why you want to roll it when it's< it's roughly 21 to 30 days so when it's it's roughly 21 to 30 days so when it's roughly< roughly 21 to 30 days if it's in the roughly 21 to 30 days if it's in the money< money you want to see how you can roll money you want to see how you can roll it< it so if it's just slightly in the money it so if it's just slightly in the money you< you can actually roll out and down right you can actually roll out and down right you< you could roll out to a further dates to you could roll out to a further dates to expiration expiration expiration ideally< ideally you can roll it back to a 45 ideally you can roll it back to a 45 days< days and then you roll it somewhere here days and then you roll it somewhere here right< right it may be still in the money but right it may be still in the money but that's< that's fine because you know from the that's fine because you know from the previous< previous scenarios even though it's in previous scenarios even though it's in the< the money there's still some time left the money there's still some time left in< in this option there's still extrinsic in this option there's still extrinsic value< value left it is very low chance that value left it is very low chance that you< you will get a sign but if you cannot you will get a sign but if you cannot roll< roll it down then what you can do is roll it down then what you can do is just< just simply just roll back to the same just simply just roll back to the same strike< strike price and then get a little bit strike price and then get a little bit of< of extrinsic value right so at this of extrinsic value right so at this point< point of time I have some options that point of time I have some options that I'm< I'm still rolling at the same strike I'm still rolling at the same strike price< price and each uh time when I roll I price and each uh time when I roll I cannot< cannot roll out and down I only can roll cannot roll out and down I only can roll out< out but the good thing is that whenever out but the good thing is that whenever I< I roll out I still can get some I roll out I still can get some extrinsic< extrinsic value which reduces the cost extrinsic value which reduces the cost basis< basis of this uh shot put option which I basis of this uh shot put option which I put< put on so if the Delta is less than 0. 8 put on so if the Delta is less than 0.

8 you< you can roll it around 21 DTE that means you can roll it around 21 DTE that means the< the price the stock price has not gone the price the stock price has not gone really< really that deep in the money yet so at really that deep in the money yet so at this< this point of time there is a chance for this point. of time there is a chance for you< you to still roll out and down depending you to still roll out and down depending on< on how far out you go if you cannot you on how far out you go if you cannot you can< can roll out now what if your Delta is can roll out now what if your Delta is more< more than 0. 8 well if it's more than 0.

8 more than 0. 8 well if it's more than 0.

8 then< then this is time where you might want then this is time where you might want to< to roll it at roughly around 30 days to to roll it at roughly around 30 days to expiration< expiration and the reason is because I expiration and the reason is because I had< had experience where I've had a number had experience where I've had a number of< of put options of put options on< on individual stocks right individual on individual stocks right individual stocks< stocks have a higher likelier chance. of stocks have a higher likelier chance of you< you getting a sign compared to index you getting a sign compared to index ETFs< ETFs so I have a number of put options ETFs so I have a number of put options short< short put options where it's roughly short put options where it's roughly around< around 27 DTE but there's very little around 27 DTE but there's very little extrinsic< extrinsic value left and that's you know extrinsic value left and that's you know I< I think my Delta is around 0. 9 or more I think my Delta is around 0.

9 or more and< and then I got exercise right I got and then I got exercise right I got exercise< exercise when there's still 27 days to exercise when there's still 27 days to expiration<. expiration so that is why for individual expiration so that is why for individual stocks< stocks and if you have a Delta of more stocks and if you have a Delta of more than< than 0. 8 I suggest that you will roll it than 0.

8 I suggest that you will roll it out< out once there's 30 days to expiration out once there's 30 days to expiration there< there right from 30 you can roll it out there right from 30 you can roll it out to< to the next expiration cycle normally to the next expiration cycle normally it's< it's roughly around 60 days so when it's it's roughly around 60 days so when it's 60< 60 days out there's very little chance 60 days out there's very little chance for< for you to get assigned as you have seen for you to get assigned as you have seen earlier< earlier on earlier on so< so if you have an index ETF then 21 days so if you have an index ETF then 21 days to< to expiration is fine but basically this to expiration is fine but basically this is< is the general rule so this is how you is the general rule so this is how you can< can avoid early assignment there's two can avoid early assignment there's two methods< methods there's no one that is better methods there's no one that is better than< than the other. it just comes down to you than the other it just comes down to you which< which you feel more comfortable with for which you feel more comfortable with for me< me I do not mind if the stock or rather me I do not mind if the stock or rather my< my shot put actually goes in the money my shot put actually goes in the money so< so I always choose for the extrinsic so I always choose for the extrinsic value< value preservation method all right guys value preservation method all right guys so< so that's it for this video I hope this so that's it for this video I hope this video< video has been helpful to you and if it video has been helpful to you and if it has< has I'd appreciate if you give me a has I'd appreciate if you give me a thumbs< thumbs up and also subscribe to my thumbs up and also subscribe to my channel< channel as well and as always thank you channel as well and as always thank you for< for watching I appreciate your time and for watching I appreciate your time and may<

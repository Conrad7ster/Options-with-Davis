### Long-Term Profitability Using LEAPS Options-IOjmMyFyoDs
===========================================================

Language: en alright< alright alrighty so today's video we're alright alrighty so today's video we're going< going to be talking about rolling leaps going to be talking about rolling leaps options< options for long-term profitability now options for long-term profitability now if< if you haven't watched my other videos if you haven't watched my other videos on< on leaves options uh more specifically on leaves options uh more specifically on< on using leaps options as a stock on using leaps options as a stock replacement< replacement strategy and how to enter replacement strategy and how to enter them< them as a trade then go ahead and watch them as a trade then go ahead and watch that< that video first i've put a link right that video first i've put a link right at< at the top right hand corner of this at the top right hand corner of this video< video so you can watch it but in this video so you can watch it but in this video< video we're going to be continuing the video we're going to be continuing the topic< topic of leaps right more specifically topic of leaps right more specifically we're< we're going to talk about rolling leaves we're going to talk about rolling leaves options options options why< why you want to roll it how you're going why you want to roll it how you're going to< to roll it and when you're going to roll to roll it and. when you're going to roll it< it all right so it all right so first< first thing what we want to first first thing what we want to first have< have an assumption is that we're only have an assumption is that we're only going< going to be talking about deep in the going to be talking about deep in the money< money call leaps as a stock replacement money call leaps as a stock replacement strategy< strategy right so we're not going to be strategy right so we're not going to be talking< talking about uh put leaps where you use talking about uh put leaps where you use them< them as an insurance in case the market them as an insurance in case the market crashes< crashes right for this video we're going crashes right for this video we're going to< to be talking about rolling coil leaves to be talking about rolling coil leaves as< as a form of continuing a long-term as a form of continuing a long-term investment< investment into the stock or etf uh that investment into the stock or etf uh that you< you want to invest in right so for this you want to invest in right so for this what< what we're going to be talking about is what we're going to be talking about is where< where we have a deep demanding call where we have a deep demanding call leaps< leaps with a delta of more than 0. 80 leaps with a delta of more than 0.

80 and< and days to expiration of more than and days to expiration of more than 365< 365 days 365 days now< now why do you want to roll it right why now why do you want to roll it right why do< do you want to roll in the first place do you want to roll in the first place when< when you can just close the did the when you can just close the did the money< money call leaps right yes you can of money call leaps right yes you can of course< course just go ahead and close it course just go ahead and close it but< but what if you are still bullish on a but what if you are still bullish on a long< long term view and you are currently long term view and you are currently still< still in a loss for your lips right so still in a loss for your lips right so when< when you're rolling it basically what when you're rolling it basically what you< you can do by rolling is to extend the you can do by rolling is to extend the life< life of your lips when you extend the life of your lips when you extend the life< life of your lips you actually also life of your lips you actually also continue< continue your long-term bullish view on continue your long-term bullish view on the< the underlying stock right if you still the underlying stock right if you still feel< feel that the market is going to go up feel that the market is going to go up in< in the long term especially if you are in the long term especially if you are buying< buying a deep in the money called leaps buying a deep in the money called leaps in< in etfs such as iwm qqq spiders where in etfs such as iwm qqq spiders where they< they will go up in the long term then they will go up in the long term then you< you definitely do want to roll it you definitely do want to roll it because< because when you roll it you actually because when you roll it you actually increase< increase your chance of profitability increase your chance of profitability right< right if you close it out right now and right if you close it out right now and then< then you don't re-enter into a trade then you don't re-enter into a trade then< then if you're in a loss you're just then if you're in a loss you're just going< going to take a loss right but if you going to take a loss right but if you roll< roll it you can still continue the life roll it you can still continue the life of< of this position of this position as< as though you would if you were holding as though you would if you were holding on< on to stocks on to stocks right< right so when do you want to roll it so right so when do you want to roll it so you< you want to roll it if you are still you want to roll it if you are still bullish< bullish on the underlying stock bullish on the underlying stock regardless< regardless if it's in a profit or loss regardless if it's in a profit or loss now< now this is very important to understand now this is very important to understand because< because if you are no longer bullish on because if you are no longer bullish on the< the underlying stock then it's better to the underlying stock then it's better to just< just close the option altogether right just close the option altogether right if< if you are hoping that the market will if you are hoping that the market will somehow< somehow go back up again somehow go back up again and< and you just want to keep rolling it and you just want to. keep rolling it then< then it may actually end up in a bigger then it may actually end up in a bigger loss< loss for you because each time when you loss for you because each time when you roll< roll if you are in a loss and each time roll if you are in a loss and each time you< you roll it you're actually adding more you roll it you're actually adding more to< to your initial risk right when you're to your initial risk right when you're prolonging< prolonging life you always have to pay prolonging life you always have to pay more< more extrinsic value so you only want to more extrinsic value so you only want to roll< roll it if you're still bullish on the roll it if you're still bullish on the underlying< underlying stock so in many of my cases underlying stock so in many of my cases most< most of the leaps which i have is on the most of the leaps which i have is on the index< index etfs so i have no worries just index etfs so i have no worries just extending< extending the life of it just rolling it extending the life of it just rolling it because< because i know in the long term the because i know in the long term the market< market will always want to go up right market will always want to go up right so< so the next thing is when do you want to so the next thing is when do you want to roll< roll it roll it right< right i generally want to roll it when right i generally want to roll it when there's< there's less than 90 days left to there's less than 90 days left to expiration< expiration most of the time when i buy expiration most of the time when i buy the< the lips right it will be around four to the lips right it will be around four to five< five hundred days to expiration so i'll five hundred days to expiration so i'll be< be holding it for quite a long time so be holding it for quite a long time so when< when it left roughly less than 90 days when it left roughly less than 90 days that's< that's when the theta will really start that's when the theta will really start to< to pick up right so this is the time to pick up right so this is the time when< when instead of letting the remaining when instead of letting the remaining extrinsic< extrinsic value decay i rather just roll extrinsic value decay i rather just roll it< it out to the furthest it out to the furthest base< base to expiration available so that i base to expiration available so that i can< can prolong it and keep the theta decay can prolong it and keep the theta decay low< low as well low as well so< so how do you want to roll it right so so how do you want to roll it right so there< there are two cases in which you want to there are two cases in which you want to roll< roll it so first is if you are in a roll it so first is if you are in a profit< profit right so if you're in a profit profit right so if you're in a profit you< you will basically just roll out and up you will basically just roll out and up to< to take some profit and re-establish the to take some profit and re-establish the initial< initial delta so chances are let's say initial delta so chances are let's say if< if we enter into the leaves at the start if we enter into the leaves at the start your< your delta will be roughly maybe your delta will be roughly maybe somewhere< somewhere around let's say let's take somewhere around let's say let's take 0. 90< 0.

90 right so you'll be doing the you'll 0. 90 right so you'll be doing the you'll be< be buying ellipse at 0.

90 and as the be buying ellipse at 0. 90 and as the market< market goes up market goes up your< your delta will also increase as well your delta will also increase as well because< because delta increases as because delta increases as the< the underlying stock moves up or down the underlying stock moves up or down right< right so right so in< in this case. if the market is to keep in this case if the market is to keep going< going up then your delta would go up as going up then your delta would go up as well< well it will keep going up all the way well it will keep going up all the way eventually< eventually it reaches close to 1.

00 very eventually it reaches close to 1. 00 very close< close so in this case if the market has close so in this case if the market has gone< gone up since when you bought the gone up since when you bought the leaps<. leaps option then your delta will pretty leaps option then your delta will pretty much< much increase as well so it may increase much increase as well so it may increase all< all the way to maybe 0.

98 at this point all the way to maybe 0. 98 at this point let's< let's say if the market has really shot let's say if the market has really shot up< up a lot so at this point of time when up a lot so at this point. of time when you< you roll it what you're doing is that you roll it what you're doing is that you< you are selling away this option you are selling away this option that< that has gone to 0.

98 that has gone to 0. 98 and< and then you are buying again to and then you are buying again. to re-establish< re-establish the initial delta back to re-establish the initial delta back to 0.

90< 0. 90 again so you're selling the delta 0.

90 again so you're selling the delta 0. 98< 0.

#### Topic 1

98 and then you're buying back the 0. 98 and then you're buying back the 0.

90< 0. 90 so this way you will always be 0.

90 so this way you will always be taking< taking some profit off the table and taking some profit off the table and re-establishing< re-establishing the initial delta so i re-establishing the initial delta so i will< will go through this more with you with will go through this more with you with an< an actual trade example so you can have an actual trade example so you can have a< a better understanding but for now a better understanding but for now understand< understand that if your leaves option is understand that if your leaves option is in< in a profit then you most likely only in a profit then you most likely only want< want to do a roll out and roll up right want to do a roll out and roll up. right roll< roll out and up to take some profit off roll out and up to take some profit off the< the table the table now< now this is more of the now this is more of the trouble< trouble or rather more of the trouble or rather more of the dilemma< dilemma you have to face if you're in a dilemma you have to face if you're in a loss< loss right say you enter into your loss right say you enter into your call< call leaps option call leaps option and< and then the market has dropped since and then the market has dropped since when< when you enter so when you enter so most< most likely let's say for example you most likely let's say for example you started< started off with 0. 90 and as the market started off with 0.

90 and as the market went< went down your delta also went down and went down your delta also went down and let's<. let's say your delta goes all the way let's say your delta goes all the way down< down to maybe something like 0. 70 down to maybe something like 0.

70 so< so at this point of time you are still so at this point of time you are still bullish< bullish in the outlook of your stock bullish in the outlook of your stock let's< let's say you still think that the let's say you still think that the market< market will go will still go up in the market will go will still go up in the long< long term you want to continue this long term you want to continue this position< position then there's two ways for you position then there's two ways for you to< to roll. this right the first way you to roll this right the first way you want< want to roll is to simply just roll out want to roll is to simply just roll out to< to re-establish the same strike price to re-establish the same strike price right< right let's say for example the strike right let's say for example the strike price< price that you entered down here let's price that you entered down here let's say< say it's a 100 strike price let's just say it's a 100 strike price let's just say< say for example 100 strike price is 0. 9 say for example 100 strike price is 0.

9 deltas< deltas right deltas right so< so if you were to roll out basically you so if you were to roll out basically you will< will still be rolling to the same strike will still be rolling to the same strike price< price at 100 price at 100 and< and then you will be. re-establishing the and then you will be re-establishing the same< same uh same uh initial< initial uh risk which you had which uh initial uh risk which you had which uh the< the initial the initial intrinsic< intrinsic value risk right so for intrinsic value risk right so for example< example if you roll from 0. 7 with a dte example if you roll from 0.

7 with a dte let's< let's say it has dte of 60 left and then let's say it has dte of 60 left and then you< you roll it out to the dte of another you roll it out to the dte of another let's< let's say dte of let's say dte of 500< 500 so you're renewing all the way by 500 so you're renewing all the way by more< more than a year so what you want to do more than a year so what you want to do is< is that you will still keep the same 100 is that you will still keep the same 100 strike< strike price. right if you keep the 100 strike price right if you keep the 100 strike< strike price your intrinsic value is strike price your intrinsic value is still< still the same but you would need to pay still the same but you would need to pay more< more in terms of your extrinsic value more in terms of your extrinsic value because< because remember extrinsic value is because remember extrinsic value is highest< highest when it's closer at the money so highest when it's closer at the money so when< when you first started off you bought a when you first started off you bought a leaves< leaves option where the delta is 0. 9 so leaves option where the delta is 0.

9 so this< this is very deep in the money so when this is very deep in the money so when it's< it's deep in the money your extrinsic. it's deep in the money your extrinsic value< value is much lesser but now that it has value is much lesser but now that it has gone< gone to 0. 70 gone to 0.

70 your< your delta has dropped your extrinsic your delta has dropped your extrinsic value< value has actually increased right your value has actually increased right your extrinsic< extrinsic value has. increased because it extrinsic value has increased because it is< is now is now closer< closer to at the money which is around closer to at the money which is around 0. 5< 0.

#### Topic 2

5 right so you go from deep in the 0. 5 right so you go from deep in the money< money to slightly closer to at the money money to slightly closer to at the money at< at this point of time your extrinsic at this point of time your extrinsic value< value has increased and if you were to value has increased and if you were to roll< roll to the same strike then your roll to the same strike then your extrinsic< extrinsic value will be rolling from extrinsic value will be rolling from this< this amount to a higher amount as well this amount to a higher amount as well that< that is why you'll be paying more in that is why you'll be paying more in terms< terms of extrinsic value so in this case terms of extrinsic value so in this case although< although you keep your intrinsic value although you keep your intrinsic value risk< risk the same risk the same you'll< you'll be x you'll be actually you'll be x you'll be actually increasing< increasing your extrinsic value increasing your extrinsic value risk< risk because previously you bought a risk because previously you bought a certain<. certain amount of extrinsic value when certain amount of extrinsic value when you< you roll it to a further you roll it to a further uh< uh days to expiration that is closer at uh days to expiration that is closer at the< the money you're going to pay much more the money you're going to pay much more in< in extrinsic value and again i'm going in extrinsic value and again i'm going to< to show this to you in example later on to show this to you in example later on but< but for now you just need to understand but for now you just need to understand uh< uh that this is actually increasing the uh that this is actually increasing the most< most in terms you're paying the most in most in terms you're paying the most in terms< terms of extrinsic value now the next terms of extrinsic value now the next would< would be to roll up and down to would be to roll up and down to re-establish< re-establish your initial delta right so re-establish your initial delta right so in< in this case you have 0.

7 okay so now in this case you have 0. 7 okay so now instead< instead of rolling to the same instead of rolling to the same strike< strike price you want to roll to a lower strike price you want to roll to a lower strike< strike price so let me just draw an strike price so let me just draw an arrow< arrow down here if you roll to a lower arrow down here if you roll to a lower strike< strike price let's say. you roll to a 80 strike price let's say you roll to a 80 strike< strike price this time from 100 to 80 strike price this time from 100 to 80 what< what happens is that you're actually what happens is that you're actually topping< topping up the intrinsic value again topping up the intrinsic value again right< right you're topping up the intrinsic right you're topping up the intrinsic value< value game from 100 to 80.

so this is value game from 100 to 80. so this is where< where you are topping up your money where you are topping up your money where< where you're paying the difference where you're paying the difference between< between 480 which is about 20 points between 480 which is about 20 points right< right so you're paying up about two more right so you're paying up about two more two< two. thousand dollars more in terms of two thousand dollars more in terms of intrinsic< intrinsic value and for this you'll be intrinsic value and for this you'll be paying< paying lesser extrinsic value because paying lesser extrinsic value because right< right now right now what< what you have done is you have shifted what you have done is you have shifted from< from 0.

7 deltas you have shifted all the from 0. 7 deltas you have shifted all the way< way to maybe to re-establish. the same way to maybe to re-establish the same delta< delta as 0.

90 delta as 0. 90 so< so if you were to re-establish the same so if you were to re-establish the same initial< initial delta which you first bought or initial delta which you first bought or initiate< initiate your leaves at what will happen initiate your leaves at what will happen is< is that your extrinsic value will be is that your extrinsic value will be roughly< roughly the same as when you first roughly the same as when you first bought< bought it right given that the days to bought it right given that the days to expiration< expiration is similar and the volatility expiration is similar and the volatility doesn't< doesn't really change much right so what doesn't really change much right so what you're< you're doing instead is you're topping you're doing instead is you're topping up< up intrinsic value and then you're up intrinsic value and then you're paying< paying a little in terms of extrinsic paying a little in terms of extrinsic value< value so let's take a look at some trade value so let's take a look at some trade examples< examples so you understand what i mean examples so you understand what i mean by< by the way this video has been helpful by the way this video has been helpful to< to you so far please give me a thumbs up to you so far please give me a thumbs up and< and hit the subscribe button so i can and hit the subscribe button so i can create< create more videos like this for you in create more videos like this for you in the< the future okay back to the video all the future okay back to the video all right< right so let's take a look at the first right so let's take a look at the first three< three examples this is if you are. in a three examples this is if you are in a profit< profit all right so this is on unh uh i profit all right so this is on unh uh i bought< bought the leaps a deep in money called bought the leaps a deep in money called lips< lips somewhere around this price down lips somewhere around this price down here< here in the on the first of october as here in the on the first of october as you< you can see now this was part of a poor you can see now this was part of a poor man's< man's cover call trade where i had a man's cover call trade where i had a short< short call as well uh to accompany this short call as well uh to accompany this call< call leap right but for this example call leap right but for this example right< right i'm just going to show you the right i'm just going to show you the long< long call leap side right of of how i long call leap side right of of how i manage< manage this uh deep in the money called manage this uh deep in the money called leap< leap so leap so as< as you can see on this date down here i as you can see on this date down here i bought< bought the deep in the money call leave bought the deep in the money call leave and< and the market has gone and the market has gone all< all the way up right it has gone all the way up right it has gone pretty< pretty high from when i first entered my pretty high from when i first entered my trade< trade now i've already gotten out of my trade now i've already gotten out of my trade< trade roughly around 480 470.

trade roughly around 480 470. uh< uh it was quite a decent profit but of uh it was quite a decent profit but of course< course you know if i held longer it course you know if i held longer it would< would have made more but who knows right would have made more but who knows right so< so let's take a look at the option chain so let's take a look at the option chain to< to take a look at how much it would be to take a look at how much it would be worth< worth right now if i held on to this uh worth right now if i held on to this uh dividend< dividend money call lip so you can see dividend money call lip so you can see that< that i bought it for that i bought it for 187< 187 dollars and seventy two cents right 187 dollars and seventy two cents right so< so there's roughly eighteen thousand so there's roughly eighteen thousand seven< seven hundred dollars so this has an seven hundred dollars so this has an expiration< expiration of 20 january 2023. so expiration of 20 january 2023 so as< as of this video there's still quite as of this video there's still quite some< some time left there's about 151 days some time left there's about 151 days left< left so this is the strike which i left so this is the strike which i bought< bought all right so it is a 200 strike bought all right so it is a 200 strike call< call lip right so you can see at this call lip right so you can see at this 200< 200 strike price 200 strike price you< you can see that the price right now the you can see that the price right now the mark< mark is roughly mark is roughly 348 348 348 right< right around 350 i bought it for 187 right around 350 i bought it for 187 which< which is not bad which is quite a good which is not bad which is quite a good decent< decent profit so when i first initiated decent profit so when i first initiated trade< trade it was around trade it was around 0.

90< 0. 90 deltas right i bought it at roughly 0.

90 deltas right i bought it at roughly 0. 90< 0.

90 and if you take a look at the delta 0. 90 and if you take a look at the delta now< now it has gone up considerably now it has gone up considerably it's< it's very close to one and this is it's very close to one and this is pretty< pretty much i think this is the maximum pretty much i think this is the maximum which< which the delta can go for this leap which the delta can go for this leap option< option so it's pretty much one for one option so it's pretty much one for one dollar< dollar move right now every underlying dollar move right now every underlying uh< uh every one dollar move the underlying uh every one dollar move the underlying stock< stock moves the call leap option will stock moves the call leap option will also< also gain by 99 cents close to a dollar also gain by 99 cents close to a dollar so< so at this point of time let's say that so at this point of time let's say that there< there is roughly 90 days left right there is roughly 90 days left right let's< let's assume there's 90 days left and i let's assume there's 90 days left and i want< want to roll it so if i want to roll it want to roll it so if i want to roll it there's< there's two ways i can consider doing there's two ways i can consider doing that< that right the first way is to roll it that right the first way is to roll it to< to the same strike so from the 200 to the same strike so from the 200 strike< strike i'm going to roll it to the same strike i'm going to roll it to the same 200< 200 strike 200 strike so< so in this case i still keep the same so in this case i still keep the same intrinsic< intrinsic value right i do not change it intrinsic value right i do not change it at< at all all i'm doing is that i'll be at all all i'm doing is that i'll be topping< topping up the extrinsic value which is topping up the extrinsic value which is this< this number down here right so this this number down here right so this exchange exchange exchange is< is four dollars and uh the extrinsic is four dollars and uh the extrinsic value< value that currently have is about 65 so value that currently have is about 65 so basically< basically what i'll be doing is that i basically what i'll be doing is that i will< will be selling off this i'll be selling will be selling off this i'll be selling roughly< roughly around three four nine and i roughly around three four nine and i will< will be buying it at three five two so will be buying it at three five two so if< if you notice this will be a debit right if you notice this will be a debit right i'll< i'll be paying roughly about two to a i'll be paying roughly about two to a three< three dollars three dollars to< to extend the life of this uh option to extend the life of this uh option this< this call lips which is actually not too this call lips which is actually not too bad< bad right considering i'm only gonna pay bad right considering i'm only gonna pay two< two to three hundred dollars to extend two to three hundred dollars to extend another another another maybe< maybe four hundred days three to four maybe four hundred days three to four hundred< hundred days hundred days about< about a year which is pretty good right about a year which is pretty good right but< but the thing is that i'm already in but the thing is that i'm already in profit< profit right i already made. quite a bit profit right i already made quite a bit of< of money on this trade why do i want to of money on this trade why do i want to you< you know pay a little bit more you know you know pay a little bit more you know increase< increase my overall break-even and increase my overall break-even and overall< overall risk when i'm already in profit overall risk when i'm already in profit what< what i would rather do is to take the what i would rather do is to take the trade< trade right some profits off the table trade right some profits off the table right< right for example if you were to own right for example if you were to own shares< shares what you might consider doing is shares what you might consider doing is to< to take a few shares off the table you to take a few shares off the table you sell< sell some shares you to collect some sell some shares you to collect some profit< profit so in a sense this is very profit so in a sense this is very similar< similar because for the leaps option similar because for the leaps option you< you can actually just roll to a higher you can actually just roll to a higher strike< strike price right when i first started strike price right when i first started off< off it was 200 stride i can roll to off it was 200 stride i can roll to re-establish< re-establish the same delta right so if re-establish the same delta right so if the< the delta is 90 i'll just take a look at the delta is 90 i'll just take a look at the< the delta which i want to re-establish the delta which i want to re-establish and< and i can see that it is and i can see that it is at< at this strike price which is 310 at this strike price which is 310 so< so instead i would just roll it to the so instead i would just roll it to the 310< 310 strike price right so what i'll be 310 strike price right so what i'll be doing< doing is i'll be selling away the 200 doing is i'll be selling away the 200 strike< strike price i'll be selling away at strike price i'll be selling away at roughly< roughly 349 dollars and then buying at roughly 349 dollars and then buying at roughly< roughly 253 roughly 253 so< so what does this do right so this is so what does this do right so this is actually< actually a credit roll because i am actually a credit roll because i am selling< selling away that more expensive a more selling away that more expensive a more expensive< expensive option and then now i'm buying expensive option and then now i'm buying a< a cheaper option so what this does is a cheaper option so what this does is actually< actually it takes profit off the table actually it takes profit off the table and< and at the same time i'm still and at the same time i'm still continuing< continuing my long-term bullish view on continuing my long-term bullish view on the< the stock right let's see i'm still very the stock right let's see i'm still very bullish< bullish i think it will continue to go bullish i think it will continue to go up< up i will do this role up i will do this role all< all right so as you can see if i were to all right so as you can see if i were to roll< roll from the 200 strike price i roll to roll from the 200 strike price i roll to the< the 310 strike price to re-initiate the the 310 strike price to re-initiate the original< original 0.

#### Topic 3

90 deltas then you will see original 0. 90 deltas then you will see that< that the that the amount< amount i will receive is actually a amount i will receive is actually a credit< credit so i'll actually be paid 9 credit so i'll actually be paid 9 547 547 547 just< just to roll to a higher strike price just to roll to a higher strike price because< because right now i'm just taking because right now i'm just taking profits< profits off the table right i'm taking profits off the table right i'm taking profits< profits off table i'm reducing my profits off table i'm reducing my initial< initial risk as well so let's say in initial risk as well so let's say in case< case let's say touchwood the market was case let's say touchwood the market was to< to crash and somehow it goes to zero i'm to crash and somehow it goes to zero i'm not< not going to lose that much overall not going to lose that much overall because< because i've already taken some credit because i've already taken some credit off< off the table of my initial reach the off the table of my initial reach the initial< initial risk was 187 initial risk was 187 i've< i've already taken off roughly 95 so i've already taken off roughly 95 so that's< that's about half i would say so there's that's about half i would say so there's only< only half of the risk left on the table only half of the risk left on the table all< all right so this is how i roll it if all right so this is how i roll it if it's< it's in profit now let's take a look at it's in profit now let's take a look at the< the next trade example and this is if the next trade example and this is if you< you are in a loss and this is a current you are in a loss and this is a current trade< trade that i am still holding on to and trade that i am still holding on to and that< that is crm so you can see on this date that is crm so you can see on this date roughly< roughly on the 10th of january roughly on the 10th of january 2022< 2022 where i entered into a deep money 2022 where i entered into a deep money call< call leap at roughly this price right call leap at roughly this price right it's< it's around 220 something right so i it's around 220 something right so i paid< paid 115 paid 115 for< for the strike at 115 right so this is for the strike at 115 right so this is just< just nice 50 just nice 50 of< of the total price that i'm paying for of the total price that i'm paying for uh< uh the leaps option right so 115 dollars uh the leaps option right so 115 dollars is< is my total risk so at this point of is my total risk so at this point of time< time you can see the moment i entered time you can see the moment i entered the< the market has just gone in a in a very the market has just gone in a in a very just< just downward move right the market is just downward move right the market is going< going down and right now this quality is going down and right now this quality is still< still in a loss and i'm holding on to it still in a loss and i'm holding on to it because< because i'm still very bullish on crm because i'm still very bullish on crm in< in the very long term so what do i want in the very long. term so what do i want to< to do to do now< now that there's a lesser time left in now that there's a lesser time left in the the the the< the expiration date so the expiration date so again< again as you can see there's a position again as you can see there's a position down< down here i have an existing position down here i have an existing position down< down here so at the moment i'm not down here so at the moment i'm not looking< looking to row because there's still 151 looking to row because there's still 151 days< days left right i'm only looking to roll days left right i'm only looking to roll once< once there's a lesser than 90 days left once there's a lesser than 90 days left so< so let's say if i were to roll this so let's say if i were to roll this right< right now right now right< right you can see there are two options right you can see there are two options that< that you can choose to row to right so that you can choose to row to right so this< this is the strike one one five now i this is the strike one one five now i can< can choose to roll to the same strike can choose to roll to the same strike price< price right if i roll to 115 what price right if i roll to 115 what is< is happening right here is that i'm is happening right here is that i'm actually< actually maintaining the intrinsic value actually maintaining the intrinsic value risk< risk right the intrinsic value has not risk right the intrinsic value has not changed< changed since i've purchased it because changed since i've purchased it because i'm< i'm rolling to the same strike but what i'm rolling to the same strike but what has< has increased is my extrinsic value has increased is my extrinsic value because< because right now i'm paying more for because right now i'm paying more for the< the extrinsic value to extend the life the extrinsic value to extend the life from< from 151 to the five one five days to from 151 to the five one five days to expiration< expiration so if you were to take a look expiration so if you were to take a look at< at this row which is this one down here at this row which is this one down here right right right the< the row which i'm doing is to the same the row which i'm doing is to the same strike< strike price but to a further expiration strike price but to a further expiration date< date and you can see that i'm actually date and you can see that i'm actually paying< paying a debit of nine dollars and sixty paying a debit of nine dollars and sixty cents< cents so i'm paying nine hundred and cents so i'm paying nine hundred and sixty< sixty dollars to extend the life from sixty dollars to extend the life from one< one five one to five one five so when i one five one to five one five so when i do< do this do this what< what happens is that i'm maintaining the what happens is that i'm maintaining the same< same intrinsic value risk but i'm same intrinsic value risk but i'm extending< extending or increasing my extrinsic extending or increasing my extrinsic value< value risk just to increase the life value risk just to increase the life form< form uh the life of these options so form uh the life of these options so this< this uh this uh delta< delta you can see has gone from delta you can see has gone from 0.

92< 0. 92 or rather 0.

92 or rather 0. 92< 0.

92 it will decrease to 0. 92 it will decrease to 0.

87< 0. 87 with the same strike price so uh 0.

87 with the same strike price so uh because because because this this this price< price right now price right now at< at 115 is the same strike as this as the at 115 is the same strike as this as the time< time you know increases your this delta time you know increases your this delta actually< actually drops it drops lesser and it's actually drops it. drops lesser and it's more< more closer towards the at the money and more closer towards the at the money and that's< that's why your extrinsic value is that's why your extrinsic value is pretty< pretty high right it's much higher than pretty high right it's much higher than if< if you were to bought somewhere you know if you were to bought somewhere you know around< around 0. 90 so when i increase the around 0.

90 so when i increase the lifespan< lifespan of this i'm paying much more in lifespan of this i'm paying much more in 960< 960 which also means i increase my 960 which also means i increase my overall< overall break even price so my overall break even price so my break-even< break-even price the original this would break-even price the original this would be< be the amount i paid for plus the. strike be the amount i paid for plus the strike so< so it will be 230 dollars right so this so it will be 230 dollars right so this is< is one thing to take note off when is one thing to take note off when you're you're you're rolling< rolling out just to the same strike rolling out just to the same strike when< when i do this i pay at addition 960. so when i do this i pay at addition 960.

so right< right now my overall risk will increase. right now my overall risk will increase by< by 960. so if i add this by 960 right by 960.

so if i add this by 960 right now< now my break even is no longer at 230 my now my break even is no longer at 230 my break< so< so now i've increased the break even by so now i've increased the break even by nine< nine dollars and sixty cents but i only nine dollars and sixty cents but i only pay< pay you know much lesser than if i was pay you know much lesser than if i was to< to roll up and down all right so this is to roll up and down all right so this is the< the next role that uh you can consider the next role that uh you can consider doing< doing this will be rolling up and down doing. this will be rolling up and down so< so what happens down here is that so what happens down here is that instead< instead of rolling to the same strike instead of rolling to the same strike you< you want to roll to a you want to roll to a deeper< deeper in the money strike deeper in the money strike so< so you roll to the 80 strike price what so you roll to the 80 strike price what happened< happened is that you're actually going happened is that you're actually going to< to top up the intrinsic value from 115 to top up the intrinsic value from 115 to< to zero right so previously let's say if to zero right so previously let's say if i< i had the 1. 5 strike price let's say i had the 1.

#### Topic 4

5 strike price let's say this< this is the 1. 5 strike price based on this is the 1.

5 strike price based on the< the market price back at that time the market price back at that time right< right you will you will see this in the right you will you will see this in the other< other videos that i created the other videos that i created the intrinsic< intrinsic value is that basically the intrinsic value is that basically the difference< difference from the market price to the difference from the market. price to the struck< struck price now if i were to roll this struck price now if i were to roll this to< to the 80 strike price it just means to the 80 strike price it just means that< that right now i have to top up this that right now i have to top up this amount< amount right previously if the market amount right previously if the market was< was to drop past 1. 5 i'm not going to was to drop past 1.

5 i'm not going to lose< lose any more in terms of intrinsic lose any more in terms of intrinsic value< value the intrinsic value i only can value the intrinsic value i only can lose< lose for uh. the amount that i can lose lose for uh the amount that i can lose is< is whatever i paid for if the market was is whatever i paid for if the market was to< to drop below 1. 5 to drop below 1.

5 i< i cannot lose more than this 1. 5 i i cannot lose more than this 1.

5 i already< already lost the maximum intrinsic value already lost the maximum intrinsic value everything< everything else will be extrinsic value everything else will be extrinsic value loss< loss right now if i was to roll to the loss right now if i was to roll to the 80< 80 strike price 80 strike price right< right now i need to top up this amount i right now i need to top up this amount i top< top of this amount from 115 to 80 that top of this amount from 115 to 80 that is< is roughly about a 35 points increase is roughly about a 35 points increase sometimes< sometimes i'm going to top up at sometimes i'm going to top up at additional< additional 3 500 for this now you might additional 3 500 for this now you might be< be wondering why do i want to do that be wondering why do i want to do that right< right why do i want to pay up even more right why do i want to pay up even more increase<. increase my risk increase my risk rather< rather than just roll to the same strike rather than just roll to the same strike price< price and the reason is because of the price and the reason is because of the break< break even right break even right the< the break-even as well as the delta gain the break-even as well as the delta gain now< now let me just remove all of this so now let me just remove all of this so you< you can see it more clearly now if i you can see it more clearly now if i were< were to take a look at the overall break were to take a look at the overall break even< even right now this is how we will even right now this is how we will calculate< calculate it right so first we will take calculate it right so first we will take the the the uh uh uh the< the amount which we paid for this all the amount which we paid for this all right< right so we paid 38. 6 for this right so we paid 38.

6 for this and< and then we add on to the amount which and then we add on to the amount which we< we had initially paid for the leaps when we had initially paid for the leaps when we< we first bought it at the start it's we first bought it at the start it's plus< plus 115 and then now we add the. strike plus 115 and then now we add the strike price price price that< that we have right now which is 80 that we have right now which is 80 strike< strike price so we plus an 80 strike price so we plus an 80 80< 80 points now we get a break even of 80 points now we get a break even of 233. 6 233.

6 233. 6 so< so now our break even is 233.

6 so now our break even is 233. 6 now< now previously if you recall now previously if you recall just< just by rolling out using this uh just by rolling out using this uh amount< amount our break even is actually at two amount our break even is actually at two three< three nine point six so if you notice three nine point six so if you notice our< our break even actually increased our break even actually increased by< by rolling out by rolling out right< right although you pay lesser your break right although you pay lesser your break even<. even is actually much higher because all even is actually much higher because all you're< you're doing is just paying extrinsic you're doing is just paying extrinsic value< value but whereas for rolling up and value but whereas for rolling up and down< down you are topping up your intrinsic down you are topping up your intrinsic value< value and you're only topping out very value and you're only topping out very little< little in terms of extrinsic value again little in terms of extrinsic value again in< in fact the extrinsic value is only 3.

60 in fact the extrinsic value is only 3. 60 so< so in a sense while you are increasing so in a sense while you are increasing the< the capital of the trade your break even the capital of the trade your break even is< is actually lower and the other plus is actually lower and the other plus point< point about rolling up and down is point about rolling up and down is because< because of the delta right so you see because of the delta right so. you see here< here if you were to here if you were to roll< roll it out just to the same strike roll it out just to the same strike price< price right the same strike price at 115 price right the same strike price at 115 which< which is this one down here right so on which is this one down here right so on the< the way down the way down you< you started to lose let's say 0.

#### Topic 5

92 you started to lose let's say 0. 92 right< right you're losing 92 cents right you're losing 92 cents for< for each time the dollar uh each time for each time the dollar uh each time the< the underlying stock moves a dollar down the underlying stock moves. a dollar down you're< you're learning 92 cents but then if you you're learning 92 cents but then if you were< were to re-establish the same strike were to re-establish the same strike price< price you will start out with 0.

87 price you will start out with 0. 87 right< right so on the way up of course it right so on the way up of course it increases< increases and this decreases but as the increases and this decreases but as the starting< starting point right what you're doing starting point right what you're doing is< is that you're actually losing more on is that you're actually losing more on the< the way down but then when you make on the way down but then when you make on the< the way up you're actually making the way up you're actually making slightly< slightly lesser right you're making slightly lesser right you're making point< point eight seven point eight eight point eight seven point eight eight point point point on< on the way up so what it means is that on the way up so what it means is that from< from the point of time when you entered from the point of time when you entered the< the price let's say this is the entry the price let's say this is the entry price< price i'll put e down here as the entry price i'll put e down here as the entry price. price price if< if the market was to just go back up to if the market was to just go back up to the< the same point as when you first bought the same point as when you first bought it< it but because you have rolled out to it but because you have rolled out to the< the same strike price you notice that the same strike price you notice that you< you actually do not make back the money you actually do not make back the money that< that you have initially lost that you have initially lost on< on the way down that is because your on the way down that is because your delta< delta is much lesser and that is why delta is much lesser and that is why your< your break-even price is much higher but your break-even price is much higher but if< if i was to roll through the if i was to roll through the lower< lower strike price right to the 80 lower strike price right to the 80 strike< strike price you notice i start out at strike price you notice i start out at 0.

94< 0. 94 so if i were to start up at 0.

94 0. 94 so if i were to start up at 0.

94 and< and as the market goes up it increases and. as the market goes up it increases to to to 95. 9697< 95.

9697 it means that on the way up i 95. 9697 it means that on the way up i actually< actually make more than on the way down actually make more than on the way down which< which also means that the moment it goes which also means that the moment it goes back< back to my entry price right when i back to my entry price right when i first< first entered into the leaves initially first entered into the leaves initially i< i will be at a break even or even at a i will be at a break even or even at a profit< profit at this point of time because i profit at this point of time because i make< make more on the way up so that is why i make more on the way up so that is why i always< always choose to enter into a row out always choose to enter into a row out and< and down and down rolling< rolling for rolling for loss< loss if my colleagues option is in a loss if my colleagues option is in a loss< loss so these are the two things that loss so these are the two things that you< you need to think of when you're rolling you need to think of when you're rolling now< now of course if you don't have that now of course if you don't have that much< much of a capital much of a capital to< to continue rolling up and down or you to continue rolling up and down or you do< do not want to take on more capital risk do not want to take on more capital risk then< then you can of course just roll out to then you can of course just roll out to the< the same strike price right but if you the same strike price right but if you are< are no longer bullish on the on the are no longer bullish on the on the overall< overall stock then it's best to just overall stock then it's best to just close< close out your stock get out for a loss close out your stock get out for a loss and< and then enter into another trade and then enter into another trade altogether< altogether all right so let's have some altogether all right so let's have some takeaways takeaways takeaways so< so the first takeaway is that rolling so the first takeaway is that rolling your< your deep with. money call list helps your deep with money call list helps extend< extend the lifespan and continue the extend the lifespan and continue the bullish< bullish view on the underlying stock so bullish view on the underlying stock so this< this is the key word down here you must this is the key word down here you must still< still be bullish on the underlying stock still be bullish on the underlying stock if< if you're not sure or you're you don't if you're not sure or you're you don't think< think the market will go up then there's think the market will go up then there's no< no point to extend the lifespan because no point to extend the lifespan because what< what you're doing is that you're only what you're doing is that you're only further< further increasing your risk further increasing your risk and< and you're gonna lose more money if the and you're gonna lose more money if the market< market doesn't go up in the long term market doesn't go up in the long term right< right remember when you're rolling right remember when you're rolling you're< you're always taking on more extrinsic you're always taking on more extrinsic value< value risk next that is why you always value risk next that is why you always want< want to roll if you're still bullish on want to roll if you're still bullish on the< the underlying stock next you want to the underlying stock next you want to roll< roll when the dte is less than 90 again roll when the dte is less than 90 again it's< it's because that there is a higher it's because that there is a higher theta< theta decay as the time frame of the theta decay as the time frame of the options< options gets shorter options gets shorter now< now if it's in a profit you roll out and now if it's in a profit you roll out and up< up to take some profits off the table up to take some profits off the table and< and you re-establish the initial delta and you re-establish the initial delta of< of your position so this will take some of your position so this will take some risk< risk of the table so basically as i risk of the table so basically as i mentioned< mentioned you will be rolling from mentioned you will be rolling from somewhere< somewhere from 1.

95 dollars you want to somewhere from 1. 95 dollars you want to roll< roll back down to 0.

90 take some profit roll back down to 0. 90 take some profit take< take some risk off the table but if you take some risk off the table but if you are< are in a loss then there are two options are in a loss then there are two options right< right so you can first start off by right so you can first start off by rolling< rolling out to re-establish the steam rolling out to re-establish the steam strike< strike price but in this case you'll be strike price but in this case you'll be paying< paying more in terms of extrinsic value paying more in terms of extrinsic value but< but you keep the same intrinsic value but you keep the same intrinsic value risk< risk so you do not increase your capital risk so you do not increase your capital risk< risk in terms of intrinsic value risk in terms of intrinsic value so< so you're just extending the time value so you're just extending the time value of< of your call leaps option that's rolling of your call leaps option that's rolling out< out but you always have a higher break out but you always have a higher break even< even price so to keep in mind that next even price so to keep in mind that next will< will be roll out and down to will be roll out and down to re-establish< re-establish the same delta so in this re-establish the same delta so in this case< case you'll be topping up your intrinsic case you'll be topping up your intrinsic value< value but you'll be paying lesser in value but you'll be paying lesser in extrinsic< extrinsic value so in this case you will extrinsic value so in this case you will have< have a lower break-even point right that have a lower break-even point right that means< means it's easier for you to make money means it's easier for you to. make money as< as the market goes up now both will as the market goes up now both will increase< increase your initial risk and break increase your initial risk and break even< even points so this is one thing to even points so this is one thing to understand< understand so you must again i stress understand so you must again i stress this< this you must still be very bullish on this you must still be very bullish on the< the underlying stock the underlying stock and< and finally it extends your time to be and finally it extends your time to be profitable< profitable because if your view does profitable because if your view does play< play out in the long term especially if play out in the long term especially if you're< you're looking at this in a very long you're looking at this in a very long term< term view for a couple of years then it term view for a couple of years then it does< does make sense for you to increase the does make sense for you to increase the lifespan< lifespan and roll your dip in the money lifespan and roll your dip in the money call< call libs out to a further expiration call libs out to a further expiration date< date all right guys so i hope this video date all right guys so i hope this video has< has been helpful for you if it has i'd has been helpful for you if it has i'd appreciate< appreciate if you give me a thumbs up as appreciate if you give me a thumbs up as well< well as subscribe to my video and as well as subscribe to my video and as always< always thank you for watching i always thank you for watching i appreciate< appreciate your time and may the options appreciate your time and may the options favor<

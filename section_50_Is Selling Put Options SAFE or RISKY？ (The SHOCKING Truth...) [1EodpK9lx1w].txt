specifically let's talk options more specifically let's talk about< about whether selling put options is about whether selling put options is safe< safe or risky because on one hand you safe or risky because on one hand you have< have people saying that you know they have people saying that you know they make< make thousands of dollars each month make thousands of dollars each month selling< selling Productions especially there are selling Productions especially there are a< a lot of YouTubers they will say that a lot of YouTubers they will say that they< they make a lot of money selling put they make a lot of money selling put options< options and there are people saying that options and there are people saying that if< if you want to get consistent income you if you want to get consistent income you should< should be selling put options and you should be selling put options and you also< also have people saying that you can get also have people saying that you can get rich< rich by selling put options but on the rich by selling put options but on the other< other hand you know you have people that other hand you know you have people that got< got into a lot of trouble selling got into a lot of trouble selling Productions< Productions like they said that they got Productions like they said that they got into< into a margin call and they blow up into a margin call and they blow up their< their accounts selling put options or their accounts selling put options or they< they lost all their money because they they lost all their money because they so< so put options and some would say that so put options and some would say that selling< selling put options is extremely risky selling put options is extremely risky and< and that you should never sell put and that you should never sell put options< options so which is which is it safe or options so which is which is it safe or is< is it risky well let's really dive into is it risky well let's really dive into this< this so you get a good understanding this so you get a good understanding about< about what selling put is all about so about what selling put is all about so in< in order to understand the risk of in order to understand the risk of selling< selling boots we have to compare it to selling boots we have to compare it to buying< buying shares because after all if you buying shares because after all if you don't< don't sell puts what you're going to do don't sell puts what you're going to do to< to invest in Market the other to invest in Market the other alternative< alternative will be to buy shares Okay alternative will be to buy shares Okay so< so this is Amazon so let's say that this so this is Amazon so let's say that this is< is the price a hundred dollars is right is the price a hundred dollars is right now< now where you plan to buy the stock okay now where you plan to buy the stock okay you< you might be thinking that this is a you might be thinking that this is a good< good price to enter so you want to enter good price to enter so you want to enter at< at this hundred dollars so what we're at this hundred dollars so what we're gonna< gonna do is that we're going to buy 100 gonna do is that we're going to buy 100 shares< shares at a hundred dollars all right at shares at a hundred dollars all right at the< the same time we're going to the same time we're going to simultaneously< simultaneously also sell one put option simultaneously also sell one put option with< with a strike price of a hundred dollars with a strike price of a hundred dollars so< so what we're gonna do is we're gonna so what we're gonna do is we're gonna compare< compare this to so when you sell the put compare this to so when you sell the put you< you receive a credit of two dollars and you receive a credit of two dollars and fifty< fifty cents that means you receive 250 fifty cents that means you receive 250 premium< premium received premium received so< so now let's assume that the stock went so now let's assume that the stock went down< down to 80 right because after all the down to 80 right because after all the risk< risk is all on the downside so if it risk is all on the downside so if it goes< goes down to eighty dollars the question goes down to eighty dollars the question is< is what is the risk how much does the is what is the risk how much does the 100< 100 shares lose and how much does the 100 shares lose and how much does the shot< shot put lose okay so let's take a look shot put lose okay so let's take a look at< at the risk profile for this so on this at the risk profile for this so on this side< side you can see this is the risk side you can see this is the risk profile< profile of 100 shares profile of 100 shares right< right very straightforward you buy 100 right very straightforward you buy 100 shares< shares at a hundred dollars shares at a hundred dollars what< what is the amount you would stand to what is the amount you would stand to lose< lose if it goes down to 80 so as you can lose if it goes down to 80 so as you can see< see down here see down here very< very straightforward if it goes down to very straightforward if it goes down to 80< 80 your loss will be two thousand 80 your loss will be two thousand dollars< dollars that is because it dropped uh dollars that is because it dropped uh twenty< twenty dollars from a hundred dollars so twenty dollars from a hundred dollars so twenty< twenty dollars per share times a hundred twenty dollars per share times a hundred shares< shares that is two thousand dollars so shares that is two thousand dollars so if< if the shares lose two thousand dollars if the shares lose two thousand dollars how< how much do you lose when you're selling how much do you lose when you're selling puts puts puts so< so if you can see this is the shot put so if you can see this is the shot put graph graph graph all< all right so the shot put uh this is at all right so the shot put uh this is at expiration< expiration this is how much you tend to expiration this is how much you tend to make< make or lose and this is right now each make or lose and this is right now each day< day as time passes this uh curve down day as time passes this uh curve down here< here will slowly go up to match this here will slowly go up to match this curve< curve okay so at this point of time curve okay so at this point of time let's< let's say if the market was to let's say if the market was to immediately< immediately drop to eighty dollars this immediately drop to eighty dollars this is< is what the purple line you'll be is what the purple line you'll be looking< looking at so when it drops to eighty looking at so when it drops to eighty dollars< dollars what you'll be losing if you can dollars what you'll be losing if you can see< see down here is a thousand eight see down here is a thousand eight hundred< hundred and twenty seven dollars right hundred and twenty seven dollars right NX< NX expiration you will lose a thousand NX expiration you will lose a thousand seven< seven hundred and fifty dollars so this seven hundred and fifty dollars so this is< is the box that you take a look at this is the box that you take a look at this is< is the wrist profile so if you notice is the wrist profile so if you notice you< you actually are losing lesser than you actually are losing lesser than buying< buying shares you see if you buy a buying shares you see if you buy a higher< higher chance you'll be losing two higher chance you'll be losing two thousand< thousand dollars if it goes to eighty thousand dollars if it goes to eighty dollars< dollars but when you sell the shot put dollars but when you sell the shot put you're< you're actually losing lesser and the you're actually losing lesser and the reason< reason is because you already collected reason is because you already collected the< the 250 dollars in credit so this amount the 250 dollars in credit so this amount that< that you receive this premium M actually that you receive this premium M actually helps< helps offset the risks that you would helps offset the risks that you would have< have on the downside so let's take a have on the downside so let's take a look< look at this what if the stock goes to look at this what if the stock goes to zero< zero dollars how much do you lose what's zero dollars how much do you lose what's the< the risk so if you were to buy 100 the risk so if you were to buy 100 shares shares shares immediately< immediately you could see the the amount immediately you could see the the amount that< that you lose is ten thousand dollars that you lose is ten thousand dollars let< let me just highlight it here for you so let me just highlight it here for you so you< you can see so it's ten thousand dollars you can see so it's ten thousand dollars down< down here down here well< well just because you bought 100 shares well just because you bought 100 shares at< at a hundred dollars if it goes down to at a hundred dollars if it goes down to zero< zero dollars you lose hundred percent zero dollars you lose hundred percent hundred< hundred dollars per share that's ten hundred dollars per share that's ten thousand< thousand dollars but for the shot put thousand dollars but for the shot. put look< look at this you only lose 9750 and I look at this you only lose 9750 and I don't< don't mean only by this having little don't mean only by this having little money< money what I'm trying to say is that money what I'm trying to say is that you're< you're losing lesser than buying shares you're losing lesser than buying shares so< so if you notice the risk is actually so if you notice the risk is actually lower< lower than buying shares so selling puts lower than buying shares so selling puts have< have a very similar risk profile to have a very similar risk profile to buying< buying shares in fact you lose less buying shares in fact you lose less selling< selling puts which means selling puts is selling puts which means selling puts is actually< actually less riskier than buying shares actually less riskier than buying shares so< so if selling puts is actually less so if selling puts is actually less riskier< riskier than buying shares then why is riskier than buying shares then why is it< it that peoples are saying that you know it that peoples are saying that you know selling< selling puts are risky and that people selling puts are risky and that people are< are blowing up their accounts and are blowing up their accounts and they're< they're getting margin calls and they're they're getting margin calls and they're saying< saying that you should never ever get saying that you should never ever get into< into selling puts ever again and the into selling puts ever again and the answer< answer comes down to this picture right answer comes down to this picture right here< here by the way if you've been enjoying here by the way if you've been enjoying this< this video so far I'd appreciate it if this video so far I'd appreciate it if you< you just hit the Subscribe button and you just hit the Subscribe button and give< give a thumbs up so I can create more give a thumbs up so I can create more videos< videos like this for you in the future videos like this for you in the future alright< alright back to the video so as I was alright back to the video so as I was saying< saying the reason so many people blow up saying the reason so many people blow up their< their accounts and get margin calls is their accounts and get margin calls is because< because of this number right here so because of this number right here so this< this number right here is the main this number right here is the main culprit< culprit all right so what is this number culprit all right so what is this number you< you notice it says this is the buying you notice it says this is the buying power< power effect so essentially this number power effect so essentially this number down< down here is the margin you need to put down here is the margin you need to put up< up for just selling this shot put right up for just selling this shot put right so< so for example if you were to buy a so for example if you were to buy a hundred< hundred shares at this price a hundred hundred shares at this price a hundred dollars< dollars the amount that you need to put dollars the amount that you need to put up< up to buy these shares will be ten up to buy these shares will be ten thousand< thousand dollars as we already know thousand dollars as we already know right< right but if you were to sell the shot right but if you were to sell the shot put< put you actually do not need to put up put you actually do not need to put up the< the ten thousand dollars all you need to the ten thousand dollars all you need to do< do is just put up a thousand dollars and do is just put up a thousand dollars and you< you could sell this put option and you could sell this put option and receive< receive 250 dollars in premium receive 250 dollars in premium so< so here is where the problem really lies so here is where the problem really lies okay< okay so imagine this a lot of people okay so imagine this a lot of people when< when they get into or when they get when they get into or when they get started< started selling put options they'll started selling put options they'll generally< generally you know start off with a generally you know start off with a smaller< smaller account so let's say they have smaller account so let's say they have five< five thousand dollars account okay so five thousand dollars account okay so they< they have a five thousand dollars they have a five thousand dollars account< account and then they take a look at account and then they take a look at this< this number down here which says that this number down here which says that hey< hey you only need to put up a thousand hey you only need to put up a thousand dollars< dollars all right let's let's round this dollars all right let's let's round this down< down to a thousand dollars so they say down to a thousand dollars so they say you< you only need to put up ten uh one you only need to put up ten uh one thousand< thousand dollars and you can get two thousand dollars and you can get two hundred< hundred and fifty dollars in credit so hundred and fifty dollars in credit so they< they go and they start to think they go and they start to think themselves< themselves say hey if I've got five themselves say hey if I've got five thousand< thousand dollars that means I can thousand dollars that means I can actually< actually sell five actually sell five of< of this put options of this put options if< if I sell five of these put options how if I sell five of these put options how much< much premium will I be able to receive much premium will I be able to receive right< right so they have 250 dollars right so they have 250 dollars Day< Day times five Day times five and< and the amount of uh credit or premium and the amount of uh credit or premium which< which they'll receive is a thousand two which they'll receive is a thousand two hundred< hundred and fifty dollars hundred and fifty dollars so< so they'll think to themselves oh wow so they'll think to themselves oh wow that< that is a lot of money because your that is a lot of money because your account< account side is is only five thousand account side is is only five thousand dollars< dollars and you're able to get one dollars and you're able to get one thousand< thousand two hundred fifty dollars in thousand two hundred fifty dollars in terms< terms of Premium just on the capital of terms of Premium just on the capital of five< five thousand dollars so that's what five thousand dollars so that's what they< they did so that is the problem because they did so that is the problem because they< they do not realize the risk that they they do not realize the risk that they actually< actually are having so actually are having so this< this is number that you actually have to this is number that you actually have to pay< pay attention to the big problem is this pay attention to the big problem is this number< number right here so you see this number number right here so you see this number says< says this is the max loss says this is the max loss so< so a lot of people so a lot of people do< do not even bother to look at this do not even bother to look at this number< number what is trying to tell you that number what is trying to tell you that if< if the stock actually goes to zero this if the stock actually goes to zero this is< is what you can lose and if this person is what you can lose and if this person was< was to sell five contracts so you take was to sell five contracts so you take nine< nine thousand seven hundred nine thousand seven hundred and< and fifty dollars and fifty dollars and< and you times five contracts guess what and you times five contracts guess what is< is the risk is the risk the< the risk is let's just take out our the risk is let's just take out our trusty< trusty calculator here trusty calculator here so< so our total risk is 9750 so our total risk is 9750 times< times 5 contract and the total risk is times 5 contract and the total risk is 48< 48 750 dollars forty eight thousand 48 750 dollars forty eight thousand seven< seven hundred and fifty dollars seven hundred and fifty dollars and< and they only have five thousand dollars and they only have five thousand dollars in< in the account the account size is only in the account the account size is only five< five thousand dollars so can you see how five thousand dollars so can you see how the< the account can easily get wiped out the account can easily get wiped out because< because they've gotten too big of a because they've gotten too big of a position< position for their account size position for their account size so< so how much of a move does Amazon need so how much of a move does Amazon need to< to go down in order for this five to go down in order for this five thousand< thousand dollars to be wiped out what is thousand dollars to be wiped out what is how< how how much do you think it needs to go how how much do you think it needs to go down< down well for this let's take a look at down well for this let's take a look at the< the risk graph the risk graph so< so if you would take a look at the risk so if you would take a look at the risk graph< graph you can see this is you have five graph you can see this is you have five short< short put contracts on the the Amazon short put contracts on the the Amazon with< with 100 strike price so you can see with 100 strike price so you can see right< right at the right at the 90. 84< 90.

84 cents you would have lost five 90. 84 cents you would have lost five thousand< thousand and three dollars thousand and three dollars so< so this is why a lot of people lose all so this is why a lot of people lose all their< their account or they get into Margin their account. or they get into Margin Call Call Call right< right the stock all it has to do is drop right the stock all it has to do is drop from< from a hundred dollars all the way to from a hundred dollars all the way to 90.

84< 90. 84 cents and that will wipe out the 90.

84 cents and that will wipe out the whole< whole account of five thousand dollars whole account of five thousand dollars so< so this is the problem that a lot of so this is the problem that a lot of people< people have when they start selling puts people have when they start selling puts because< because they over leverage themselves because they over leverage themselves all< all they see is the amount of money that all they see is the amount of money that they< they make they do not see the risk that they make they do not see the risk that is< is uh they have when they sell all these is uh they have when they sell all these put< put options and this is something that put options and this is something that you< you do not want to get yourself into so you do not want to get yourself into so this< this is actually what happened to a this is actually what happened to a friend< friend of mine all right not too long friend of mine all right not too long ago< ago a friend of mine go into trouble by ago a friend of mine go into trouble by selling< selling way too many puts on Baba right selling way too many puts on Baba right this< this is the stock of Baba at the point this is the stock of Baba at the point of< of time when he came to me I think was of time when he came to me I think was roughly< roughly about 170 180 dollars so what he roughly about 170 180 dollars so what he did< did is he said to me that he sold six did is he said to me that he sold six put< put options at a hundred and sixty put options at a hundred and sixty dollar< dollar strike price for five dollars per dollar strike price for five dollars per option< option right so for six contract he option right so for six contract he would< would receive three thousand dollars and would receive three thousand dollars and he< he came to me and say Davis this is such he came to me and say Davis this is such easy< easy money you should be selling on Baba easy money you should be selling on Baba as< as well so I told him that yes it's easy as well so I told him that yes it's easy money< money if it expires worthless right but money if it expires worthless right but if< if you get exercise if the market was to if you get exercise if the market was to calm< calm down then you're going to get a lot calm down then you're going to get a lot of< of trouble right the problem with what of trouble right the problem with what he< he just did is that his account size is he just did is that his account size is only< only 25 only 25 000< 000 right if you were to get exercise on 000 right if you were to get exercise on the< the full six put options at 160 dollars the full six put options at 160 dollars the< the amount of capital you need to put up the amount of capital you need to put up is< is actually this so again let's put up is actually this so again let's put up our< our calculator our calculator so< so what you would need to get to fulfill so what you would need to get to fulfill the< the obligations of this put contract if the obligations of this put contract if you< you get exercise will be six times 160 you get exercise will be six times 160 and< and times 100 shares and times 100 shares so< so you need 96 000 and he only has 25 so you need 96 000 and he only has 25 000< 000 in his account and the other problem 000 in his account and the other problem is< is that he have actually other positions is that he have actually other positions in< in this account so this is only a small in this account so this is only a small or< so< so as you can see if six contracts were so as you can see if six contracts were exercised< exercised you have total funds that you exercised you have total funds that you need< need will be ninety six thousand dollars need will be ninety six thousand dollars so< so he said Davis don't worry the stock so he said Davis don't worry the stock right< right now has already been selling off right now has already been selling off so< so much that it has found the bottom he so much that it has found the bottom he says< says that half much further can it go says that half much further can it go right< right it has already went down a lot so right it has already went down a lot so I< I told him that you know you never know I told him that you know you never know so< so most important thing is that you got so most important thing is that you got to< to make sure that you're well funded to make sure that you're well funded that< that in case you do get exercise you that in case you do get exercise you need< need to put up the amount of money he need to put up the amount of money he said< said there's no way that will happen said there's no way that will happen well< well not too. long after he actually came well not too long after he actually came back< back to me and told me that his account back to me and told me that his account is< is in trouble because as you can see is in trouble because as you can see Baba< Baba went all the way down to as low as Baba went all the way down to as low as around< around seventy dollars seventy something around seventy dollars seventy something dollars dollars dollars and< and he shot all the way 160 contracts and he shot all the way 160 contracts sorry< sorry a six contracts at 160 dollars so sorry a six contracts at 160 dollars so this< this is a huge move down almost 90 this is a huge move down almost 90 dollars< dollars in a move down so needless to dollars in a move down so needless to say< say he was in big trouble and he was say he was in big trouble and he was about< about to be facing a margin call from about to be facing a margin call from the< the broker so he came to me asking me the broker so he came to me asking me for< for help ask me what should he do so I for help ask me what should he do so I told< told him told him you< you know first of all what happened to you know first of all what happened to the< the easy money right because she said the easy money right because she said that< that it was so easy and that the Baba that it was so easy and that the Baba and< and Baba won't come down but in the end and Baba won't come down but in the end it< it did come down so I told him right now it did come down so I told him right now you< you need to do a few things right number you need to do a few things right number one< one you could either top up more money one you could either top up more money if< if you add more money to your bank if you add more money to your bank account< account or write it to your trading account or write it to your trading account< account then you could fulfill all the account then you could fulfill all the obligations< obligations uh in case you get exercise obligations uh in case you get exercise but< but he said that he didn't have that but he said that he didn't have that much< much cash so I told him that the next much cash so I told him that the next other< other thing that you can do is to other thing that you can do is to basically< basically reduce your exposure that basically reduce your exposure that means< means you have to cut some of these means you have to cut some of these positions< positions right here you have uh he had positions right here you have uh he had six< six short puts I told him that you need six short puts I told him that you need to< to try and cut a lot of it down as well to try and cut a lot of it down as well as< as other positions he has in his account as other positions he has in his account so< so he decided to close some of these so he decided to close some of these puts< puts and I told him for the remainder of puts and I told him for the remainder of the< as< as far out as possible maybe to the as far out as possible maybe to the furthest< furthest expiration date and then try to furthest expiration date and then try to push< push this 160 strike down maybe to 155 push this 160 strike down maybe to 155 or< or even 250 or lower and by doing that or even 250 or lower and by doing that you< you actually reduce the Delta so the you actually reduce the Delta so the impact< impact on your account is not that bad impact on your account is not that bad so< so at this point of time he had no so at this point of time he had no choice< choice but he has to take loss on some choice but he has to take loss on some of< of his positions when in the long run of his positions when in the long run there< there could be a possibility that the there could be a possibility that the market< market could bounce up right so he market could bounce up right so he missed< missed out on all this chance because he missed out on all this chance because he over< over leveraged he decided to sell too over leveraged he decided to sell too many< many contracts for his account size many contracts for his account size and< and this is a very important lesson for and this is a very important lesson for him< him because if he did not experience him because if he did not experience this< this now if he were to get a little bit this now if he were to get a little bit overconfident< overconfident if he made this money on overconfident if he made this money on this< this short uh these six contracts next this short uh these six contracts next round< round he might start to sell more he round he might start to sell more he might< might sell 10 he might sell maybe even might sell 10 he might sell maybe even 20. < 20.

and that will be a big problem next 20. and that will be a big problem next time< time if the market tanks again so time if the market tanks again so there's< there's a very important concept that there's a very important concept that I'd< I'd like you to understand and that is I'd like you to understand and that is the< the term risky versus calculated risk so the term risky versus calculated risk so here's< here's the thing when you come to here's the thing when you come to trading< trading or even investing you cannot trading or even investing you cannot avoid< avoid risk right when you say whether is avoid risk right when you say whether is it< it risky or not there is always risk it risky or not there is always risk because< because when you're putting in money because when you're putting in money into< into the market there's always a chance into the market there's always a chance that< that you can lose it so rather instead that you can lose it so rather instead of< of asking whether is it risky you need of asking whether is it risky you need to< to understand there is something else to understand there is something else that's< that's called calculated risk so when that's called calculated risk so when people< people say selling put option is risky people say selling put option is risky that's< that's because they don't think of the that's because they don't think of the possibility< possibility that the underlying stock possibility that the underlying stock can< can go down they only think of how much can go down they only think of how much they< they can make and that's exactly what they can make and that's exactly what happened< happened to my friend when I asked him happened to my friend when I asked him say< say that what happens if the market goes say that what happens if the market goes down< down he says that he doesn't believe down he says that he doesn't believe that< that Baba will ever go down because he that Baba will ever go down because he has< has been oversold so all they see is how has been oversold so all they see is how much< much potential money they can make but much potential money they can make but they< they totally ignore the risk on the they totally ignore the risk on the downside< downside and that is why they didn't downside and that is why they didn't plan< plan for the worst case scenario if my plan for the worst case scenario if my friend< friend had planned for the worst case friend had planned for the worst case scenario< scenario he would know that there is a scenario he would know that there is a possibility< possibility that if his options get possibility that if his options get exercised< exercised then he would not be able to exercised then he would not be able to fulfill< fulfill the obligation so he will need fulfill the obligation so he will need to< to reduce his size to reduce his size so< so they don't really also understand the so they don't really also understand the strategy< strategy and they definitely didn't have strategy and they definitely didn't have a< a plan instead we want to take a much a plan instead we want to take a much more< more strategic approach which is to have more strategic approach which is to have calculated< calculated risk so calculated risk is calculated risk so calculated risk is when< when you understand that there is a when you understand that there is a possibility< possibility that the stock can go down possibility that the stock can go down right< right every time when you enter a trade right every time when you enter a trade or< or investment you ask yourself that or investment you ask yourself that there< there is a chance that the stock can go there is a chance that the stock can go down< down and if it does are you prepared for down and if it does are you prepared for it< it are you ready for it and then you it are you ready for it and then you have< have to plan for the worst case scenario have to plan for the worst case scenario as< as well as well so< so are you okay with it so this also so are you okay with it so this also comes< comes in terms of diversification right comes in terms of diversification right if< if you put everything into one stock if you put everything into one stock let's< let's say and you are saying you're very let's say and you are saying you're very confident< confident in it that's fine as well if confident in it that's fine as well if you're< you're very confident in the stock but you're very confident in the stock but if< if it goes to zero you need to be able if it goes to zero you need to be able to< to know that this is the risk that you to know that this is the risk that you want< want to accept so want to accept so the< the most important thing is that you the most important thing is that you understand< understand the strategy thoroughly and understand the strategy thoroughly and that< that you accept the risks associated that you accept the risks associated with< with it right and I learned this very with it right and I learned this very early< early on on the importance of calculated early on on the importance of calculated risk< risk when I was working for a risk when I was working for a proprietary< proprietary trading firm over a decade proprietary trading firm over a decade ago< ago so if you're not very familiar on ago so if you're not very familiar on the< the term of what proprietary trading the term of what proprietary trading firm< firm is basically where the company firm is basically where the company their< their funds and then they hire all these their funds and then they hire all these Traders< Traders and then they give funds to Traders and then they give funds to these< these traders to trade the markets and these traders to trade the markets and whenever< whenever they have any profits they just whenever they have any profits they just give< give them a profit share so I want to give them a profit share so I want to share< share with you a very quick story on share with you a very quick story on what< what happened uh when I was at a prop what happened uh when I was at a prop trading< trading firm so you get a better trading firm so you get a better understanding< understanding on the term of risk versus understanding on the term of risk versus calculated< calculated risk calculated risk so< so the one thing about proprietary so the one thing about proprietary training< training firm is that they will give training firm is that they will give money< money to they will fund the accounts of money to they will fund the accounts of the< the Traders and if they make money the Traders and if they make money they'll< they'll give a cut off the share they they'll give a cut off the share they give< give a profit sharing but if the trader give a profit sharing but if the trader was< was to lose money then the trading firm was to lose money then the trading firm actually< actually Bears the risk so the number actually Bears the risk so the number one< one thing that the uh prop trading firm one thing that the uh prop trading firm has< has to do is really manage risk because has to do is really manage risk because if< if they don't one single Trader can if they don't one single Trader can easily< easily just get them out of business and easily just get them out of business and they< they cannot make this happen at all so they cannot make this happen at all so managing< managing risk is very important so I managing risk is very important so I remember< remember the day when I entered the uh remember the day when I entered the uh proprietary< proprietary training from it was my proprietary training from it was my first< first week there was this senior Trader first week there was this senior Trader there< there so the senior Trader has been there so the senior Trader has been there< there for a number of years and if you there for a number of years and if you have< have been there for a number of years have been there for a number of years you< you know it means you're very likely you know it means you're very likely that< that you're profitable otherwise you that you're profitable otherwise you wouldn't< wouldn't be able to stay in the prop wouldn't be able to stay in the prop front< front for years because you some front for years because you some platforms< platforms do not actually pay a salary platforms do not actually pay a salary and< and if they do it's very little so that and if they do it's very little so that is< is why the only way that you can really is why the only way that you can really stay< stay on is if you keep making money in stay on is if you keep making money in the< the markets so this senior Trader there the markets so this senior Trader there has< has actually been there for a number of has actually been there for a number of years< years and that very particular day when years and that very particular day when I< I was there what happened was that all I was there what happened was that all of< of a sudden the boss from his room would of a sudden the boss from his room would stand< stand up and then come out of the room stand up and then come out of the room and< and stand in front of this senior Trader and stand in front of this senior Trader and< and ask him what on Earth is he doing so and ask him what on Earth is he doing so the< the boss was very angry and asked him the boss was very angry and asked him what< what are you doing are you going to get what are you doing are you going to get out< out of the position what are you out of the position what are you planning< planning to do so apparently planning to do so apparently this< this senior Trader has got himself into this senior Trader has got himself into a< a very big position and he has already a very big position and he has already hit< hit the maximum loss that he he can hit hit the maximum loss that he he can hit per< per day so all of us have a risk that a per day so all of us have a risk that a maximum< maximum risk or maximum loss that if we maximum risk or maximum loss that if we hit< hit it for the day we have to close out hit it for the day we have to close out our< our positions and stop training for day our positions and stop training for day so< so this senior Trader has already hit so this senior Trader has already hit that< that amount and has actually passed it that amount and has actually passed it so< so the boss was asking him why isn't he so the boss was asking him why isn't he trying< trying to get out of his positions trying to get out of his positions instead< instead the trader was like a deer in instead the trader was like a deer in the< the headlights he was just staring at the headlights he was just staring at the< the screen and then he just told the the screen and then he just told the boss< boss say that all right I'm gonna just boss say that all right I'm gonna just uh< uh close out this positions once it uh close out this positions once it dropped< dropped a little bit more so the boss dropped a little bit more so the boss told< told him say okay that is your plan all told him say okay that is your plan all right< right if it drops a little bit more you right if it drops a little bit more you are< are out so the boss went back to his are out so the boss went back to his room< room and then sure enough a few minutes room and then sure enough a few minutes later< later the boss stood up again and came later the boss stood up again and came out< out and this time he was extremely mad out and this time he was extremely mad he< he told the trader this senior Trader to he told the trader this senior Trader to get< get out of. his seat get out of his seat and< and then the boss sat down in his seat and then the boss sat down in his seat and< and manually closed all of his positions and manually closed all of his positions and< and you know this is a a very bad thing and you know this is a a very bad thing when< when the boss have to close your when the boss have to close your positions< positions it means that you have screwed positions it means that you have screwed up< up so the boss was uh just holding a lot up so the boss was uh just holding a lot of< of vulgarities at him and the thing what of vulgarities at him and the thing what happened< happened today is that the boss told him happened today is that the boss told him to< to pack up and leave and to never come to pack up and leave and to never come back< back so think about it this way right back so think about it this way right think< think about this this guy is a person think about this this guy is a person that< that has been trading in The Firm for that has been trading in The Firm for many< many years and most likely he has many years and most likely he has probably< probably made quite a bit of money for probably made quite a bit of money for the< the firm and because of this one mistake the firm and because of this one mistake he< he made that he didn't manage his wrist he made that he didn't manage his wrist properly< properly and he managed to get himself properly and he managed to get himself fired< fired after working for so many years so fired after working for so many years so this< this goes to show that the proprietary this goes to show that the proprietary training< training firm is very hard on risk and training firm is very hard on risk and and< and the the moral of this story and the the moral of this story is< is that if you don't have a plan and you is that if you don't have a plan and you don't< don't know exactly how much you can lose don't know exactly how much you can lose in< in a worst case scenario then you in a worst case scenario then you shouldn't< shouldn't be in the trade in the first shouldn't be in the trade in the first place< place so this I believe if you are place so this I believe if you are investing< investing in Market you're trading in investing in Market you're trading in the< the market you're using your hard-earned the market you're using your hard-earned money< money right so if you're using money right

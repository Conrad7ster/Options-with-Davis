08 on their uninvested instantly available< available cash balance so this way when available cash balance so this way when you< you put your money with them the idle you put your money with them the idle cash< cash which you have is actually working cash which you have is actually working for< for you as well right so for example for you as well right so for example let's< let's say if you have a hundred thousand let's say if you have a hundred thousand dollars< dollars in your trading account and dollars in your trading account and let's< let's say you put fifty thousand dollars let's say you put fifty thousand dollars into< into option trades so fifty thousand into option trades so fifty thousand dollars< dollars is being held up right but you dollars is being held up right but you have< have another fifty thousand dollars have another fifty thousand dollars that's< that's just sitting there in cash and that's just sitting there in cash and it's< it's not earning interest well with it's not earning interest well with interactive< interactive brokers this fifty thousand interactive brokers this. fifty thousand dollars< dollars is actually earning you an dollars is actually earning you an interest< interest so this way your money is interest so this way your money is really< really still working hard for you all really still working hard for you all right< right so you have this part that is right so you have this part that is making< making money from your options trading making money from your options trading maybe< maybe you're earning about 10 percent maybe you're earning about 10 percent to< to maybe 20 on this uh part and then the to maybe 20 on this uh part and then the remaining< remaining part when it's not being used remaining part when it's not being used there's< there's still some interest to be gained there's still some interest to be gained right< right until you finally decide to use right until you finally decide to use them< them and it goes to here and those them and it goes to here and those unused< unused ones come back here again and unused ones come back here again and then< then you earn this 4. 08 so it's working then you earn this 4.

08 so it's working really< really hard for you so if you were to go really hard for you so if you were to go to< to their site you can see this right you to their site. you can see this right you can< can see the interactive brokers they can see the interactive brokers they compare< compare it with other Brokers so compare it with other Brokers so interactive< interactive brokers is paying you 4. 08 interactive brokers is paying you 4.

08 whereas< whereas the rest of the Brokers isn't whereas the rest of the Brokers isn't paying< paying you that much right especially TD paying you that much right especially TD Ameritrade< Ameritrade. which is another broker which Ameritrade which is another broker which is< is good for trading options you can see is good for trading options you can see it's< it's only paying you 0. 35 which is not it's only paying you 0.

35 which is not much< much at all so it's not really making much at all so it's not really making your< your money work hard so if you have a your money work hard so if you have a big< big amount I say you have six figures or big amount I say you have six figures or something< something then you want to really something then you want to really consider< consider uh trading with interactive consider uh trading with interactive brokers< brokers because if you have a large brokers because if you have a large amount< amount that is unused at any one time amount that is unused at any one time this< this will not be sitting idly because it this will not be sitting idly because it will< will be earning you an interest will be earning you an interest now< now there is a caveat that you need to now there is a caveat that you need to really< really take note of as you can see down really take note of as you can see down here< here this. fine print down here it says here this fine print down here it says that< that the USD credit interest is paid at that the USD credit interest is paid at the< the stated rate on balances over USD ten the stated rate on balances over USD ten thousand< thousand dollars in Securities account thousand dollars in Securities account with< with nav exceeding USD a hundred with nav exceeding USD a hundred thousand< thousand dollars and accounts with less thousand dollars and accounts with less than< than a hundred thousand dollars in nav than a hundred thousand dollars in nav you'll< you'll receive USD credit interest at you'll receive USD credit interest at rates< rates proportional to the size of the rates proportional to the size of the account account account so< so what does it mean so it just means so what does it mean so it just means that< that if you have less than a hundred that if you have less than a hundred thousand< thousand dollars account you may be thousand dollars account you may be earning< earning lesser than this uh 4. 08 so they earning lesser than this uh 4.

08 so they give< give you an example down here as well on give you an example down here as well on their< their site so you can see for the first their site so you can see for the first ten< ten thousand dollars you're not earning ten thousand dollars you're not earning any< any interest right it's just zero any interest right it's just zero percent< percent now the interest will come from percent now the interest will come from the< the next uh ninety thousand dollars so the next uh ninety thousand dollars so for< for example down here you see ninety for example down here you see ninety thousand< thousand dollars you'll be earning an thousand dollars you'll be earning an interest< interest at two point five eight percent interest at two point five eight percent so< so I believe this is the old grid so the so I believe this is the old grid so the new< new rate is probably around four percent new rate is. probably around four percent so< so if you have any uninvested cash right so if you have any uninvested cash right this< this part will be earning the interest this part will be earning the interest now< now what if you have a trading account now what if you have a trading account size< size that is less than a hundred size that is less than a hundred thousand< thousand dollars so as you can see same thousand dollars so as you can see same thing< thing ten thousand dollars the first ten thing ten thousand dollars the first ten thousand< thousand dollars thousand dollars you're< you're not going to earn any interest you're not going to earn any interest but< but then the next 40 000 let's say is but then the next 40 000 let's say is about< about fifty thousand dollars account about fifty thousand dollars account you're< you're only going to earn half of this you're only going to earn half of this right< right half of this 2. 58 so it becomes right half of this 2.

58 so it becomes divided< divided by two so now the interest rate divided by two so now the interest rate you< you know it's not as good as if you had you know it's not as good as if you had a< a hundred thousand dollars account so a hundred thousand dollars account so for< for most people right when they're just for most people right when they're just starting< starting out chances are they won't starting out chances are they won't start< start out with a hundred thousand start out with a hundred thousand dollars< dollars right most of the time they will dollars right most of the time they will start< start out with a smaller size so in this start out with a smaller size so in this case< case your interest isn't earning that case your interest isn't earning that much< much but hey at least you are earning much but hey at least you are earning some< some interest right that interest could some interest right that interest could at< at least cover you know commissions or at least cover you know commissions or maybe< maybe if you have some losses that maybe if you have some. losses that interests< interests me just help to cushion some interests me just help to cushion some losses< losses so there is actually another losses so there is actually another method< method that would be better than this by method that would be better than this by the< the way if you like this video so far the way if you like this video so far Please< Please Subscribe and also click the Please Subscribe and also click the thumbs< thumbs up button and also do get your thumbs up button and also do get your free< free copy of the options income free copy of the options income blueprint< blueprint where I share the top three blueprint where I share the top three options< options strategies that help you options strategies that help you generate< generate a consistent income each month generate a consistent income each month trading< trading just one to two hours a day trading just one to two hours a day right< right so if you want to go ahead to get right so if you want to go ahead to get this< this card copy just head on over to this card copy just head on over to optionswithdavis. com< optionswithdavis.

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video and that is through back to the video and that is through tastytrade< tastytrade so on tastytrade when I first tastytrade so on tastytrade when I first emailed< emailed them because I wanted to find emailed them because I wanted to find out< out if they actually pay any interest on out if they actually pay any interest on the<. the cash balance on the account right so the cash balance on the account right so I< I messaged them I emailed them and they I messaged them I emailed them and they actually< actually said that if you were to just actually said that if you were to just put< put it in cash balance right they only put it in cash balance right they only pay< pay 0.

01 annualized which is pretty much pay 0. 01 annualized which is pretty much nothing< nothing right but they said if you plan nothing right but they said if you plan on< on selling options for premium you. can on selling options for premium you can purchase< purchase the short-term us T bills where purchase the short-term us T bills where the< the rates are upwards of 4.

#### Topic 1

5 percent the rates are upwards of 4. 5 percent annualized< annualized and you get a 94 release on annualized and you get a 94 release on the< the T bills towards buying power so the T bills towards buying power so here's< here's what this means right so for here's what this means right so for example< example if you have a hundred thousand example if you have a hundred. thousand dollars< dollars in cash balance okay so let's dollars in cash balance okay so let's say< say you put all this into T bills right say you put all this into T bills right you< you put into T bills so on these t-bus you put into T bills so on these t-bus it< it will earn you roughly about say 4.

5 it will earn you roughly about say 4. 5 all< all right so let's say for example we go all right so. let's say for example we go according< according to this email he says 4.

5 up according to this email he says 4. 5 up to< to all right so maybe the average is to all right so maybe the average is around< around four percent so let's say put around four percent so let's say put around< around four percent so a hundred around four percent so a hundred thousand< thousand dollars will be earning you thousand dollars will be earning you four< four percent interest now once you put four percent interest now once you put into< into this tbus this tbu's amount right into this tbus this tbu's amount right the< the money which parked in here is not the money which parked in here is not locked< locked up rather they release 94 of it locked up rather they release 94 of it now< now you have 94 being released as option now you have 94 being released as option buying< buying power which is about ninety four buying power which is about ninety four thousand< thousand dollars so now you have a thousand dollars so now you have a hundred< hundred thousand dollars working for you hundred thousand dollars working for you to< to earn four percent which is pretty to earn four percent which is pretty much< much the full amount which you put in much the full amount which you put in the< the trading account you earn four the trading account you earn four percent< percent on top of that 94 of it can be percent on top of that 94 of it can be taken< taken out to be used to trade options so taken out to be used to trade options so now< now you're earning a return on a return now you're earning a return on a return can< can you see that so this is very much can you see that so this is very much different< different from this interactive brokers different from this interactive brokers so< so interactive brokers is only on your so interactive brokers is only on your uninvested< uninvested cash so let's say a hundred uninvested cash so let's say a hundred thousand< thousand dollars you put 150 000 into thousand dollars you put 150 000 into um< um options trade let's say this is in um options trade let's say this is in options< options for interactive brokers you put options for interactive brokers you put into< into options into options the< the other 50 000 then you earn the the other 50 000 then you earn the interest< interest and as you know anything that interest and as you know anything that is< is under 100K in nav you will earn is under 100K in nav you will earn lesser< lesser interest but when you put it with lesser interest but when you put it with tasty< tasty trade and you buy tea bills tasty trade and you buy tea bills they'll< they'll release this amount for you to they'll release this amount for you to trade< trade this option so imagine from this trade this option so imagine from this ninety< ninety four thousand dollars you're able ninety four thousand dollars you're able to< to generate let's say 10 return so now to generate let's say 10 return so now you< you have 10 and this money is also still you have 10 and this money is also still working< working hard to earn that four percent working hard to earn that four percent so< so suddenly now you're earning much more so suddenly now you're earning much more than< than if you were to just have this than if you. were to just have this trading< trading account they're just fully trading account they're just fully trading< trading options right without putting trading options right without putting into< into T bills so I went to find out a into T bills so I went to find out a little< little bit more I want to do a little little bit more I want to do a little bit< bit more research and as you can see on bit more research and as you can see on their< their site it says down here we margin their site it says down here we margin the< the T bills at 94 in margin accounts the T bills at 94 in margin accounts only< only so one thing to take note is that only so one thing to take note is that if< if you want to do this method you want if you want to do this method you want to< to buy T bills you pretty much have to to buy T bills you pretty much have to use< use a margin account right so as they use a margin account right so as they say< say cash account Ira is not possible so say cash account Ira is not possible so T< T bills are marketable and have a margin T bills are marketable and have a margin requirement< requirement of six percent so if you requirement of six percent so if you deposit< deposit or buy a hundred thousand deposit or buy a hundred thousand dollars< dollars and use it all to buy T bills dollars and use it all to buy T bills you< you will still have ninety four thousand you will still have ninety four thousand dollars< dollars in buying power dollars in buying power and< and on top of that you need to know that and on top of that you need to know that there< there is a 25 fee for you to purchase there is a 25 fee for you to purchase this< this t-bus through tastytrade so if you this t-bus through tastytrade so if you think< think about it this is a way for you to think about it this is a way for you to actually< actually get your cash working much actually get your cash working much harder< harder for you harder for you so< so let's do some real quick calculations so let's do some real quick calculations down< down here so let's say for example you down here so let's say for example you just< just have a ten thousand dollars account just have a ten thousand dollars account now< now with interactive brokers if you have now with interactive brokers if you have ten< ten thousand dollars you know that it ten thousand dollars you know that it will< will generate zero percent interest will generate zero percent interest there's< there's nothing on that but if you were there's nothing on that but if you were to< to do it with tasty trade and you were to do it with tasty trade and you were to< to purchase this T bills then guess what to purchase this T bills then guess what you'll< you'll be able to earn this interest you'll be able to earn this interest right< right so how it works is this so let's right so how it works is this so let's say< say for example you buy this tbu but say for example you buy this tbu but you're< you're in September 23 for you're in September 23 for 966.

70< 966. 70 right so this will always be the 966.

70 right so this will always be the discount< discount price right when you purchase discount price right when you purchase the< the T bills there will be the face value the T bills there will be the face value which< which is the maturity amount which you which is the maturity amount which you get< get about maturity that means you get get about maturity that means you get back< back your cash plus interest and then back your cash plus interest and then you< you get the discount price so this is you get the discount price so this is the< the discounted price which you buy up the discounted price which you buy up front front front and< and then uh let's say for example you and then uh let's say for example you buy< buy 20 bills so there will be 9667 so buy 20 bills so there will be 9667 so that< that means the interest earned on that means the interest earned on maturity< maturity will be maturity will be 333< 333 dollars right and your cash balance 333 dollars right and your cash balance right< right now will be ten thousand dollars right now will be ten thousand dollars minus< minus the 967 minus the 25 fee to open minus the 967 minus the 25 fee to open up< up this trade right the transaction fee up this trade right the transaction fee and< and then now the final cash balance is and then now the final cash balance is 308< 308 dollars and from there now you have 308 dollars and from there now you have the< the option buying power because you put the option buying power because you put in in in 9667< 9667 to purchase these T bills so you 9667 to purchase these T bills so you will< will have 94 released to your option will have 94 released to your option buying< buying power and now on top of this 333 buying power and now on top of this 333 dollars< dollars of Interest which you will dollars of Interest which you will receive< receive and maturity you have this receive and maturity you have this amount< amount to play with to trade options now amount to play with to trade options now if< if I'm not wrong if you buy T bills if I'm not wrong if you buy T bills let's< let's say with any banks any financial let's say with any banks any financial institutions< institutions the amount which you buy institutions the amount which you buy into< into this T bills will be pretty much be into this T bills will be pretty much be locked< locked in there right you can't say that locked in there right you can't say that you< you know I want to buy T bills and then you know I want to buy T bills and then please< please give me you know 94 of it for me please give me you know 94 of it for me to< to do something else to do something else but< but with tastytrade you're able to use but with tastytrade you're able to use this< this to go and trade options this to go and trade options so< so now you might be wondering wow this so now you might be wondering wow this sounds< sounds a little bit too good to be true sounds a little bit too good to be true are< are there any risks with this are you are there any risks with this are you sure< sure that you know I can earn this sure that you know I can earn this interest< interest upon maturity is there any interest upon maturity is there any catch< catch so the thing is yes there are catch so the thing is yes there are risks< risks right I will put inverted Commerce risks right I will put inverted Commerce risks< risks but not in a sense whereby the risks but not in a sense whereby the risk< risk on your interest because this are risk on your interest because this are being< being guaranteed by the US government of being guaranteed by the US government of course< course there is the chance where the US course there is the chance where the US government< government might default on the bonds government might default on the bonds but< but what are the chances of that right but what are the chances of that right that's< that's why it's called the risk-free that's why it's called the risk-free rate< rate the governor will just keep rate the governor will just keep printing< printing money and printing money to pay printing money and printing money to pay out< out these interest if they need to right out these interest if they need to right so< so what are the risks associated with so what are the risks associated with this< this method well the risk associated this method well the risk associated basically< basically comes down to this part right basically comes down to this part right first< first of all you can see the cash first of all you can see the cash balance< balance which you remain is only 308 balance which you remain is only 308 dollars< dollars because you already used most of dollars because you already used most of it< it to actually put into T bills so the it to actually put into T bills so the thing< thing is that when you trade options thing is that when you trade options there< there will still be drawdowns for there will still be drawdowns for example< example if you put on a put spread let's example if you put on a put spread let's say< say you sell a put spread with a 30 say you sell a put spread with a 30 Delta< Delta that is about a 70 win rate which Delta that is about a 70 win rate which means< means to say 30 of the time roughly 30 means to say 30 of the time roughly 30 of< of the time you will actually lose money of the time you will actually lose money so< so if you lose money it will actually so if you lose money it will actually eat< eat into this cash balance so let's say eat into this cash balance so let's say for< for example on one of the trade you lose for example on one of the trade you lose 500< 500 if you lose 500 on that trade then 500 if you lose 500 on that trade then guess< guess what your cash balance will now guess what your cash. balance will now become< become negative so when it becomes become negative so when it becomes negative< negative also now you are on margin negative also now you are on margin because< because right now you are trading with because right now you are trading with the< the broker's money you are Brewing their the broker's money you are Brewing their money money money and< and when you are borrowing the money and when you are borrowing the money they< they will charge you a hefty margin rate they will charge you a hefty margin rate as< as you can see down here the rates down as you can see down here the rates down here< here are very high all the way from uh here are very high all the way from uh eight< eight to eleven percent so for the most eight to eleven percent so for the most part< part most people would lie somewhere part most people would lie somewhere around< around here so if you're only earning around here so if you're only earning about< about four percent on your interest down about four percent on your interest down here< here but then you're paying so much down here but then you're paying so much down here< here in terms of your margin rate then here in terms of your margin rate then in< in the end the interest might in the end in the end the interest might in the end be< be canceled out if you get two negative be canceled out if you get two negative in< in terms of your cash balance right so in terms of your cash balance right so remember< remember when we are training options remember when we are training options there< there will still be drawdown your there will still be drawdown your account< account size let's say for example your account size let's say for example your account< account here it's not a go straight up account here it's not a go straight up right< right that means it's not going to just right that means it's not going to just keep< keep making money all the way there will keep making money all the way there will be< be ups and downs ups and downs you'll be be ups and downs ups and downs you'll be able< able to face like draw down maybe for able to face like draw down maybe for some< some time then you'll come back up again some time then you'll come back up again right< right so for these times where they are right so for these times where they are drawn< drawn down you need to have sufficient drawn down you need to have sufficient cash< cash inside down there otherwise you'll cash inside down there otherwise you'll be< be eating into your margin right you'll be eating into your margin right you'll be< be tapping into the broker's money and be tapping into the broker's money and you'll< you'll be pretty much Brewing from them you'll be pretty much Brewing from them at< at such a hefty rate so instead of at such a hefty rate so instead of purchasing< purchasing the tea bills with the full purchasing the tea bills with the full account< account let's say the ten thousand account let's say the ten thousand dollars< dollars you may want to decide to buy a dollars you may want to decide to buy a portion< portion of it so maybe you want to put portion of it so maybe you want to put maybe< maybe 25 of it or 50 of it 75 this is maybe 25 of it or 50 of it 75 this is really< really up to your risk tolerance also really up to your risk tolerance also depends< depends on what kind of drawdown you depends on what kind of drawdown you think< think you anticipate right if you think think you anticipate right if you think there's< there's going to be a 50 kind of there's going to be a 50 kind of drawdown< drawdown on your account then you want drawdown on your account then you want to< to put up to 50 right into T bills so to put up to 50 right into T bills so you< you put 50 in the T bills at least those you put 50 in the T bills at least those 50< 50 is earning you that guaranteed 50 is earning you that guaranteed risk-free< risk-free interest and then on the other risk-free interest and then on the other hand< hand the other 50 you can use it to hand the other 50 you can use it to trade< trade options so that pretty much is the trade options so that pretty much is the only< only risk which you can have and that's only risk which you can have and that's the< the only one that I can think of right the only one that I can think of right other< other apart from the US government other apart from the US government defaulting< defaulting on your bonds other than for defaulting on your bonds other than for the< the most part this is a way for you to the most part this is a way for you to actually< actually earn interest on your account actually earn interest on your account now< now the next thing you might be now the next thing you might be wondering< wondering this sounds good how are you wondering this sounds good how are you able< able to actually purchase these t-bus able to actually purchase these t-bus through< through tastytrip well first of all you through tastytrip well first of all you need< need to know what are the T bills that need to know what are the T bills that you< you want to buy so I spoke with the you want to buy so I spoke with the tastytrade< tastytrade support team basically the tastytrade support team basically the trade< trade desk they will just ask you what Q trade desk they will just ask you what Q ship< ship you want to buy right so basically ship you want to buy right so basically QC< QC is the serial number right it tells QC is the

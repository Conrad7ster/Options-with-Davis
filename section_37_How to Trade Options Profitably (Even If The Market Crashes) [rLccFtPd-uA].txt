==============================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about how to we're going to be talking about how to trade< trade safely when the market is crashing trade safely when the market is crashing so< so I've had quite a number of people so I've had quite a number of people that< that have reached out to me recently that have reached out to me recently saying< saying you know Davis the market is saying you know Davis the market is crashing< crashing what should we do should we crashing what should we do should we still< still trade the market should we you still trade the market should we you know< know sit on the sidelines how do we know sit on the sidelines how do we trade< trade it can you create a video you know trade it can you create a video you know to< to guide us right so I'm going to be to guide us right so I'm going to be talking< talking about what to do during this talking about what to do during this uncertain< uncertain times so let us examine what uncertain times so let us examine what the< the market is doing in more detail so the market is doing in more detail so this< this is the S&amp;P 500 over here so if you this is the S&amp;P 500 over here so if you can< can see the market has roughly declined can see the market has roughly declined about< about 10% from the highs over here to about 10% from the highs over here to the< the lows somewhere down here right now the lows somewhere down here right now it< it has recovered a little bit so right it has recovered a little bit so right now< now it's somewhere over here but it's now it's somewhere over here but it's still< still a little bit uncertain right is still a little bit uncertain right is the< the market going to continue to go back the market going to continue to go back up< up or is it going to go even further up or is it going to go even further down< down so if you have been seeing the news down so if you have been seeing the news lately< lately then you will know that there are lately then you will know that there are mainly< mainly two things that's kind of driving mainly two things that's kind of driving this< this big move down right so the first this big move down right so the first one< one is the unemployment right numbers one is the unemployment right numbers that< that it came in a little bit higher than that it came in a little bit higher than what< what the analyst have expected and then what the analyst have expected and then secondly< secondly is the Yen carry trade the secondly is the Yen carry trade the unwinding< unwinding of the Yen carry trade so that unwinding of the Yen carry trade so that caused< caused kind of this very big move down caused kind of this very big move down now< now just only yesterday right as of this now just only yesterday right as of this recording< recording uh the unemployment claim just recording uh the unemployment claim just came< came out that it was actually lesser came out that it was actually lesser than< than what the analyst expected so that than what the analyst expected so that is< is why the market actually went up down is why the market actually went up down here< here so it recovered a little bit but here so it recovered a little bit but again< again still a little bit uncertain so again still a little bit uncertain so one< one thing to understand is that the one thing to understand is that the market< market has actually been going up for market has actually been going up for quite< quite some time right as you can see the quite some time right as you can see the market< market has been making all-time highs market has been making all-time highs for< for quite some time right now and it's for quite some time right now and it's only< only normal for the market to make one only normal for the market to make one of< of these pullbacks right and when it of these pullbacks right and when it pullbacks< pullbacks it can be a very you know pullbacks it can be a very you know shallow< shallow decline or it could be a steeper shallow decline or it could be a steeper decline< decline like this right this is only decline like this right this is only normal< normal now second L we can also look at normal now second L we can also look at statistics< statistics right numbers and historical statistics right numbers and historical pricing< pricing to kind of know you know roughly pricing to kind of know you know roughly what< what the market might do next now of what the market might do next now of course< course we do not want to predict it but course we do not want to predict it but there's< there's something that we can see based there's something that we can see based on< on historical prices to kind of give us on historical prices to kind of give us an< an idea on what to expect so one of the an idea on what to expect so one of the things< things that has happened just only you things that has happened just only you know< know at the beginning of the week is know at the beginning of the week is that< that there was a very huge Spike on the that there was a very huge Spike on the vix< vix to over 64 right as you can see the vix to over 64 right as you can see the market< market has been staying at around you market has been staying at around you know< know below 20s for the longest time know below 20s for the longest time right< right very low volatility environment right very low volatility environment and< and then all of a sudden a very huge and then all of a sudden a very huge Spike< Spike to above 60 so I came across a Spike to above 60 so I came across a very< very interesting study by the tasty very interesting study by the tasty trade< trade team whereby they analyze every trade team whereby they analyze every instance< instance where the Vic spiked above 60 instance where the Vic spiked above 60 over< over the past 25 years right so they over the past 25 years right so they found< found out that it approximately happened found out that it approximately happened about< about 50 times so based on this they about 50 times so based on this they analyze< analyze the past few times whenever the analyze the past few times whenever the vix< vix has gone past 60 what happens to the vix has gone past 60 what happens to the market< market later on so this is a very pretty market later on so this is a very pretty uh< uh interesting finding so you can see uh interesting finding so you can see that< that based on the findings they found that based on the findings they found out< out that a month later the market tends out that a month later the market tends to< to increase 65% of the time right so to increase 65% of the time right so this< this is mainly for the index ETFs right this is mainly for the index ETFs right so< so for spy so you can see that there is so for spy so you can see that there is generally< generally a greater probability of it generally a greater probability of it Rising< Rising one month later than it going Rising one month later than it going down< down now that is not to say that this down now that is not to say that this time< time it's going to be the 65% as well time it's going to be the 65% as well right< right that's still the 35% of the time right that's still the 35% of the time that< that the market can still go down so that the market can still go down so which< which is which well we have no idea and which is which well we have no idea and we< we do not want to guess right but at we do not want to guess right but at least< least we know that the probability is in least we know that the probability is in the< the favor of the market going up in a the favor of the market going up in a month< month later so as you can see down here month later so as you can see down here they< they did more studies into this and you they did more studies into this and you can< can just dive into the numbers in can just dive into the numbers in details< details on your own I'm not going to go details on your own I'm not going to go through< through here but you can see that you through here but you can see that you know< know at the end the percentage move in know at the end the percentage move in the< the S&amp;P 500 one month after whenever the the S&amp;P 500 one month after whenever the vix< vix have hit 60 usually is a positive vix have hit 60 usually is a positive number< number right so that's one thing to look number right so that's one thing to look at< at now with that said we don't want to at now with that said we don't want to predict< predict the market because we really predict the market because we really never< never know what's going to do but the never know what's going to do but the question< question is how do we trade safely in question is how do we trade safely in case< case the market continues to go down case the market continues to go down right< right so this is something that you right so this is something that you really< really need to know because you will really need to know because you will Face< Face Market crashes in your lifetime Face Market crashes in your lifetime right< right as especially if you plan to trade right as especially if you plan to trade for< for the next 10 20 years or more right for the next 10 20 years or more right Market< Market crashes is going to happen and Market crashes is going to happen and you< you need to know what to do when it you need to know what to do when it comes< comes so may not necessarily be now but comes so may not necessarily be now but previously< previously it was in 2020 2022 as well previously it was in 2020 2022 as well so< so how do you trade safely if it does so how do you trade safely if it does happen< happen again this time so first of all happen again this time so first of all this< this is the most important thing and this is the most important thing and that< that is to always lean on studies and that is to always lean on studies and statistics< statistics to make your trading statistics to make your trading decisions< decisions not your emotions so this is decisions not your emotions so this is one< one of the things whereby I see a lot of one of the things whereby I see a lot of people< people in the market do right whenever people in the market do right whenever there's< there's a market crash they Panic there's a market crash they Panic they're< they're not sure what to do they either they're not sure what to do they either hold< hold on to the trade for too long and hold on to the trade for too long and then< then they lose even more or they cut off then they lose even more or they cut off their< their trade a little bit too quickly and their trade a little bit too quickly and not< not let the trade work out on its own so not let the trade work out on its own so this< this is where you really need to lean on this is where you really need to lean on studies< studies and statistics because if you studies and statistics because if you think< think about it in our own life this is think about it in our own life this is how< how we also determine certain things or how we also determine certain things or how< how we make certain decisions right for how we make certain decisions right for example< example if you know that maybe a certain example if you know that maybe a certain food< food has a higher probability of giving food has a higher probability of giving you< you health benefits compared to another you health benefits compared to another product< product you might of course want to go product you might of course want to go for< for you know the first product and if for you know the first product and if you< you see that maybe another product has a you see that maybe another product has a higher< higher probability of giving you you higher probability of giving you you know< know problems to your health in future know problems to your health in future you< you probably want to avoid that right you probably want to avoid that right you< you do not base it on your emotions you do not base it on your emotions right< right we always have objective decision right we always have objective decision making< making so it's the same for trading as making so it's the same for trading as well< well so that is why we want to look to well so that is why we want to look to statistics< statistics and studies for us to plan statistics and studies for us to plan our< our trading decisions so as you can see our trading decisions so as you can see down< down here this is of the put spread on down here this is of the put spread on spy< spy so again another study done by the spy so again another study done by the tasty< tasty trade team whereby they just put tasty trade team whereby they just put on< on the put spread over and over again on the put spread over and over again over< over the course of a number of years over the course of a number of years right< right so as you can see down here the right so as you can see down here the studies< studies have been dated all the way back studies have been dated all the way back to< to 2006 and even all the way through to to 2006 and even all the way through to pandemic< pandemic so uh the number of years down pandemic so uh the number of years down here< here is over a decade so the study is here is over a decade so the study is pretty< pretty significant so what you notice is pretty significant so what you notice is that< that over the long term this strategy is that over the long term this strategy is still< still going to be profitable even though still going to be profitable even though there< there are Market crashes and they didn't there are Market crashes and they didn't even< even time the market all they did was even time the market all they did was just< just put on the P spread right once it's just put on the P spread right once it's time< time to exit they close it and then they time to exit they close it and then they put< put it on again right so this is a very put it on again right so this is a very continuous< continuous trade in the long term it continuous trade in the long term it worked< worked out so another strategy the short worked out so another strategy the short putut< putut again same. thing right they just putut again same thing right they just put< put on the trade over and over again in put on the trade over and over again in the< the long term is going to be profitable the long term is going to be profitable now< now of course that's not to say that now of course that's not to say that you're< you're going to be profitable in every you're going to be profitable in every trade< trade because clearly you can see that trade because clearly you can see that there< there are times where the market came there are times where the market came down< down right the p&amp;l has dropped but over down right the p&amp;l has dropped but over the< the long term it's going to be the long term it's going to be profitable< profitable again same thing down here profitable again same thing down here with< with the iron Condor right now later on with the iron Condor right now later on I'll< I'll be talking about the different I'll be talking about the different management< management style but you can see if you management style but you can see if you manage< manage the iron Condor on spy regardless manage the iron Condor on spy regardless whether< whether it's 21 DTE or if you hold it to whether it's 21 DTE or if you hold it to expiration< expiration overall it's still a profit expiration overall it's still a profit right< right over the number of years and same right over the number of years and same thing< thing as well for strangle right thing as well for strangle right although< although you have a very very big uh although you have a very very big uh down< down move as you can see down here down move as you can see down here during< during the financial crisis but if you during the financial crisis but if you continue< continue to just put it on over the long continue to just put it on over the long term< term you're still going to end up in a term you're still going to end up in a profit< profit again although it took a very profit again although it took a very long< long time so that is why again risk long time so that is why again risk management< management and trade management both are management and trade management both are very< very important you want to keep your very important you want to keep your position< position sizing small enough so that you position sizing small enough so that you know< know one trade does not blop your entire know one trade does not blop your entire account< account and this brings me to a very account and this brings me to a very important< important next point and that is to look important next point and that is to look at< at the next 100 trades in instead of at the next 100 trades in instead of just< just focusing on the next few trades so just focusing on the next few trades so a< a very important terminology you need to a very important terminology you need to understand< understand is What's called the law of understand is What's called the law of large< large numbers so the law of large large numbers so the law of large numbers< numbers just simply say that you know in numbers just simply say that you know in order< order for your Edge to play out you need order for your Edge to play out you need to< to have a very large sample size so as to have a very large sample size so as you< you can see over here this is another you can see over here this is another study< study done by the tasty trade team where study done by the tasty trade team where they< they examine a strategy that has roughly they examine a strategy that has roughly about< about 80% win rate so you notice that at about 80% win rate so you notice that at the< the start if you have only roughly about the start if you have only roughly about say< say 10 traes or so you can see that the say 10 traes or so you can see that the wind< wind rate can swing very wildly from wind rate can swing very wildly from somewhere< somewhere around 55% to 100% right so if somewhere around 55% to 100% right so if you< you put on maybe 5 to 10 trades of an you put on maybe 5 to 10 trades of an 80%< 80% win rate strategy if let's say for 80% win rate strategy if let's say for example< example you only have half of them that example you only have half of them that are< are winners and there are half are are winners and there are half are losers< losers you might be led to believe losers you might be led to believe saying< saying that hey this strategy you say saying that hey this strategy you say it's< it's 80% but it doesn't work right it's 80% but it doesn't work right because< because I only want five out of 10 times because I only want five out of 10 times well< well the answer is because you only put well the answer is because you only put on< on 10 times 10 trades on 10 times 10 trades that's< that's just too little it's like if you that's just too little it's like if you flip< flip a coin if you flip a coin say five flip a coin if you flip a coin say five times< times it's very possible that you get times it's very possible that you get all< all hits or all taals but does that mean all hits or all taals but does that mean that< that this coin is all the time only that this coin is all the time only going< going to show up hits all the time if going to show up hits all the time if you< you flip maybe 100 or maybe a thousand you flip maybe 100 or maybe a thousand times< times chances are not right so it's the times chances are not right so it's the same< same thing with your trading right now same thing with your trading right now on< on the other end you might be led to on the other end you might be led to believe< believe that if an 80% win rate you put believe that if an 80% win rate you put on< on five times and you win all the time on five times and you win all the time you< you may think that hey this strategy is you may think that hey this strategy is so< so great that you know I never lose so great that you know I never lose money< money and you start to increase your money and you start to increase your size< size and then when that big loss happen size and then when that big loss happen then< then you're going to lose everything then you're going to lose everything right< right so you need to understand that the right so you need to understand that the law< law of large numbers play out only when law of large numbers play out only when you< you have a lot of Trades going in so you have a lot of Trades going in so don't< don't just look at next few trades right don't just look at next few trades right I< I have a few people that have reached I have a few people that have reached out< out to me before say Davis I put on one out to me before say Davis I put on one of< of those put strategy you shared in your of those put strategy you shared in your YouTube< YouTube videos and it was a loss today YouTube videos and it was a loss today what's< what's happening why is there a loss what's happening why is there a loss so< so if you don't understand that you know so if you don't understand that you know you're< you're going to have some losses you're you're going to have some losses you're going< going to have losing streaks then I going to have losing streaks then I would< would say that options trading is not would say that options trading is not for< for you right because if you can't look for you right because if you can't look at< at the next 100 trades or more to at the next 100 trades or more to finally< finally determine you know the True finally determine you know the True Performance< Performance of your strategy then I Performance of your strategy then I would< would say that trading is not suitable would say that trading is not suitable for< for you right better to just park your for you right better to just park your money< money and you know fixed income money and you know fixed income securities< securities this way at least you don't securities this way at least you don't have< have to worry about losing so over here have to worry about losing so over here you< you can see is a trade sample of a 100 you can see is a trade sample of a 100 trades< trades right as you can see over here if trades right as you can see over here if you< you were to just basic off 10 trades you were to just basic off 10 trades maybe< maybe this first 10 trades down here you maybe this first 10 trades down here you could< could easily see that hey this whole could easily see that hey this whole strategy< strategy might be down maybe a little strategy might be down maybe a little bit< bit or break even and you might be led bit or break even and you might be led to< to believe hey this strategy doesn't to believe hey this strategy doesn't work< work I'm going to throw it away at the work I'm going to throw it away at the same< same time if you're a little bit unlucky same time if you're a little bit unlucky let's< let's say when you first started trading let's say when you first started trading you< you started trading when there are this you started trading when there are this losses< losses in a row right you incur six losses in a row right you incur six losses< losses in a row and then you're going to losses in a row and then you're going to say< say this strategy sucks it doesn't work say this strategy sucks it doesn't work Davis< Davis what's happening well if you were Davis what's happening well if you were to< to stop at just this six trades then to stop at just this six trades then guess< guess what you're going to miss out on guess what you're going to miss out on all< all the other trades that would have all the other trades that would have eventually< eventually put this whole strategy into eventually put this whole strategy into a< a positive so remember always look at a positive so remember always look at the< the next 100 trades not just the next the next 100 trades not just the next few< few trades next trade index ETS instead few trades next trade index ETS instead of< of individual stocks so most of the time of individual stocks so most of the time most< most of the people they get into trouble most of the people they get into trouble they< they lost a lot of money during this they lost a lot of money during this Market< Market crashes is usually because Market crashes is usually because they're< they're trading it on individual stocks they're trading it on individual stocks and< and the reason is because individual and the reason is because individual stocks< stocks tend to be much much more stocks tend to be much much more volatile< volatile than when you trade index ETFs volatile than when you trade index ETFs so< so you can see down here another study so you can see down here another study done< done by the tasty trade team so remember done by the tasty trade team so remember always< always lean on studies and statistics always lean on studies and statistics right< right you'll be seeing quite a number of right you'll be seeing quite a number of studies< studies and statistics in this video studies and statistics in this video I'll< I'll be sharing with you along the way I'll be sharing with you along the way so< so you can see over here that the study so you can see over here that the study shows< shows that the stocks movement is much shows that the stocks movement is much much< much greater than the index ETFs right much greater than the index ETFs right the< the index ETF the movement is much much the index ETF the movement is much much narrow< narrow and more of the time right you narrow and more of the time right you can< can see down here based on the can see down here based on the likelihood< likelihood it's going to stay within a likelihood it's going to stay within a narrow< narrow range so even during Market narrow range so even during Market crashes< crashes even like for example the recent crashes even like for example the recent decline< decline S&amp;P 500 has only dropped 10% but decline S&amp;P 500 has only dropped 10% but certain< certain stocks right have dropped much certain stocks right have dropped much much< much more so if you want to play it much more so if you want to play it safer< safer you don't want to see a huge draw safer you don't want to see a huge draw down< down in your portfolio then definitely down in your portfolio then definitely just< just stick with index ETF also just stick with index ETF also especially< especially if you're just starting out especially if you're just starting out now< now next as you can see on this table now next as you can see on this table down< down here uh the tasty trade team again down here uh the tasty trade team again have< have done more studies and Research into have done more studies and Research into understanding< understanding the differences between understanding the differences between ETFs< ETFs compared to individual stocks so ETFs compared to individual stocks so you< you can see down here in the green box you can see down here in the green box these< these are all ETFs and over here in the these are all ETFs and over here in the red< red box these are individual stocks so red box these are individual stocks so what< what they did is that they wanted to what they did is that they wanted to measure< measure what is the probability of loss measure what is the probability of loss exceeding< exceeding the buying power requirement exceeding the buying power requirement at< at expiration so basically when you put at expiration so basically when you put on< on an undefined risk strategy for on an undefined risk strategy for example< example a strangle you will see that example a strangle you will see that there's< there's this buying power requirement there's this buying power requirement that< that the broker will actually hold so that the broker will actually hold so this< this is the capital that the broker will this is the capital that the broker will actually< actually hold for you to place the trade actually hold for you to place the trade right< right so they wanted to see what's the right so they wanted to see what's the chances< chances of you losing more than this chances of you losing more than this initial< initial amount right so you can see over initial amount right so you can see over here< here for the index ETFs if you were to here for the index ETFs if you were to take< take a look at spy the chances of you take a look at spy the chances of you losing< losing more than the initial buying losing more than the initial buying power< power to put on the trade was only power to put on the trade was only 0. 9%< 0.

9% and the max loss as a multiple of 0. 9% and the max loss as a multiple of the< the buying power is 1.

6 right so for the buying power is 1. 6 right so for example< example if you put on the strangle on example if you put on the strangle on spy< spy let's say for example. is $88,000 spy let's say for example is $88,000 then< then the max loss at expiration the then the max loss at expiration the maximum< maximum is 1.

6 times of that right if maximum is 1. 6 times of that right if you< you will take a look at the rate box you will take a look at the rate box let's< let's say for example Amazon right you let's say. for example Amazon right you can< can see that Amazon the probability of can see that Amazon the probability of loss< loss exceeding the buying power loss exceeding the buying power requirement< requirement is 2.

6% so it's much higher requirement is 2. 6% so it's much higher than< than the Spy right about two and a half than the Spy right about two and a half times< times and you can see that the magnitude times and you can see that the magnitude of< of the loss is much bigger so let's say of the loss is much bigger so let's say for< for example for Amazon if you put on the for example for Amazon if you put on the strangle< strangle maybe it's about let's say strangle maybe it's about let's say $2,000< $2,000 so you're going to lose $6,000 $2,000 so you're going to lose $6,000 because< because it's three times of the initial because it's three times of the initial buying< buying power so that is why you know if buying power so that is why you know if you< you want to play it safe then stick to you want to play it safe then stick to the< the index ETFs next you want to position the index ETFs next you want to position size< size your trade small enough so that no size your trade small enough so that no single< single trade will wipe out your account single trade will wipe out your account and< and don't have more than 50% of your and don't have more than 50% of your Capital< Capital allocated at any one time so the Capital allocated at any one time so the biggest< biggest and best defense you have biggest and best defense you have whenever< whenever there's a very big sharp move whenever there's a very big sharp move in< in the market it's always just your in the market it's always just your position< position sizing up front if you position position sizing up front if you position size< size it small enough then no matter how size it small enough then no matter how big< big this move it won't take up a big big this move it won't take up a big chunk< chunk of your account so one of the big chunk of your account so one of the big problems< problems that most people face and also problems that most people face and also especially< especially for beginners when they start especially for beginners when they start trading< trading options is that they only look trading options is that they only look at< at the amount they want to make right so at the amount they want to make right so let's< let's say for example you put on the put let's say for example you put on the put spread< spread they will always look at the kind spread they will always look at the kind of< of Premium that they can receive and of Premium that they can receive and they< they determine their size based on how they determine their size based on how much< much they want to make so when you do much they want to make so when you do that< that you actually IGN in all the risk so that you actually IGN in all the risk so what< what happens is that when there's a big what happens is that when there's a big market< market crash especially when you put on market crash especially when you put on the< the put spread then you're going to find the put spread then you're going to find that< that one trade can easily wipe out your that one. trade can easily wipe out your account< account right at the same time you also account right at the same time you also want< want to ensure that your max allocation want to ensure that your max allocation of< of your total Capital does not go more of your total Capital does not go more than< than 50% right certain times you might than 50% right certain times you might want< want to push it slightly past that right want to push it slightly past that right According< According to some tasty trade studies According to some tasty trade studies they< they mentioned that maybe you could also they mentioned that maybe you could also push< push up to a maximum of around 70% but push up to a maximum of around 70% but as< as a guideline I will say 50% is very as a guideline I will say 50% is very good< good and you can see over here this is a good and you can see over here this is a table< table to give you a guideline of you table to give you a guideline of you know< know what's your allocation based on the know what's your allocation based on the vix< vix level so if you ad her to this no vix level so if you ad her to this no

your portfolio so this way< way you know wherever the market goes way you know wherever the market goes you< you do have some positions that can you do have some positions that can actually< actually capture the move now that is actually capture the move now that is not< not to say that all of them will profit not to say that all of them will profit all< all at the same time right they all all at the same time right they all profit< profit at different times what is profit at different times what is important< important to note is that over the long important to note is that over the long term< term all the strategies that you put on term all the strategies that you put on can< can become profitable so again this is can become profitable so again this is where< where you want to lean on statistics and where you want to lean on statistics and studies< studies so as you can see over here studies so as you can see over here right< right I shared with you previously in right I shared with you previously in the< the past few slides on this put spread the past few slides on this put spread on< on spy now you can see that crashes are on spy now you can see that crashes are normal< normal you can see that the put spread normal you can see that the put spread for< for this study down here has gone for this study down here has gone through< through two crashes right 2008 as well through two crashes right 2008 as well as< as in 2020 but in the long term the as in 2020 but in the long term the market< market still goes up so even though market still goes up so even though let's< let's say for example right now the let's say for example right now the market< market is crashing do you avoid entering market is crashing do you avoid entering the< the market or do you continue trading the market or do you continue trading well< well this is really a decision you have well this is really a decision you have to< to make because one thing is that you to make because one thing is that you never< never know what is the market going to never know what is the market going to do< do if if you knew the market is really do if if you knew the market is really going< going to crash then all you got to do is going to crash then all you got to do is just< just buy puts or just short the stock just buy puts or just short the stock the< the Market's going to go down and then the Market's going to go down and then you're< you're going to be in profit but the you're going to be in profit but the thing< thing is that we never know right thing is that we never know right because< because who knows this correction just because who knows this correction just for< for a short while and then after that for a short while and then after that market< market goes back up so what you want to market goes back up so what you want to do< do is just stick to your strategy and do is just stick to your strategy and continue< continue trading so as long as you know continue trading so as long as you know that< that you know if you put on a bullish that you know if you put on a bullish strategy< strategy in the long term is going to be strategy in the long term is going to be profitable< profitable just stick to it even though profitable just stick to it even though you< you have to sit through all those you have to sit through all those crashes< crashes because again guys losses will crashes because again guys losses will come< come I cannot emphasize this enough come I cannot emphasize this enough because< because a lot of people want to trade because a lot of people want to trade the< the markets avoiding losses again if you the markets avoiding losses again if you want< want to avoid losses don't trade options want to avoid losses don't trade options now< now as you can see over here this is now as you can see over here this is another< another statistic that's done by the another statistic that's done by the ttic< ttic trade team again over a number of ttic trade team again over a number of years< years they have examined this study on years they have examined this study on the< the put spread overall is going to be in the put spread overall is going to be in a< a profit right as you can see annual a profit right as you can see annual rooc< rooc is a positive same thing for rooc is a positive same thing for neutral< neutral strategy so for neutral strategy neutral strategy so for neutral strategy for< for example just the iron condo the iron for example just the iron condo the iron condo< condo again has has gone through crashes condo again has has gone through crashes based< based on this study right you can see in based on this study right you can see in 2008< 2008 and later on as well but in the 2008 and later on as well but in the long< long term still going to be positive long term still going to be positive again< again and again you can see in this again and again you can see in this table< table down here the average p&amp;l is a table down here the average p&amp;l is a positive< positive right the daily average p&amp;l as positive right the daily average p&amp;l as well< well is a positive that means all this well is a positive that means all this have< have already taken into account all the have already taken into account all the losses< losses right all the crashes even right losses right all the crashes even right because< because you can see there has been a because you can see there has been a number< number of times where the market had a number of times where the market had a very< very steep Decline and this study has very steep Decline and this study has examined< examined across all this time so when examined across all this time so when you< you you lean on this study you know that you you lean on this study you know that hey< hey in the long term your portfolio will hey in the long term your portfolio will still< still in the end be profitable and still in the end be profitable and finally< finally the bearish or what I call Semi finally the bearish or what I call Semi bearish< bearish strategy so bearish strategies bearish strategy so bearish strategies are< are basically strategies like for are basically strategies like for example< example the call spread right if we're example the call spread right if we're talking< talking about selling options so you can talking about selling options so you can see< see down here this is a study that's see down here this is a study that's done< done by the tasty trade team and they done by the tasty trade team and they examine< examine the C spread over you know a examine the C spread over you know a decade< decade as well. right as you can see from decade as well right as you can see from 2017< 2017 all the way to past 2017 and what 2017 all the way to past 2017 and what they< they found is that if you continuously they found is that if you continuously put< put on the C spread at best it's going put on the C spread at best it's going to< to be a break even uh for a $5 and $10 to be a break even uh for a $5 and $10 white< white credit spread a call Credit spread white credit spread a call Credit spread but< but if you do the $1 credit spread then but if you do the $1 credit spread then it's< it's going to be in a loss right so it's going to be in a loss right so that's< that's why you know avoid going for the that's why you know avoid going for the very< very narrow credit spreads so for this very narrow credit spreads so for this you< you can see that for the call spread you can see that for the call spread it's< it's generally Break Even or maybe a it's generally Break Even or maybe a slight< slight loss mainly because the market slight loss mainly because the market has< has kept going up so what I prefer has kept going up so what I prefer instead< instead is something What's called the instead is something What's called the semi-< semi- bearish strategy so this is semi- bearish strategy so this is something< something uh that's like the put ratio something uh that's like the put ratio spread< spread or the put broken wing butterfly spread or the put broken wing butterfly so< so as you can you can see down here so as you can you can see down here these< these are actual trades right that for these are actual trades right that for the< the most part of this especially at the the most part of this especially at the start< start this was during the 2022 bare start this was during the 2022 bare market< market right when the market has market right when the market has declined< declined this is where strategies like declined this is where strategies like the< the put ra spread and a put brok the put ra spread and a put brok goinging< goinging butterfly actually does pretty goinging butterfly actually does pretty well< well because by Nature it's defensive well because by Nature it's defensive right< right you want the market to come down right you want the market to come down in< in order for you to actually reach a in order for you to actually reach a profit< profit zone so the idea here about profit zone so the idea here about diversifying< diversifying your trading strategies is diversifying your trading strategies is that< that we never know what the market is that we never know what the market is going< going to do right we know in the long going to do right we know in the long term< term it's going to go up but over the term it's going to go up but over the next< next month we have no idea what it's next month we have no idea what it's going< going to do that's why we put on the going to do that's why we put on the different< different strategies now next a very different strategies now next a very important< important one and that is to exit your important one and that is to exit your trades< trades at 21 DTE the latest especially trades at 21 DTE the latest especially for< for lers right so this applies to most for lers right so this applies to most strategies< strategies like for example the put strategies like for example the put spread< spread down here so this study as you spread down here so this study as you can< can see done by the TC trade team again can see done by the TC trade team again again< again it spent across over a decade and again it spent across over a decade and you< you can see that when they compare this you can see that when they compare this put< put spread when you exit at expiration put spread when you exit at expiration versus< versus you exit you know at 21 DTE you versus you exit you know at 21 DTE you you< you can find that the average loss is you can find that the average loss is actually< actually much more controlled when you actually much more controlled when you exit< exit it early right if you exit at 21 exit it early right if you exit at 21 DTE< DTE you can see that the average loss is DTE you can see that the average loss is roughly< roughly around roughly around $77< $77 and if you exit expiration it's much $77 and if you exit expiration it's much much< much bigger so during such times right much bigger so during such times right especially< especially when the market is really especially when the market is really making< making a big move down right in Market making a big move down right in Market crashes< crashes this is not the time whereby you crashes this is not the time whereby you hope< hope that the market eventually come hope that the market eventually come back< back up and then you will lose lesser back up and then you will lose lesser statistics< statistics have already shown if you statistics have already shown if you stick< stick to this mechanically You Exit 21 stick to this mechanically You Exit 21 DTE< DTE even though right it could be a loss DTE even though right it could be a loss now< now compared to you know sometimes you now compared to you know sometimes you hold< hold to expiration you find that the hold to expiration you find that the market< market eventually comes back up and then market eventually comes back up and then you< you profit in the long term exiting at you profit in the long term exiting at 21< 21 DT will still give you a much more 21 DT will still give you a much more control< control average loss and also in the end control average loss and also in the end if< if you take a look at the annual Roc if you take a look at the annual Roc your< your return is actually much higher your return is actually much higher right< right so again you want to base your right so again you want to base your trading< trading decisions on studies and trading decisions on studies and statistics< statistics not your emotions when you statistics not your emotions when you Lan< Lan it on emotions this is where a lot Lan it on emotions this is where a lot of< of people get into trouble so over here of people get into trouble so over here another< another study done by The Taste trade another study done by The Taste trade team< team as you can see over here what they team as you can see over here what they did< did is that they examine what if you did is that they examine what if you exited< exited an undefined risk strategy at exited an undefined risk strategy at expiration< expiration versus 21 DTE right so as you expiration versus 21 DTE right so as you can< can see over here the top table shows of can see over here the top table shows of expiration< expiration so let's take a look at spy expiration so let's take a look at spy right< right so for spy the probabilty of loss right so for spy the probabilty of loss exceeding< exceeding the buying power requirement exceeding the buying power requirement at< at expiration you can see at expiration you can see 0.

9%< 0. 9% but if you had exited it at 21 DTE 0.

9% but if you had exited it at 21 DTE you< you will see that the probability of you will see that the probability of loss< loss exceeding the BP is actually 0% loss exceeding the BP is actually 0% which< which means to say for example if you which means to say for example if you put< put on the stranger on spy let's say for put on the stranger on spy let's say for example< example it's 8K right what this study is example it's 8K right what this study is just< just saying that if you exit a 21 DTE it. just saying that if you exit a 21 DTE it will< will never reach this Max loss of will never reach this Max loss of $88,000< $88,000 it will always be less than that $88,000 it will always be less than that now< now if you take a look at stocks as well now if you take a look at stocks as well right< right Amazon Amazon if you hold to right Amazon Amazon if you hold to expiration< expiration the the probability of loss expiration the the probability of loss exceeding< exceeding this initial buying power is exceeding this initial buying power is 2. 6%< 2.

6% but if you were to exit at 21 DTE 2. 6% but if you were to exit at. 21 DTE this< this number drops down to 1.

#### Topic 1

1% so the this number drops down to 1. 1% so the chances< chances of you actually exceeding it is. chances of you actually exceeding it is only only only 1.

1%< 1. 1% and the other thing is also what is 1.

1% and the other thing is also what is the< the max loss as a multiple of BPR you the max loss as a multiple of BPR you. can< can see that for spy right if you hold can see that for spy right if you hold the< the expiration the max loss will be 1. 6 the expiration the max loss will be 1.

6 times< times of this amount right the BPR they times of this amount right the BPR they put< put up for the. trade but for 21 DTE if put up for the trade but for 21 DTE if exited< exited 1 DTE is only 0. 6 times so that exited 1 DTE is only 0.

6 times so that means< means your loss again is much lesser means your loss again is much lesser than< than the initial buying power so here's than the initial buying power so here's another< another study on the iron condo as well another study on the iron condo as well right< right the probability of reaching the right the probability of reaching the max< max loss uh holding to expiration versus max loss uh holding to expiration versus exiting< exiting at 21 DTE so at the top this exiting at 21 DTE so at the top this table< table down here shows if you exit table down here shows if you exit expiration< expiration you can see that for the long expiration you can see that for the long delta< delta wing that means if your long Wings. delta wing that means if your long Wings right< right so for example this is the iron right so for example this is the iron Condor< Condor so what they're saying is that Condor so what they're saying is that this< this long Wing is 13 Delta so this two this long Wing is 13 Delta so this two strikes< strikes down here you find the 13 Delta strikes down here you find the 13 Delta ones< ones okay so both sides 13 Delta so you ones okay so both sides 13 Delta so you can< can see that the probability of reaching can see that the probability of reaching the< the max loss if you have a 13 delta wing the max loss if you have a 13 delta wing at< at expiration is at expiration is 6. 4%< 6.

4% but if you were to exit at 21 DTE 6. 4% but if you were to exit at 21 DTE then< then the chances of you actually. having then the chances of you actually having this< this Max loss before 21 DTE is 0.

4% so this Max loss before 21 DTE is 0. 4% so as< as you can see it dramatically drops so as you can see it dramatically drops so same< same thing let's say for example if your same thing. let's say for example if your wing< wing down here is of five Delta you can wing down here is of five Delta you can see< see that expiration is 1.

2% and if you see that expiration is 1. 2% and if you exit< exit at 21 DT the chances is 0% so this exit at 21 DT the chances is 0% so this is< is why we always want to lean on is why we always want to lean on statistics< statistics and studies to base our statistics and studies to base our trading< trading decisions so this way you're trading decisions so this way you're able< able to trade much more objectively and able to trade much more objectively and not< not worry when the market is making a not worry when the market is making a big< big move because you already know what big move because you already know what your< your max loss is and you know that just your max loss is and you know that just based< based on this study if you have a five based on this study if you have a five delta< delta wing you know your max loss is not delta wing you know your max loss is not going< going to be hit if you construct it going to be hit if you construct it properly< properly so this brings me to my next properly so this brings me to my next very< very very very important point and I very very very important point and I would< would say it's the most important point would say it's the most important point of< of all my slides down here and that is of all my slides down here and that is to< to always have an Exit Plan before you to always have an Exit Plan before you enter< enter into the trade not after you put enter into the trade not after you put it< it on the trade and then you wait until it on the trade and then you wait until the< the market crashes then you think about the market crashes then you think about what< what to do then right because by that what to do then right because by that time< time it will be way too late so back in time it will be way too late so back in 2022< 2022 that was the time where the market 2022 that was the time where the market started< started to get into a bare Market I had started to get into a bare Market I had a< a lot of people that actually reach out a lot of people that actually reach out to< to me and ask me you know Davis my to me and ask me you know Davis my position< position is in a huge loss right most of position is in a huge loss right most of the< the time it's where the positions is the time it's where the positions is very< very deep in the money and they reach very deep in the money and they reach out< out to me to ask me what to do right out to me to ask me what to do right it's< it's never before right if you have to it's never before right if you have to ask< ask somebody to manage your trade for ask somebody to manage your trade for you< you then you shouldn't be in the trade you then you shouldn't be in the trade in< in the first place because you should in the first place because you should know< know full well what to do before you know full well what to do before you place< place the trade so always have your exit place the trade so always have your exit plan< plan ready especially you already know plan ready especially you already know what's< what's your worst case scenario so what's your worst case scenario so here's< here's a very important thing you need here's a very important thing you need to< to understand right while we cannot to understand right while we cannot control< control what the market does control what the market does we< we can control what we do right and we we can control what we do right and we already< already know in advance that the market already know in advance that the market can< can only go a few places right it can go can only go a few places right it can go all< all the way up it can go sideways and it all the way up it can go sideways and it can< can go all the way down so when you can go all the way down so when you already< already know all this uh possible already know all this uh possible movements< movements in the market in advance you movements in the market in advance you should< should already plan for them right plan should already plan for them right plan for< for them based on different scenarios for them based on different scenarios right< right like for example scenario a right like for example scenario a scenario< scenario B scenario C right plan for all scenario B scenario C right plan for all these< these different movements so that that these different movements so that that when< when the market actually Bo to either of when the market actually Bo to either of these< these places you just have to look at these places you just have to look at your< your plan and then execute it right this your plan and then execute it right this way< way you. don't have to worry right way you don't have to worry right especially< especially if you already know your especially if you already know your worst< worst case scenario and then you accept worst case scenario and then you accept it< it then you can have a very peaceful it then you can have a very peaceful sleep< sleep at night right too many times you sleep at night right too many times you hear< hear people say that they feel so hear people say that they feel so stressed< stressed in the middle of the night stressed in the middle of the night cannot< cannot sleep because they have a cannot sleep because they have a position< position on if you have position on position on if you have position on where< where you worry number one is because where you worry number one is because your< your position is way too big so what you your position is way too big so what you should< should do reduce your size number two is should do reduce your size number two is because< because you didn't plan out your exit because you didn't plan out your exit scenarios< scenarios if you plan your exit scenarios if you plan your exit scenarios< scenarios then nothing the market does scenarios then nothing the market does should< should surprise you because again you should surprise you because again you really< really know what the market can do you really know what the market can do you plan< plan it in advance all you got to do is plan it in advance all you got to do is execute< execute it your objective so I'm going execute it your objective so I'm going to< to end off this with a quote that I saw to end off this with a quote that I saw many< many many many years ago when I first many many many years ago when I first started< started trading and it has been my started trading and it has been my guiding< guiding principle since then to help me guiding principle since then to help me really< really navigate the market safely really navigate the market safely especially< especially during very uncertain times especially during very uncertain times like< like right now right especially if the like

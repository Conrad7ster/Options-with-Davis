### Generate Monthly Income With The IRON CONDOR [IPMzDPKpK_k]
==============================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty So today we're going all right alrighty So today we're going to< to be talking about generating monthly to be talking about generating monthly income< income with the iron Condor so what income with the iron Condor so what exactly< exactly is the iron Condor well the iron exactly is the iron Condor well the iron Condor< Condor is a high probability neutral Condor is a high probability neutral defined< defined risk option strategy that aims defined risk option strategy that aims to< to capture profits if the market stays to capture profits if the market stays within< within a certain range so it consists of within a certain range so it consists of two< two credit spreads you have the short two credit spreads you have the short put< put spread which is a bullish option put spread which is a bullish option strategy< strategy and you have a short call strategy and you have a short call spread< spread which is a bearish option spread which is a bearish option strategy< strategy so when you combine these two strategy so when you combine these two together< together what you have is a strategy together what you have is a strategy that< that seeks to try and capture you know that seeks to try and capture you know the< the profits if the market stays within a the profits if the market stays within a given< given range so as you can see down here given range so as you can see down here this< this is the risk profile of the iron this is the risk profile of the iron condor< condor so on the left hand side you can condor so on the left hand side you can see< see there's a shot put and a long put so see there's a shot put and a long put so this< this is what you call the shot put this is what you call the shot put spread< spread right it's also what you call a spread right it's also what you call a bull< bull put spread so this is a bully bull put spread so this is a bully strategy< strategy where you want the market to go strategy where you want the market to go up< up above your strike prices right so you up above your strike prices right so you have< have the long put option as a way to have the long put option as a way to define< define your risk which means to say you define your risk which means to say you have< have protected your downside right so in have protected your downside right so in case< case if case if um< um well this normally comes like there um well this normally comes like there is< is another pandemic the market suddenly is another pandemic the market suddenly crashes< crashes you don't really have to worry crashes you don't really have to worry because< because if the market goes all the way because if the market goes all the way down< down you have already kept your loss so down you have already kept your loss so if< if the market goes all the way to a if the market goes all the way to a hundred< hundred dollars it doesn't matter hundred dollars it doesn't matter because< because you already have the max risk because you already have the max risk which< which is down here so this is actually which is down here so this is actually pretty< pretty good because if you unable to pretty good because if you unable to monitor< monitor your positions that often you monitor your positions that often you can't< can't always stay in front of your you can't always stay in front of your you know< know trading platform whenever the know trading platform whenever the market< market is open then you want to put on market is open then you want to put on uh< uh option strategy something like this uh option strategy something like this because< because in this way because in this way you< you have already defined your wrist up you have already defined your wrist up front< front you already know what is the worst front you already know what is the worst loss< loss that you can have right instead of loss that you can have right instead of putting< putting on a naked shot put right if you putting on a naked shot put right if you put< put on a naked shot put instead of a put on a naked shot put instead of a cash< cash secure output where you do not cash secure output where you do not actually< actually have the money to fulfill the actually have the money to fulfill the 100< 100 shares of the line stock if the 100 shares of the line stock if the market< market really crashes like the pandemic market really crashes like the pandemic you're< you're going to lose a lot of money so you're going to lose a lot of money so this< this is where you want to have this uh this is where you want to have this uh protection< protection this long put protection this long put to< to lock in the maximum loss that you can to lock in the maximum loss that you can lose< lose in case the market goes down so now lose in case the market goes down so now on< on the other hand you have what you call on the other hand you have what you call the< the bear call spread so the bear call the bear call spread so the bear call spread< spread is a bearish spread so it is a spread is a bearish spread so it is a short< short call spread where you have a short short call spread where you have a short call< call option call option and< and then you also protect your upside and then you also protect your upside risk< risk in case the market rallies all the risk in case the market rallies all the way< way up way up with< with this long call option here so again with this long call option here so again as< as you can see your wrist is defined at as you can see your wrist is defined at the< the end down here and this is a high the end down here and this is a high probability< probability strategy basically you're probability strategy basically you're looking< looking at somewhere around 60 percent looking at somewhere around 60 percent uh< uh winner uh winner so< so if the market stays within this range so if the market stays within this range you< you can see from here this is the you can see from here this is the break-even< break-even point so if the market stays break-even point so if the market stays within< within this range within this range by< by expiration then you're going to seek by expiration then you're going to seek to< to capture the maximum profit which is to capture the maximum profit which is usually< usually around 25 to 30 percent of the usually around 25 to 30 percent of the width< width of the strike which is something width of the strike which is something I'm< I'm going to explain later on so you're I'm going to explain later on so you're going< going to collect roughly about 25 to 30 going to collect roughly about 25 to 30 percent< percent about the width of this iron percent about the width of this iron Condor< Condor Wings which you have created from Condor Wings which you have created from this< this point to at this point okay so why this point to at this point okay so why do< do you want to trade the iron Condor do you want to trade the iron Condor well< well first off it's because it's a high well first off it's because it's a high probability< probability option strategy that means probability option strategy that means you're< you're going to win more often than you're going to win more often than you're< you're going to lose and it's also great you're going to lose and it's also great if< if you don't want to pick a bullish or if you don't want to pick a bullish or bearish< bearish direction right so if you're not bearish direction right so if you're not that< that great at reading the charts or you that great at reading the charts or you don't< don't have time to take a look at the don't have time to take a look at the chart< chart all you have to do is just put on chart all you have to do is just put on an< an iron Condor and say that you know if an iron Condor and say that you know if the< the market stays within a certain range the market stays within a certain range then< then you're going to make money right then you're going to make money right especially< especially this range is going to be especially this range is going to be pretty< pretty big as well and this iron Condor pretty big as well and this iron Condor actually< actually captures the fact that the actually captures the fact that the market< market tends to stay within the one market tends to stay within the one standard< standard division range most of the time standard division range most of the time so< so the one standard division range so the one standard division range basically< basically just depicts that the market basically just depicts that the market is< is going to stay within a certain range is going to stay within a certain range 68< 68 percent of the time so this is 68 percent of the time so this is usually< usually how we pick our strikes for our usually how we pick our strikes for our iron< iron Condor this is how we set it up iron Condor this is how we set it up basically< basically what we do is we want to pick basically what we do is we want to pick the< the short strike roughly around the edge the short strike roughly around the edge of< of the one standard division Mark so we of the one standard division Mark so we are< are most likely going to sell a shot are most likely going to sell a shot option< option down here short put down here and option down here short put down here and a< a short call on the other side all right a short call on the other side all right so< so this is how we pick our strikes to so this is how we pick our strikes to capture< capture the one standard deviation range capture the one standard deviation range so< so this is a study done by the folks at so this is a study done by the folks at tasty< tasty trade right so if you don't know tasty trade right so if you don't know who< who they are I suggest that you go ahead who they are I suggest that you go ahead and< and go to the website and just take a and go to the website and just take a look< look right they did a lot of research a look right they did a lot of research a lot< lot of study on option strategies lot of study on option strategies especially< especially selling premium right premium especially selling premium right premium selling< selling strategies so they did a very selling strategies so they did a very thorough< thorough and in-depth research and study thorough and in-depth research and study over< over a number of years and I believe over a number of years and I believe since< since all the way from 2005 since all the way from 2005 to< to try and understand a little bit to try and understand a little bit better< better to see how often the market better to see how often the market actually< actually stays within this one standard actually stays within this one standard deviation< deviation range so it depicts or it says deviation range so it depicts or it says that< that the market should stay within this that the market should stay within this range< range 68 of the time so there are two range 68 of the time so there are two ways< ways to identify this one standard ways to identify this one standard deviation< deviation range right so you can use it deviation range right so you can use it according< according to the expected move formula according to the expected move formula which< which I'll show you how to find that which I'll show you how to find that later< later on and you can also base it on 16 later on and you can also base it on 16 Delta< Delta options so 16 Delta options if you Delta options so 16 Delta options if you have< have it on both sides this will have it on both sides this will basically< basically capture the one standard basically capture the one standard deviation< deviation range as well so the financial deviation range as well so the financial model< model says that it should be inside here model says that it should be inside here 68< 68 of time but take a look at the actual 68 of time but take a look at the actual occurrences< occurrences right so they did a test to occurrences right so they did a test to see< see how often does it actually stay see how often does it actually stay inside< inside here is it actually 68 and what inside here is it actually 68 and what they< they found is that it actually stays they found is that it actually stays within< within this range more often than what within this range more often than what the< the one standard deviation range depicts the one standard deviation range depicts it< it to be so as you can see if you do it it to be so as you can see if you do it based< based on expected move formula it based on expected move formula it actually< actually stays 85 percent of the time actually stays 85 percent of the time instead< instead of 68 of time and if you will do instead of 68 of time and if you will do the< the 16 Delta options that means both the 16 Delta options that means both sides< sides is 16 Delta it actually stays sides is 16 Delta it actually stays within< within the range 71 of the time so it within the range 71 of the time so it means< means to say that this one standard means to say that this one standard deviation< deviation range is uh not exactly as deviation range is uh not exactly as accurate< accurate as what it actually happens in accurate as what it actually happens in the< the market right so it tends to actually the market right so it tends to actually understate< understate the number of times it stays understate the number of times it stays in< in this given range now they also did in this given range now they also did another< another study so this study is on spy another study so this study is on spy so< so as you can see down here on the left so as you can see down here on the left hand< hand column down here this is the actual hand column down here this is the actual realized< realized move that it's being made in realized move that it's being made in the< the market compared to the expected move the market compared to the expected move so< so this is based on the financial model so this is based on the financial model all< all the calculations that they think all the calculations that they think that< that the market is going to move before that the market is going to move before it< it actually moves and then this is after it actually moves and then this is after it< it happens so as you can see regardless it happens so as you can see regardless of< of the volatility they notice that the of the volatility they notice that the actual< actual move the realized move is always actual move the realized move is always lesser< lesser than the expected move that is lesser than the expected move that is why< why we are able to make money with this why we are able to make money. with this iron< iron Condor because iron Condor it iron Condor because iron Condor it states< states that the market should stay states that the market should stay within< within this range 68 of time but the within this range 68 of time but the truth< truth is that it actually stays inside truth is that it actually stays inside here< here longer than 68 of time so if you here longer than 68 of time so if you can< can see the table before you can see can see the table before you can see that< that if you use the expected move that if you use the expected move formula formula formula it< it stays within here 85 percent of the it stays within here 85 percent of the time< time so this means that the implied time so this means that the implied volatility< volatility is always overstating the volatility is always overstating the actual< actual volatility and again the folks at actual volatility and again the folks at tastytrade< tastytrade they did a lot of research tastytrade they did a lot of research and< and started into this that shows that and started into this that shows that the< the implied volatility is always the implied volatility is always overstating< overstating what the actual volatility overstating what the actual volatility is< is that is why you have this difference is that is why you have this difference this< this Gap in what the theoretical this Gap in what the theoretical percentage< percentage should be that the market percentage should be that the market stays< stays within this range compared to the stays within this range compared to the actual actual actual move< move right the actual percentage that move right the actual percentage that the< the market stays in within this range the market stays in within this range now< now the final reason you want to trade now the final reason you want to trade the< the iron Condor is because it is the iron Condor is because it is consistently< consistently profitable over a long consistently profitable over a long period< period of time so again as you can see period of time so again as you can see this< this graph down here this is a study this graph down here this is a study done< done by the folks at tastytrade again done by the folks at tastytrade again again< again they have a lot of research on again they have a lot of research on this< this so you can see this research is on this so you can see this research is on the< the 20 Delta ion condo with 10 white the 20 Delta ion condo with 10 white rings< rings so you can see that it is very rings so you can see that it is very consistently< consistently profitable over the long consistently profitable over the long term< term especially since 2005 and even gone term especially since 2005 and even gone through< through the financial crisis around 2008 through the financial crisis around 2008 right< right you have the financial crisis at right you have the financial crisis at 2008< 2008 and then around 2018 this is 2008 and then around 2018 this is roughly< roughly around the time where there's roughly around the time where there's the< the trade War so as you can see it the trade War so as you can see it didn't< didn't do as well but overall in the didn't do as well but overall in the long< long term long term it< it is a profitable strategy mainly it is a profitable strategy mainly because< because most of the time the market because most of the time the market stays< stays within the one standard revision stays within the one standard revision longer< longer or more often than what the one longer or more often than what the one standard< standard division actually depicts so as standard division actually depicts so as you< you can see down here there are actually you can see down here there are actually two< two lines down here one it says 21 DTE two lines down here one it says 21 DTE and< and the other one expiration so and the other one expiration so basically< basically what it is is that the this basically what it is is that the this graph< graph shows that graph shows that you< you basically take off your iron condor you basically take off your iron condor you< you close it regardless if it's a profit you close it regardless if it's a profit or< or a loss when there's 21 days to go so or a loss when there's 21 days to go so let's< let's say for example if you place it at let's say for example if you place it at 45< 45 DTE this is where you open up the 45 DTE this is where you open up the iron< iron Condor trade and then when it comes iron Condor trade and then when it comes down< down all the way to 21 DTE you just take down all the way to 21 DTE you just take it< it off right you take it off regardless it off right you take it off regardless if< if it's a win or a loss whereas for this if it's a win or a loss whereas for this great< great line down here basically what great line down here basically what they're< they're saying is that if you put it on they're saying is that if you put it on at< at 45 days basically you just hold it on at 45 days basically you just hold it on all< all the way until it expires so if you all the way until it expires so if you would< would compare the two you can see that would compare the two you can see that the< the 21 DTE when you manage it at 21 DTE the 21 DTE when you manage it at 21 DTE performance< performance is much more consistent performance is much more consistent right< right and the reason for this is because right and the reason for this is because they< they found out that when the option they found out that when the option strategy< strategy especially short option strategy especially short option strategies< strategies when it goes past the 21 days strategies when it goes past the 21 days to< to expiration mark this is where the to expiration mark this is where the gamma< gamma starts to pick up now gamma is a gamma starts to pick up now gamma is a risk< risk for us short premium sellers risk for us short premium sellers because< because it starts to increase as it gets because it starts to increase as it gets closer< closer to expiration date that means closer to expiration date that means that< that right any losses will become that right any losses will become increased< increased if we have just a small move increased if we have just a small move that< that moves against us so that is why he that moves against us so that is why he came< came up with this model the folks at came up with this model the folks at tastytrade< tastytrade came up this model that if tastytrade came up this model that if they< they took it off at 21 DT you can see they took it off at 21 DT you can see that< that the performance is much more that the performance is much more consistent< consistent so there's going to be much consistent so there's going to be much more< more volatility control more volatility control which< which means to say that your p l is not which means to say that your p l is not going< going to fluctuate as much right so if I going to fluctuate as much right so if I were< were to go back to this p l graph you were to go back to this p l graph you can< can see that this purple line down here can see that this purple line down here right< right this will show you how your p l right this will show you how your p l will< will look like will look like depending< depending on how many days left there is depending on how many days left there is to< to expiration so when you first put on to expiration so when you first put on the< the iron Condor you're going to see this the iron Condor you're going to see this purple< purple line so on the day itself as you purple line so on the day itself as you can< can see if the market is to just go was can see if the market is to just go was to< to go down here to go down here you're< you're going to lose this amount of you're going to lose this amount of money< money right from this point down here so money right from this point down here so as< as the days go by as you get closer and as the days go by as you get closer and closer< closer to expiration this graph all closer to expiration this graph all right< right this curve down here this line right this curve down here this line will< will slowly adjust itself all the way will slowly adjust itself all the way until< until it becomes this green line that until it becomes this green line that means< means it's going to get more steeper and means it's going to get more steeper and steeper steeper steeper so< so as you can see down here let's see it so as you can see down here let's see it starts< starts to go more and more closer to starts to go more and more closer to expiration< expiration date so it can start to expiration date so it can start to become< become something like this right an become something like this right an expiration< expiration as as it gets closer to expiration as as it gets closer to expiration< expiration so as you can see down here expiration so as you can see down here if< if you started off with this point if you started off with this point anywhere< anywhere within this range at 21 days anywhere within this range at 21 days expression< expression you could be profitable but expression you could be profitable but let's< let's see if the market is at this point let's see if the market is at this point down< down here right at this point down here down here right at this point down here at< at 21 DT you can see that the curve down at 21 DT you can see that the curve down here< here this slope down here becomes more here this slope down here becomes more steeper< steeper that means as the market starts steeper that means as the market starts to< to go up it starts to hurt you a little to go up it starts to hurt you a little bit< bit more because you're going to lose bit more because you're going to lose more< more than when it did at the start right more than when it did at the start right so< so as it gets even closer the expiration so as it gets even closer the expiration date< date you can see this will start to fit date you can see this will start to fit even< even more to the even more to the exploration< exploration risk profile which is the exploration risk profile which is the green< green line so as you can see if it gets green line so as you can see if it gets closer< closer to expiration date this curve closer to expiration date this curve down< down here gets even steeper so if your down here gets even steeper so if your your< your current price is here your current price is here let's< let's say there's maybe 10 days left to let's say there's maybe 10 days left to expiration expiration expiration any< any move down here to the right hand any move down here to the right hand side< side as it goes up you're going to lose side as it goes up you're going to lose much< much more much more compared< compared again when it's at 21 DT or compared again when it's at 21 DT or compact< compact when there's zero or when you compact when there's zero or when you first< first put it on so that is why this first put it on so that is why this financial< financial study or this study that they financial study or this study that they put< put on shows that if you click on at 21 put on shows that if you click on at 21 DTE< DTE your p l volatility swing is going DTE your p l volatility swing is going to< to be much lesser and the performance to be much lesser and the performance actually< actually is going to be much more actually is going to be much more Superior< Superior by the way if this video has Superior by the way if this video has been< been helpful to you so far I'd been helpful to you so far I'd appreciate< appreciate it if you hit the thumbs up appreciate it if you hit the thumbs up button< button and also subscribe to my channel button and also subscribe to my channel so< so I can create more videos like this so I can create more videos like this for< for you in the future okay back to the for you in the future okay back to the video< video alright so let's get into some video alright so let's get into some trade< trade mechanics right so for you to put trade mechanics right so for you to put on< on this iron Condor this is just a on this iron Condor this is just a guideline< guideline now you can adjust this guideline now you can adjust this however< however you want this is not something however you want this is not something that< that is set in stone but this is just a that is set in stone but this is just a general< general guideline you can tweak it a general guideline you can tweak it a little< little bit based on your own preference little bit based on your own preference so< so generally for this your expiration we so generally for this your expiration we want< want it somewhere closest to 45 days to want it somewhere closest to 45 days to expiration< expiration so if you can't find one expiration so if you can't find one expression< expression there is 45 on the dot right expression there is 45 on the dot right you< you can just find anywhere from 30 to 60 you can just find anywhere from 30 to 60 that< that is fine now for the one standard that is fine now for the one standard deviation< deviation in range like this where you deviation in range like this where you ideally< ideally want to put the short strikes of ideally want to put the short strikes of your< your iron condor right you want to your iron condor right you want to either< either use the expected move or use the either use the expected move or use the Delta< Delta version right so I'm going to show Delta version right so I'm going to show you< you both so for the expected move you both so for the expected move basically< basically you can find this in your basically you can find this in your options< options platform so this is the think of options platform so this is the think of Swing< Swing platform if you open up your Swing platform if you open up your option< option chain you will see on the right option chain you will see on the right hand< hand side you will see this percentage hand side you will see this percentage as< as well as this number on the far right as well as this number on the far right side< side so this percentage is the implied side so this percentage is the implied volatility< volatility right this is the implied volatility right this is the implied volatility< volatility at that point in time volatility at that point in time and< and this is telling you the expected and this is telling you the expected move< move that means you can move roughly move that means you can move roughly about about about 25. 48< 25.

48 points right so what you want to 25. 48 points right so what you want to do< do is to use this 25.

48 points and plus do is to use this 25. 48 points and plus and< and minus based on the current price so and minus based on the current price so for< for example if the current price right for example if the current price right now< now is 400 so to calculate where you're now is 400 so to calculate where you're going< going to put the short strike for the going to put the short strike for the put< put option you're just going to take 400 put option you're just going to take 400 minus< minus of this number down here and then minus of this number down here and then on< on the call side you're going to take on the call side you're going to take 400< 400 plus 25 so this way you actually 400 plus 25 so this way you actually have< have a very equidistant iron Condor have a very equidistant iron Condor where< where they are both pretty much the same where they are both pretty much the same length< length now if you were to use the Delta length now if you were to use the Delta strikes< strikes you roughly want to use strikes you roughly want to use somewhere< somewhere around 16 Deltas right 16 somewhere around 16 Deltas right 16 Delta< Delta is the one standard deviation but Delta is the one standard deviation but you< you want to go somewhere 15 to 25 that's you want to go somewhere 15 to 25 that's fine< fine as well if you go right the higher fine as well if you go right the higher the< the Delta you're going to collect more the Delta you're going to collect more premium< premium the lower the Delta you're going premium the lower the Delta you're going to< to collect lesser premium there's always to collect lesser premium there's always a< a trade-off right the trade-off is that a trade-off right the trade-off is that right< right with 25 Delta you have a higher right with 25 Delta you have a higher premium< premium but you're going to have a premium but you're going to have a lesser< lesser win rate a lower probability of lesser win rate a lower probability of profit< profit but with 15 Delta you can gonna profit but with 15 Delta you can gonna have< have a higher probability of profit but have a higher probability of profit but you're< you're going to collect lesser premium you're going to collect lesser premium which< which means to say your maximum risk is which means to say your maximum risk is going< going to be higher compared to the one going to be higher compared to the one with< with the higher Delta short strikes with the higher Delta short strikes right< right so these are the two different right so these are the two different ways< ways that you can calculate the range of ways that you can calculate the range of your< your iron Condor now the difference your iron Condor now the difference between< between both of them is that this Delta between both of them is that this Delta tends< tends to take in to consideration the tends to take in to consideration the skill< skill of the options for the underlying skill of the options for the underlying stock< stock right so for example if the stock stock right so for example if the stock let's< let's say this is spy you actually have let's say this is spy you actually have put< put skill that means they actually price put skill that means they actually price the< the put option more expensive than the the put option more expensive than the call< call option that is because they take call option that is because they take into< into the expected the expectations of into the expected the expectations of the< the market right so for the Spy they the market right so for the Spy they price< price it more expensive for the put side price it more expensive for the put side so< so you will notice that when you find so you will notice that when you find around< around the 15 to 25 Delta for the put around the 15 to 25 Delta for the put option< option you'll find that it actually is option you'll find that it actually is lower lower lower compared< compared to the site on the call option compared to the site on the call option right< right basically if you were to find the right basically if you were to find the let's< let's say you're going to find both same let's say you're going to find both same Delta< Delta let's say you find the 20 Delta Delta let's say you find the 20 Delta right< right mostly you're going to find one right mostly you're going to find one that< that is going to be somewhere like this that is going to be somewhere like this right< right your shot put strike is going to right your shot put strike is going to be< be somewhere lower be somewhere lower right< right further away from the current right further away from the current market< market and then your call side is going market and then your call side is going to< to be slightly nearer to the current to be slightly nearer to the current market< market so this way you can see that this market so this way you can see that this is< is the skill so maybe from here all the is the skill so maybe from here all the way< way to here way to here right< right maybe it's about 35 points right maybe it's about 35 points and< and then from this point to. down here and then from this point to down here it's< it's going to be 25 points right it's going to be 25 points right so< so compared to if you were to do an so compared to if you were to do an equidistance< equidistance maybe the equidistance will equidistance maybe the equidistance will be< and< and then 30 points to the other side and then 30 points to the other side right< right so this is the difference between right so this is the difference between the< the two calculations now there's no one the two calculations now there's no one that< that is better than the other it comes that is better than the other it comes down< down to your own expectation so that is down to your own expectation so that is why< why there is this table down here right why there is this table down here right so< so this table down here this expected so this table down here this expected move< move formula it says the actual move formula it says the actual occurrences< occurrences Within the expected move is occurrences Within the expected move is 85< 85 so basically what they're referring 85 so basically what they're referring to< to is this expected move down here and to is this expected move down here and this< this 16 Delta option is based on the this 16 Delta option is based on the delta delta delta right< right of the option of the short strike right of the option of the short strike so< so it's generally based on the skill so so it's generally based on the skill so you< you have a call skew you will find that you have a call skew you will find that your< your iron Condor is more shifted towards your iron Condor is more shifted towards a< a bullish bias all right so you want to a bullish bias all right so you want to find< find one that is suitable for you for me find one that is suitable for you for me I< I prefer the equidistant one so I would I prefer the equidistant one so I would generally< generally always go for this one all generally always go for this one all right< right next you want to collect around 25 right next you want to collect around 25 to< to 35 premium on the width of the Wings to 35 premium on the width of the Wings so< so for example if you have a wing of so for example if you have a wing of five< five dollars that means the short strike five dollars that means the short strike distance< distance to the long strike is five distance to the long strike is five dollars< dollars right so you want to collect dollars right so you want to collect roughly< roughly one dollar fifty cents and for roughly one dollar fifty cents and for the< the ten dollar white Rings you want to the ten dollar white Rings you want to collect< collect roughly around three dollars collect roughly around three dollars again< again this is just a guideline again this is just a guideline now< now the position sizing you want to make now the position sizing you want to make this< this roughly around one to five percent this roughly around one to five percent of< of your Capital right so for example if of your Capital right so for example if you< you have a ten thousand dollars account you have a ten thousand dollars account and< and let's say five percent is going to and let's say five percent is going to be< be five hundred dollars that means you be five hundred dollars that means you want< want to put on something of a five want to put on something of a five dollar< dollar Wing right for each trade so this dollar Wing right for each trade so this way< way you can really manage your risk well way you can really manage your risk well so< so no one single trade is going to take so no one single trade is going to take a< a large chunk of your capital in case a large chunk of your capital in case the< the market goes against you right if you the market goes against you right if you have< have a bigger size account let's say you have a bigger size account let's say you have< have a hundred thousand dollars then you have a hundred thousand dollars then you can< can go for one percent right the bigger can go for one percent right the bigger the< the account the smaller you want each the account the smaller you want each trade< trade to be next is trade management so trade to be next is trade management so trade< trade management as we have really seen trade management as we have really seen down< down here down here so< so the study shows that 21 DTE is more so the study shows that 21 DTE is more effective< effective than if you were told to effective than if you were told to expiration< expiration so for uh managing it you expiration so for uh managing it you there's< there's two ways you can do it you can there's two ways you can do it you can either< either just close it out at 21 DT and either just close it out at 21 DT and then< then put it on again or you can choose then put it on again or you can choose to< to close at the 50 of Premium collected to close at the 50 of Premium collected so< so if you collected 1.

50 so you want to so if you collected 1. 50 so you want to call< call you want to close it out roughly call you want to close it out roughly around< around 75 cents so they have also done a around 75 cents so they have also done a study< study on this that if you were to close study on this that if you were to close it< it out at 50 of the premium collected it out at 50 of the premium collected it's< it's also even more I mean it is more it's also even more I mean it is more effective< effective still compared to only to effective still compared to only to expiration< expiration so either one would be expiration so either one would be equipped< equipped or you can do a combination of equipped or you can do a combination of both< both which is what I do that means I both which is what I do that means I give< give the trade roughly 21 days to work give the trade roughly 21 days to work out< out right 21 days to work out to see if out right 21 days to work out to see if I< I can get right uh close to 50 if I can I can get right uh close to 50 if I can get< get close to 50 I'll take it out if it get close to 50 I'll take it out if it doesn't< doesn't reach close to 50 percent doesn't reach close to 50 percent I< I want to see if it's inside this Wings I want to see if it's inside this Wings down< down here if it's inside this uh there's down here if it's inside this uh there's a< a profit Zone a profit Zone then< then I'll just hold on to it until it then I'll just hold on to it until it hits< hits either side of my Breakeven point hits either side of my Breakeven point if< if it hits the break-even point then I'm if it hits the break-even point then I'm just< just gonna get out right if it's outside just gonna get out right if it's outside of< of the profit Zone at 21 DTE around this of the profit Zone at 21 DTE around this price< price down here I'm just going to cut price down here I'm just going to cut loss< loss right I'm just going to take off loss right I'm just going to take off the< the trade so anyway from here to here the trade so anyway from here to here and< and anywhere from here to here as long and anywhere from here to here as long as< as it's outside of the 21 DTE model that as it's outside of the 21 DTE model that means< means it's below 21 DT I'm just going to means it's below 21 DT I'm just going to close< close it up for a loss next is close it up for a loss next is adjustment< adjustment if one side is Bridge all adjustment if one side is Bridge all right< right let me just remove all this messy right let me just remove all this messy drawing< drawing down here so you can see drawing down here so you can see now< now this adjustment is optional right now this adjustment is optional right you< you do not have to do it if you don't you do not have to do it if you don't want< want to generally I do not adjust and want to generally I do not adjust and again< again the folks at tasty trade they have again the folks at tasty trade they have done< done a lot of research and they found done a lot of research and they found that< that if you were to to try and manage it that if you were to to try and manage it that< that means you want to roll down the the that means you want to roll down the the wings< wings or you want to shift this down if wings or you want to shift this down if you< you get tested they found that it's not you get tested they found that it's not as< as effective as if you were to just put as effective as. if you were to just put the< the original thread on and just leave it the original thread on and just leave it as< as it is right and just manage it either as it is right and just manage it either at< at 21 GT or at 50 profit because they at 21 GT or at 50 profit because they found< found that if you were to manage it found that if you were to manage it right< right you kind of change your risk right you kind of change your risk profile< profile so the whole idea is that this profile so the whole idea is that this is< is actually already a defined risk is actually already a defined risk strategy< strategy that means your risk has strategy that means your risk has already< already been defined on both ends you already been defined on both ends you really< really know exactly what's the maximum really know exactly what's the maximum You're< You're Gonna Lose You're Gonna Lose compared< compared to if you're going to put on a compared to if you're going to put on a short< short strangle where you do not have short strangle where you do not have these< these Wings down here there's no these Wings down here there's no protection< protection so if the market crashes protection so if the market crashes you're< you're going to lose a lot right but you're going to lose a lot right but that's< that's not the case for iron Condor that's not the case for iron Condor because< because your wrist has already been kept because your wrist has already been kept so< so that is why that they say that so that is why that they say that there's< there's no need to actually adjust if it there's no need to actually adjust if it gets< gets breached but you could if you want gets breached but you could if you want to< to so basically the two ways you can do to so basically the two ways you can do it< it is to roll down the untested side so it is to roll down the untested side so let's< let's say for example this is the let's say for example this is the current< current market price and the market goes current market price and the market goes down< down here so it breaches your short down here so it breaches your short strike< strike on the put side strike on the put side so< so what you want to do is that you can so what you want to do is that you can actually< actually shift this site down here this actually shift this site down here this call< call spread you can shift it down maybe call spread you can shift it down maybe you< you can shift it to somewhere down here you can shift it to somewhere down here so< so now you're new risk profile will look so now you're new risk profile will look something< something like this so when you roll it something like this so when you roll it down down down the< the call side you're going to collect a the call side you're going to collect a small< small premium right it's still going to small premium right it's still going to be< be a credit you're going to receive be a credit you're going to receive something< something but it's not going to be a lot something but it's not going to be a lot so< so you're going to receive something so you're going to receive something like< like maybe 15 cents so let's say if your like maybe 15 cents so let's say if your original< original risk is uh sorry your original original risk is uh sorry your original credit< credit is a dollar fifty cents if you're credit is a dollar fifty cents if you're going< going to roll this down when the market going to roll this down when the market breaches< breaches this put strike then you're breaches this put strike then you're just< just going to collect an additional just going to collect an additional let's< let's say 15 cents so now your total let's say 15 cents so now your total credit< credit is going to be 1.

65 cents right credit is going to be 1. 65 cents right and< and it's not going to be that much it and it's not going to be that much it doesn't< doesn't contribute that much but what doesn't contribute that much but what you< you have also effectively done is that you have also effectively done is that you< you have now reduced your profit zone you have now reduced your profit zone right< right as you can see your profit zone right as you can see your profit zone now< now becomes smaller compared to the now becomes smaller compared to the original< original risk profile so what happens is original risk profile so what happens is that< that if the market suddenly bounces back that if the market suddenly bounces back up< up again and it goes past this strike up again and it goes past this strike suddenly< suddenly you're going to have a tough suddenly you're going to have a tough time< time managing this right because you're time managing this right because you're actually< actually going to be in a profit if you actually going to be in a profit if you held< held on to the original uh strike prices held on to the original uh strike prices because< because you have shifted it down we kind because you have shifted it down we kind of< of whip slot yourself but then of course of whip slot yourself but then of course this< this is if it comes up right if it this is if it comes up right if it continues< continues to go down or if it stays continues to go down or if it stays somewhere< somewhere around this range down here somewhere around this range down here then< then shifting down would actually be a then shifting down would actually be a good< good move right because you reduce your good move right because you reduce your risk< risk right you collect more premium risk right you collect more premium and< and in this case you'll be better off if and in this case you'll be better off if you're< you're at road down so again this comes you're at road down so again this comes down< down to your judgment as a Trader so the down to your judgment as a Trader so the other< other thing is you can also roll down other thing is you can also roll down and< and out the untested side right you can and out the untested side right you can roll< roll down out both actually so that roll down out both actually so that means< means you roll this down and then you means you roll this down and then you roll< roll both of them out right that is if roll both of them out right that is if there< there is less than 21 days left if there is less than 21 days left if there's< there's still roughly around 30 days or there's still roughly around 30 days or 40< 40 days left then all you want to do is 40 days left then all you want to do is just< just roll it down next is to roll the just roll it down next is to roll the whole< whole spread out the whole iron counter whole spread out the whole iron counter out< out in time if you can get a credit now out in time if you can get a credit now let< let me just remove all this again now let me just remove all this again now most< most of the time you're not going to get most of the time you're not going to get a< a credit by rolling out if the iron a credit by rolling out if the iron Condor< Condor or rather if the price have Condor or rather if the price have breached< breached into your short strike right so breached into your short strike right so it< it really depends on exactly how much it really depends on exactly how much time< time there is left and exactly how far time there is left and exactly how far it< it has breached the short strike but it has breached the short strike but basically< basically if it has reached all the way basically if it has reached all the way past< past even your long strike then it's not past even your long strike then it's not going< going to be possible for you to roll going to be possible for you to roll this< this whole spread out for a credit right this whole spread out for a credit right because because because this< this is definitely going to be a debit this is definitely going to be a debit if< if you're going to roll it out and if you're going to roll it out and you're< you're not going to receive much credit you're not going to receive much credit for< for rolling this because this is super for rolling this because this is super far< far out of the money right. so the only far out of the money right so the only time< time you want to roll out the whole time you want to roll out the whole thing< thing is if at 21 DTE let's say there's thing is if at 21 DTE let's say there's 21< 21 days left and the market is somewhere 21 days left and the market is somewhere around< around here right close to either one of around here right close to either one of your< your strikes or baby down here right your strikes or baby down here right either< either one of this point at a time now either one of this point at a time now at< at 21 DTE if your uh iron Condor or at 21 DTE if your uh iron Condor or rather< rather if the price is at the edge of rather if the price is at the edge of the< the short strikes chances are that the short strikes chances are that you're< you're still not going to make money you're still not going to make money right< right because of this curve it's going right because of this curve it's going to< to be probably something like this to be probably something like this right< right so as you can see at this point of right so as you can see at this point of time< time you're still going to be in a loss time you're still going to be in a loss but< but the thing is that it is still in the but the thing is that it is still in the profit< profit zone right so because it's still profit zone right so because it's still in< in the profit Zone that means your short in the profit Zone that means your short strike< strike has not been breached strike has not been breached you< you can still roll it out for a credit you can still roll it out for a credit so< so again this only comes down if it's so again this only comes down if it's close< close to 31 DTE all right so what I want close to 31 DTE all right so what I want to< to do now is I want to head on to the to do now is I want to head on to the trading< trading platform at think of stream and trading platform at think of stream and I'm< I'm going to show you how to construct I'm going to show you how to construct your< your iron Condor all right so we are at your iron Condor all right so we are at the< the think of Swing platform so let's the think of Swing platform so let's take< take a look at how you will construct take a look at how you will construct the< the iron Condor on Amazon right so the the iron Condor on Amazon right so the first< first thing you want to do is to look at first thing you want to do is to look at your< your calendar month right so is there 45 your calendar month right so is there 45 days< days left so this is 42 around there so days left so this is 42 around there so this< this is pretty good so next thing you this is pretty good so next thing you want< want to do is to choose your short want to do is to choose your short strike< strike so to choose your soft strikes strike so to choose your soft strikes again< again there are two ways you can either again there are two ways you can either look< look at the Delta so this is the Delta look at the Delta so this is the Delta you< you can look for the 16 Delta on this you can look for the 16 Delta on this side< side and also the 16 Delta on this side side and also the 16 Delta on this side or< or you can use the expected move formula or you can use the expected move formula right< right down here so all you have to do is right down here so all you have to do is just< just take out your trusty calculator so just take out your trusty calculator so we're< we're going to take out our calculator we're going to take out our calculator and< and then we want to see what's the and then we want to see what's the current< current price so the current price one current price so the current price one two< two nine let me just uh route it up to two nine let me just uh route it up to 130< 130 to make it easy and then we want to 130 to make it easy and then we want to minus< minus off the expected move for the minus off the expected move for the downside< downside to see what's our short put downside to see what's our short put strike< strike so this is around 14.

8 let's run strike so this is around 14. 8 let's run it< it off to 15 points so if roughly 115 so it off to 15 points so if roughly 115 so we< we want the 115 short strike on the put we want the 115 short strike on the put side<. side and let's take a look at the call side and let's take a look at the call side< side so the call side again you take one side so the call side again you take one three< three zero and you add 15.

so you're three zero and you add 15. so you're gonna< gonna have one four five so our strikes gonna have one four five so our strikes it's< it's gonna be one four five and one one it's gonna be one four five and one one five< five so what you want to do is you right five so what you want to do is you right click< click and you click analyze sell trade click and you click analyze sell trade and< and you go down to iron Condor so you and you go down to iron Condor so you can< can see it's going to populate your can see it's going to populate your strikes< strikes so the short strikes for the put strikes so the short strikes for the put option< option has already been set up right so option has already been set up right so 115< 115 110 five dollar White Wings perfect 115 110 five dollar White Wings perfect now< now we want to go over to the call side now we want to go over to the call side so< so what we want is one four five right so what we want is one four five right so< so one four five so one four five we< we want to change this to 145 so we go we want to change this to 145 so we go all< all the way down to 145 and then we want all the way down to 145 and then we want to< to have the wings five dollar wide so to have the wings five dollar wide so that< that is one hundred and fifty dollars that is one hundred and fifty dollars right< right so as you can see we are right so as you can see we are collecting< collecting a dollar and 42 cents so collecting a. dollar and 42 cents so that's< that's roughly uh close to 150 almost 30 that's roughly uh close to 150 almost 30 percent percent percent of< of the width of our condo iron Corner of the width of our condo iron Corner which< which is five dollar wide so this is the which is five dollar wide so this is the first< first way you can construct your iron first way you can construct your iron Condor< Condor now the next way is to take a Condor now the next way is to take a look< look at the Delta so if you take a look look at the Delta so if you take a look at< at Delta you want to find one that is at Delta you want to find one that is the< the closest to 16 Delta so let's compare the closest to 16 Delta so let's compare both< both of them and see what's the both of them and see what's the difference< difference right on the risk profile so difference right on the risk profile so let< let me just pull this up right so we let me just pull this up right so we want< want to go somewhere around 15 to 20 want to go somewhere around 15 to 20 deltas deltas deltas now< now if you would go to the Lesser Delta now if you would go to the Lesser Delta now< now you're going to receive lesser now you're going to receive lesser premium< premium for this and let's say 16 Delta premium for this and let's say 16 Delta down< down here let's let's just try and down here let's let's just try and construct< construct one and see how it looks like construct one and see how it looks like so< so it says 147.

25 now I don't want to go so it says 147. 25 now I don't want to go for< for this kind of a weird strikes because for this kind of a weird strikes because it's< it's it's going to be very odd right it's it's going to be very odd right we're< we're going to be very hard for you to we're going to be very hard for you to find< find five dollars white later on of this find five dollars white later on of this so< so I'd rather just go for the rounded so I'd rather just go for the rounded strikes< strikes the well-rounded strikes which strikes the well-rounded strikes which multiple< multiple of five points so the closest multiple of five points so the closest will< will be around 20 Delta so 15 25 Deltas will be around 20 Delta so 15 25 Deltas I'll< I'll go for 145 so as you can see it's I'll go for 145 so as you can see it's the< the same right let's see if we go for the same right let's see if we go for the< the 16 Delta strike see what can we go the 16 Delta strike see what can we go so< so I'll go down so this is what I'll so I'll go down so this is what I'll take< take a look at so the next one I'll go take a look at so the next one I'll go is< is one five zero so that's a multiple of is one five zero so that's a multiple of five< five now this is too far away this is 13 five now this is too far away this is 13 Deltas< Deltas right 13 Delta is a little bit Deltas right 13 Delta is a little bit too< too far away you're not going to collect too far away you're not going to collect enough< enough premium so I won't go for that so enough premium so I won't go for that so it's< it's going to stick to 145 on the call it's going to stick to 145 on the call side< side and what about on the shot put side side and what about on the shot put side on< on shop outside the closest is going to on shop outside the closest is going to be< be 18 deltas be 18 deltas so< so there you go right so there actually so there you go right so there actually isn't< isn't any change by using the Deltas isn't any change by using the Deltas compared< compared to using this expected move so compared to using this expected move so we're< we're going to stick with this and we're we're going to stick with this and we're going< going to stay with this and take a look going to stay with this and take a look at< at the wrist profile all right so this at the wrist profile all right so this is< is the risk profile now on the on this is the risk profile now on the on this box< box down here you can see this is where box down here you can see this is where you< you can adjust the dates to take a look you can adjust the dates to take a look at< at the p l graph at any given point in at the p l graph at any given point in time< time so let's go to today time so let's go to today so< so as you can see down here this is so as you can see down here this is where< where the p l graph looks like today where the p l graph looks like today right< right this is how it looks like so if I right this is how it looks like so if I was< was to use this uh lines down here to was to use this uh lines down here to Mark< Mark the break-even point you can take a Mark the break-even point you can take a look< look at our probability or profit as you look at our probability or profit as you can< can see is right on Mark 68 so this is can see is right on Mark 68 so this is one< one standard division right at the same one standard division right at the same time< time you take a look at the box at the time you take a look at the box at the background< background you can see this is a shaded background you can see this is a shaded gray< gray box at the background this shows gray box at the background this shows the< the one standard deviation range right the one standard deviation range right you< you can see it's slightly to the right you can see it's slightly to the right hand< hand side right but it's pretty much the hand side right but it's pretty much the same< same right so the market theoretically same right so the market theoretically is< is going to stay within this range is going to stay within this range between< between 68 percent of time now as we between 68 percent of time now as we have< have seen in the statistics already we have seen in the statistics already we know< know that it's going to stay actually know that it's going to stay actually longer< longer than 68 I mean rather it's going longer than 68 I mean rather it's going to< to stay more often in this range to stay more often in this range than< than 68 right so from here on what you than 68 right so from here on what you want< want to do is take a look at the want to do is take a look at the different< different p l curve right at a different different p l curve right at a different date< date so remember the studies which I've date so remember the studies which I've showed< showed you it shows that you want to showed you it shows that you want to take< take it off at 21 DTE so let's go all take it off at 21 DTE so let's go all the< the way to 21 DT as we can see that the the way to 21 DT as we can see that the expiration< expiration date is on the 21st of expiration date is on the 21st of October< October so when there's 21 days to October so when there's 21 days to expression< expression wrap that's around 30th expression wrap that's around 30th right< right or maybe even the first so on the right or maybe even the first so on the first< first of October you can see this is first of October you can see this is where< where your Curve will look like right where your Curve will look like right now< now so as you can see it becomes steeper now so as you can see it becomes steeper so< so it becomes even more steeper all so it becomes even more steeper all right< right just take a look at this curve right just take a look at this curve this< this slope down here you can see that it this slope down here you can see that it will< will become steeper as this go by you will become steeper as this go by you can< can see it becomes steeper and steeper can see it becomes steeper and steeper you< you can see that that's because of the you can see that that's because of the effect< effect of gamma so effect of gamma so that< that is why the Theory comes or rather that is why the Theory comes or rather the< the Studies have shown that if you take the Studies have shown that if you take off< off at 21 DTE you're going to have a off at 21 DTE you're going to have a lesser< lesser volatile p l right so here's how lesser volatile p l right so here's how you< you might want to manage it so basically you might want to manage it so basically for< for me what I want to do is that I will for me what I want to do is that I will wait< wait until there's 21 days left wait until there's 21 days left so< so let's go to the first of October so so let's go to the first of October so when< when there's 21 days left let's say for when there's 21 days left let's say for example< example it stays anywhere in within this example it stays anywhere in within this range< range now there's two things you can do range now there's two things you can do either< either you can just take it off down either you can just take it off down here< here and I put on a new Iron Condor or here and I put on a new Iron Condor or you< you could wait for it to reach the 50 you could wait for it to reach the 50 mark< mark because in the end it's still mark because in the end it's still inside< inside this profit zone right so how inside this profit zone right so how long< long will it take to get to the 50 Mark long will it take to get to the 50 Mark so< so we have already collected so we have already collected. 142< 142 up front 142 up front for< for the premium so roughly half of that for the premium so roughly half of that will< will be 70 right so if the market was to will be 70 right so if the market was to go< go all the way to where it was when we go all the way to where it was when we first< first put it on you will have your 50 first put it on you will have your 50 but< but you can see that as days go by right but you can see that as days go by right it< it will go closer and closer towards it will go closer and closer towards this< this uh expiration risk profile so that this uh expiration risk profile so that means< means that anywhere from this point down means that anywhere from this point down here< here you can see that this purple line here you can see that this purple line you< you can see it says the piano at the you can see it says the piano at the point< point in time so now 50 profit will be point in time so now 50 profit will be somewhere< somewhere here 70 to 70 so you can shift somewhere here 70 to 70 so you can shift this< this all the way here this all the way here all< all the way to somewhere here all right all the way to somewhere here all right so< so that means any time in point in time so that means any time in point in time if< if the market just shifts into this zone if the market just shifts into this zone right< right it may be here and then it moves right it may be here and then it moves inside< inside this Zone you're gonna just take inside this Zone you're gonna just take profit< profit right so this is uh if you take profit right so this is uh if you take off< off at 50 now if at 21 DTE let's go back off at 50 now if at 21 DTE let's go back to< to here again if you see that it's to here again if you see that it's currently< currently at a loss right down here it's currently at a loss right down here it's at< at 48 loss again two things you can do at 48 loss again two things you can do you< you can take off for the loss play for you can take off for the loss play for the< the statistics which I've shown you just the statistics which I've shown you just now now now and< and I just put on new trade or you can and I just put on new trade or you can just< just hold on to see whether it actually just hold on to see whether it actually uh< uh profits because you can know you uh profits because you can know you notice< notice that there is positive Theta notice that there is positive Theta that's< that's working for you down here because that's working for you down here because as< as each days go past you can see that as each days go past you can see that anywhere< anywhere that is from The break-even anywhere that is from The break-even Zone< Zone in within this break even Zone your Zone in within this break even Zone your p< p l curve is actually going to gravitate p l curve is actually going to gravitate closer< closer and closer upwards right that closer and closer upwards right that means< means you're actually going to get make means you're actually going to get make uh< uh profits right so if you were to take uh profits right so if you were to take a< a look at this p l down here it says on a look at this p l down here it says on the< the left hand side you're losing 48 the left hand side you're losing 48 Dollars< Dollars around 48 all right 47 now you Dollars around 48 all right 47 now you see< see what happens if I increase the days see what happens if I increase the days you< you see as the days go by you're losing you see as the days go by you're losing lesser< lesser and lesser and lesser right so lesser and lesser and lesser right so this< this is this is in< in the event let's say the market in the event let's say the market doesn't< doesn't move at all so as days go past doesn't move at all so as days go past it< it right the Theta is going to work in it right the Theta is going to work in your< your favor it's going to keep pushing your favor it's going to keep pushing you< you out the the profitability until to you out the the profitability until to the< the point that you can even reach the the point that you can even reach the profit< profit Zone up here profit Zone up here so< so you could choose to manage it that so you could choose to manage it that when< when it reaches 21 DTE and is still when it reaches 21 DTE and is still within< within this profit Zone you're still within this profit Zone you're still going< going to hold on to it right until it going to hold on to it right until it finally< finally exceeds this uh break-even point finally exceeds this uh break-even point so< so that means once it goes past this so that means once it goes past this break-even< break-even point starting from one one break-even point starting from one one three< three point five eight and Below now three point five eight and Below now this< this is where I will consider taking it this is where I will consider taking it off< off because right now you are outside off because right now you are outside the< the profit Zone which means to say as the profit Zone which means to say as you< you are outside the profit Zone let's you are outside the profit Zone let's say< say if you are at this point down here say if you are at this point down here this< this is where your Theta flips over and this is where your Theta flips over and becomes< becomes negative that means that as days becomes negative that means that as days go< go by you're losing more and more money go by you're losing more and more money so< so if you take a look at the p l down so if you take a look at the p l down here< here you see at this point in time here you see at this point in time you're< you're losing one one eight now as days you're losing one one eight now as days go< go by you can see this 118 go by you can see this 118 starts< starts to increase the loss your loss starts to increase the loss your loss starts< starts to become bigger and bigger and starts to become bigger and bigger and bigger< bigger and eventually it starts to match bigger and eventually it starts to match the< the expiration risk profile where you the expiration risk profile where you could< could even lose 358 which is the max could even lose 358 which is the max loss< loss at expiration so that is why if you loss at expiration so that is why if you want< want to hold on to this trade want to hold on to this trade past< past 31 DTE it'll be better if it's only past 31 DTE it'll be better if it's only within< within this profit Zone only when it within this profit Zone only when it exceeds< exceeds right this uh profit Zone area exceeds right this uh profit Zone area on< on both sides then you can choose to on both sides then you can choose to take< take it off and if you take it off it's take it off and if you take it off it's also< also for a slight loss right it's not also for a slight loss right it's not going< going to be for a huge loss it's not going to be for a huge loss it's not going< going to be for the mix loss but if it going to be for the mix loss but if it comes< comes back right or it stays within this comes back right or it stays within this Zone< Zone over the next few days all the ways Zone over the next few days all the ways close< close to the expiration date then you close to the expiration date then you have< have a chance at higher profitability have a chance at higher profitability all< all right guys I hope this video has all right guys I hope this video has been< been helpful for you and if it has been helpful for you and if it has please<

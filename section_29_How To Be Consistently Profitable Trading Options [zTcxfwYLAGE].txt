Language: en right< right already so in today's video we're right already so in today's video we're going< going to be talking about how to be going to be talking about how to be consistently< consistently profitable trading options consistently profitable trading options and< and I'm pretty sure that this is one of and I'm pretty sure that this is one of the< the biggest questions that you have on the biggest questions that you have on your< your mind because I recently just asked your mind because I recently just asked a< a question to my subscribers I basically a question to my subscribers I basically just< just asked them you know when it comes just asked them you know when it comes to< to training options what is the single to training options what is the single biggest< biggest questions that you have and most biggest questions that you have and most of< of the response basically came back of the response basically came back something< something like this so as you can see something like this so as you can see most< most of the response are something along most of the response are something along the< the lines of getting a consistent profit the lines of getting a consistent profit consistent< consistent income right so as you can consistent income right so as you can see< see the question what is the best see the question what is the best strategy< strategy to make consistent winning strategy to make consistent winning trades< trades consistent income how to grow my trades consistent income how to grow my account< account quickly and safely as possible account quickly and safely as possible how< how to consistently generate weekly how to consistently generate weekly monthly< monthly income how to create consistent monthly income how to create consistent predictable< predictable and scalable income what a predictable and scalable income what a great< great question how to make consistent great question how to make consistent income< income cash flow how to be more income cash flow how to be more profitable< profitable how to generate income the profitable how to generate income the best< best way how to achieve consistent best way how to achieve consistent profits< profits and income for retirement how to profits and income for retirement how to generate< generate consistent income consistent generate consistent income consistent income< income consistent income basically all income consistent income basically all about< about consistent income and reducing about consistent income and reducing risk< risk which is a very good question how risk which is a very good question how to< to get a strategy to get consistent and to get a strategy to get consistent and daily< daily income daily income and< and how to have no losing trades now and how to have no losing trades now this< this question down here takes the price this question down here takes the price right< right so most of the questions down here right so most of the questions down here are< are asking about how to generate a are asking about how to generate a consistent< consistent income which means to say consistent income which means to say they< they kind of already know that there are they kind of already know that there. are ups< ups and downs when trading but this guy ups and downs when trading but this guy man< man this question is the best this man this question is the best this question< question is on a whole new level and I question is on a whole new level and I really< really wish I had thought about this really wish I had thought about this question< question when I first started right so question when I first started right so this< this is actually a pretty good questions this is actually a pretty good questions right< right how to have no losing trades so right how to have no losing trades so unfortunately< unfortunately my friend as much as I unfortunately my friend as much as I wish< wish that there was a way to avoid wish that there was a way to avoid losses< losses I wish I could do that as well losses I wish I could do that as well but< but unfortunately there's really no way but unfortunately there's really no way for< for you to avoid losing trades because for you to avoid losing trades because when< when we're trading the markets when when we're trading the markets when you're< you're putting money into the financial you're putting money into the financial markets< markets there's always a chance to lose markets there's always a chance to lose money< money right otherwise everybody will be money right otherwise everybody will be just< just putting the money in there and just putting the money in there and nobody< nobody will be losers right so instead nobody will be losers right so instead of< of thinking how to have no losing trades of thinking how to have no losing trades what< what you want to do is to think about what you want to do is to think about how< how you can reduce risk right like this how you can reduce risk right like this person< person have us which is a very good person have us which is a very good question< question right so the whole idea of question right so the whole idea of trading< trading is to not only just generate trading is to not only just generate profits< profits but also how to manage your risk profits but also how to manage your risk to< to a manageable level so that you will to a manageable level so that you will not< not be shaked out of your trade right so not be shaked out of your trade right so that< that you will continue putting on trades that you will continue putting on trades and< and over time you'll be profitable so and over time you'll be profitable so that< that is the most important thing but if that is the most important thing but if you< you really want to have no losing trades you really want to have no losing trades then< then I think the only way the best way then I think the only way the best way is< is to not trade the financial markets at is to not trade the financial markets at all< all right rather you just put it into all right rather you just put it into you< you know the U. S treasury bills or maybe you know the U.

S treasury bills or maybe some< some government bonds and then just get some government bonds and then just get the< the fixed return at the end of the term the fixed return at the end of the term right< right so that's the only other way now right so that's the only other way now if< if you manage to find a way to not have if you manage to find a way to not have any< any losing trades please let me know any losing trades please let me know I'll< I'll be the first person to sign up for I'll be the first person to sign up for it< it all right but other than that there it all right but other than that there really< really is no way to avoid losing trades really is no way to avoid losing trades so< so what you want to focus on as what so what you want to focus on as what this< this person say is to reduce risk okay this person say is to reduce risk okay so< so let's get into the main question the so let's get into the main question the main< main topic of this video which is how to main topic of this video which is how to be< be consistently profitable trading be consistently profitable trading options< options and there are four ways that you options and there are four ways that you can< can do it I'll be showing you four ways can do it I'll be showing you four ways in< in this video and the very first way is in this video and the very first way is to< to sell premium instead of buying to sell premium instead of buying premium< premium so when it comes to trading premium so when it comes to trading options< options there are basically two sites options there are basically two sites you< you can take you can either sell premium you can take you can either sell premium or< or you can buy premium so why do you or you can buy premium so why do you want< want to sell premium instead of buying want to sell premium instead of buying premium< premium right so selling Primo will premium right so selling Primo will always< always have a higher probability of always have a higher probability of profit< profit than buying premium so for profit than buying premium so for example< example let's just take a very simple example let's just take a very simple strategy< strategy basically the credit spreads strategy basically the credit spreads versus< versus the debit spread so credit spread versus the debit spread so credit spread is< is basically you receive a credit is basically you receive a credit upfront< upfront whereas for a debit spread you upfront whereas for a debit spread you will< will be paying the premium upfront right will be paying the premium upfront right so< so an example of this is the short put so an example of this is the short put spread< spread so as you can see the short put spread so as you can see the short put spread< spread basically is you are selling a spread basically is you are selling a put< put option that is out of the money and put option that is out of the money and then< then you're buying back another put then you're buying back another put right< right slightly further out of the money right slightly further out of the money again< again so in the sense where you have again so in the sense where you have some< some sort of protection at this point some sort of protection at this point all< all right so as you can see for this all right so as you can see for this strategy< strategy there is a roughly almost 80 strategy there is a roughly almost 80 percent< percent win rate for this because we're percent win rate for this because we're putting< putting the shot put spread at around 20 putting the shot put spread at around 20 Deltas< Deltas now on the other hand you have Deltas now on the other hand you have the< the long call spread so this both are the long call spread so this both are bullish< bullish strategies that means if you bullish strategies that means if you think< think that the market is going to go up think that the market is going to go up you< you can put on both strategies right the you can put on both strategies right the shot< shot put spread is slightly more neutral shot put spread is slightly more neutral to< to bullish because as you can see this to bullish because as you can see this is< is where the current market is is where the current market is now< now it can go down as long as it does now it can go down as long as it does not< not go down to your break even price not go down to your break even price down< down here you will still be profitable down here you will still be profitable on< on the shot put spread but whereas for on the shot put spread but whereas for the< the long call spread as you can see the long call spread as you can see your< your break-even point is pretty much your break-even point is pretty much right< right at where the current market price right at where the current market price is< is so this is pretty much as you can see is so this is pretty much as you can see a< a 50 50 proposition and that is pretty a 50 50 proposition and that is pretty much< much the best you can get for a debit much the best you can get for a debit spread< spread right debit spread most of the spread right debit spread most of the time< time you get 50 at the best and then time you get 50 at the best and then some< some people like to buy out of the money some people like to buy out of the money called< called spread right if you buy all the called spread right if you buy all the money< money call spread then your probability money call spread then your probability is< is going to even drop even further so is going to even drop even further so when< when it comes to selling premium the when it comes to selling premium the advantage< advantage you have is that you will have advantage you have is that you will have a< a higher probability of profit and this a higher probability of profit and this is< is very important because you see a is very important because you see a lower< lower probability trade setup right you lower probability trade setup right you have< have actually a longer losing streak have actually a longer losing streak compared< compared to a higher probability trade compared to a higher probability trade right< right so this is the table where it right so this is the table where it tells< tells you what is the possibility of a tells you what is the possibility of a losing< losing streak that you can have so for losing streak that you can have so for example< example if you are looking at a 50 win example if you are looking at a 50 win rate< rate strategy let's say just a simple rate strategy let's say just a simple coin< coin toss right let's say if you were to coin toss right let's say if you were to flip< flip the coin right what are the chances flip the coin right what are the chances of< of it appearing four in the times four of it appearing four in the times four in< in a row hits all Tails right four and in a row hits all Tails right four and four< four in the row as you can see the four in the row as you can see the probability< probability of it is pretty much 100 probability of it is pretty much 100 that< that means it is very possible for you that means it is very possible for you to< to get four hits in a row or four tails to get four hits in a row or four tails in< in a row so if you are actually trading in a row so if you are actually trading the< the debit spread with a 50 win rate what the debit spread with a 50 win rate what it< it means is that it's possible for you it means is that it's possible for you to< to just hit this maximum loss to just hit this maximum loss at< at this point four times in a row right at this point four times in a row right so< so you're gonna go through a losing so you're gonna go through a losing streak< streak of four times in a row now if you streak of four times in a row now if you go< go to the longer losing streaks let's go to the longer losing streaks let's say< say somewhere around seven losing say somewhere around seven losing streaks< streaks you can see there still is a 52 streaks you can see there still is a 52 chance< chance that you could lose seven times chance that you could lose seven times in< in a row right so imagine you are in a row right so imagine you are trading< trading the debit spread you're trading trading the debit spread you're trading this< this long call spread where you're this long call spread where you're bullish< bullish on the stock and then you lose bullish on the stock and then you lose seven< seven times in a row now this strategy seven times in a row now this strategy could< could be profitable in the long run that could be profitable in the long run that means< means to say it could have a positive means to say it could have a positive expectancy< expectancy at the end of let's say a expectancy at the end of let's say a thousand< thousand trades you could be profitable thousand trades you could be profitable no< no doubt about that but along the way no doubt about that but along the way you're< you're going to experience bouts of you're going to experience bouts of losing< losing streaks right so imagine let's losing streaks right so imagine let's say< say you hit a losing streak of seven say you hit a losing streak of seven times< times right seven losses in a row now times right seven losses in a row now this< this now comes down to your psychology this now comes down to your psychology because< because as us humans we always want to because as us humans we always want to win< win in a sense right so if you have win in a sense right so if you have seven< seven losses in a row what are the seven losses in a row what are the chances< chances of you being able to put the chances of you being able to put the eighth< eighth straight on or the ninth straight eighth straight on or the ninth straight on< on right you need to have the confidence on right you need to have the confidence to< to place the neck straight on so it's to place the neck straight on so it's actually< actually very important to have a good actually very important to have a good psychology< psychology when it comes to trading and psychology when it comes to trading and when< when you're trading this 50 kind of uh when you're trading this 50 kind of uh strategy< strategy well it could be profitable strategy well it could be profitable online< online you really do need to have a online you really do need to have a strong< strong psychology to really pull the strong psychology to really pull the trigger< trigger especially after losing seven in trigger especially after losing seven in a< a row in fact don't even say seven times a row in fact don't even say seven times in< in a row what if you lose just three in a row what if you lose just three times< times in a row what will happen right times in a row what will happen right your< your psychology will start to say you your psychology will start to say you know< know you start to doubt the strategy you know you start to doubt the strategy you start< start to doubt whether is it actually start to doubt whether is it actually working< working is it going to make money or working is it going to make money or maybe< maybe there's something wrong with your maybe there's something wrong with your analysis< analysis this is where you start to get analysis this is where you start to get analysis< analysis paralysis you start to analysis paralysis you start to overthink< overthink and then you cannot even pull overthink and then you cannot even pull or< or rather you can't even push the button or rather you can't even push the button to< to enter into the trade so that's one of to enter into the trade so that's one of the< the problems of getting into this kind the problems of getting into this kind of< of strategies where the win rate is not of strategies where the win rate is not that< that high right especially 50 kind of a that high right especially 50 kind of a win< win rate strategy especially also you win rate strategy especially also you can< can see can see if< if you have a losing straight of 10 if you have a losing straight of 10 right< right this is out of 100 Trade sequence right this is out of 100 Trade sequence the< the pro the chances of you actually the pro the chances of you actually having< having 10 losers in a row is still having 10 losers in a row is still pretty< pretty possible right it's nine percent pretty possible right it's nine percent so< so imagine you hit a 10 losers in a row so imagine you hit a 10 losers in a row you< you hit 10 losing trades in a row how is you hit 10 losing trades in a row how is that< that going to affect your psychology that going to affect your psychology it's< it's definitely going to affect because it's definitely going to affect because it's< it's going to be very hard for you to it's going to be very hard for you to place< place the next trade so now let's take a place the next trade so now let's take a look< look about what about a strategy with 80 look about what about a strategy with 80 win< win rate right so this is pretty much win rate right so this is pretty much like< like the shot put spread strategy like the shot put spread strategy so< so you can see for a short put spread so you can see for a short put spread there< there is also a chance that you could there is also a chance that you could lose< lose like up to five times in a row lose like up to five times in a row right< right five times in a row is pretty big right five times in a row is pretty big but< but you can see the chances of it losing but you can see the chances of it losing five< five times in a row is only three five times in a row is only three percent< percent so that means to say that most percent so that means to say that most of< of the time you're actually going to be of the time you're actually going to be winning< winning so for example if there are two winning so for example if there are two pups< pups that are going to lead you to the pups that are going to lead you to the same< same profitable outcome which path would same profitable outcome which path would you< you take right you're gonna get the pot you take right you're gonna get the pot of< of gold at the end of the day would you of gold at the end of the day would you take< take the very long and windy road path take the very long and windy road path number< number one or would you rather take path number one or would you rather take path number< number two which is pretty even you know number two which is pretty even you know there's< there's not much ups and downs you still there's not much ups and downs you still get< get your potent goals so chances are of get your potent goals so chances are of course< course you will go for the second path course you will go for the second path because< because why do I want to put myself because why do I want to put myself through< through so much headache just to reach through so much headache just to reach the< the same kind of results so similarly if the same kind of results so similarly if there< there were two strategies right the there were two strategies right the first< first strategy and the second strategy first strategy and the second strategy as< as you can see both of them achieve the as you can see both of them achieve the same< same profit at the end of the day right same profit at the end of the day right but< but then for strategy one you can see but then for strategy one you can see how< how much volatility that you have to how much volatility that you have to face< face right a lot of ups and downs losing face right a lot of ups and downs losing streaks< streaks and basically a lot of these ups streaks and basically a lot of these ups and< and downs finally before you can reach and downs finally before you can reach your< your end point whereas for strategy 2 your end point whereas for strategy 2 you< you can see it's much more consistent you can see it's much more consistent and< and much more stable in a sense and and much more stable in a sense and finally< finally you reach your outcome of having finally you reach your outcome of having the< the same results right having the same the same results right having the same profit< profit at the end of the day obviously profit at the end of the day obviously which< which one you will choose we would which one you will choose we would choose< choose strategy two and that's where choose strategy two and that's where High< High probably trades come in right so High probably trades come in right so finally< finally the last key point about selling finally the last key point about selling premium< premium is that time Decay is on your premium is that time Decay is on your side< side right so whenever you're selling side right so whenever you're selling premium< premium we have Theta working for you premium we have Theta working for you and< and this is very important because the and this is very important because the market< market can go nowhere right so let's say market can go nowhere right so let's say for< for example you enter into the trade for example you enter into the trade here< here and the market goes nowhere right here and the market goes nowhere right it< it stays due or maybe it goes down a it stays due or maybe it goes down a little< little bit so in this case even though little bit so in this case even though it< it stays still or goes down a little bit it stays still or goes down a little bit you< you still make money at the end of the you still make money at the end of the day< day because your data working for you day because your data working for you but< but if you have the long call spread but if you have the long call spread guess< guess what if you stay still or go down guess what if you stay still or go down a< a little bit then you won't be making a little bit then you won't be making any< any money in fact you'll be having a any money in fact you'll be having a loss< loss now you might be saying Davis I've loss now you might be saying Davis I've already< already been selling premium but I'm already been selling premium but I'm still< still not getting the kind of consistent still not getting the kind of consistent results< results right I'm still not getting results right I'm still not getting consistent< consistent profits I still got a pretty consistent profits I still got a pretty large< large losing streak so if that's the large losing streak so if that's the case< case then you want to take note of the case then you want to take note of the second< second thing which you can do which is second thing which you can do which is to< to treat the expected move now I've to treat the expected move now I've already< already gone to detail in another video already gone to detail in another video about< about the expected move you can go ahead about the expected move you can go ahead and< and watch that I'll put the link in the and watch that I'll put the link in the top< top right hand corner of this video but top right hand corner of this video but for< for this video I just give a very brief for this video I just give a very brief overview< overview about what the expected move is overview about what the expected move is it< it basically is the amount that the it basically is the amount that the stock< stock is expected to either go up or stock is expected to either go up or down< down from its current price by a certain down from its current price by a certain time< time based on its current level of time based on its current level of implied< implied volatility all right so there's implied volatility all right so there's a< a whole calculation to find out you know a whole calculation to find out you know how< how to find what's the expected move we how to find what's the expected move we won't< won't go into that but basically there won't go into that but basically there are< are two simple ways for you to identify are two simple ways for you to identify the< the expected move and that is by looking the expected move and that is by looking at< at your option chain and you can take a at your option chain and you can take a look< look at the number down here on the look at the number down here on the right< right hand side this tells you what is right hand side this tells you what is the< the rough range that the market will the rough range that the market will make< make right so this is the expected move make right so this is the expected move range< range so up 16 points and down 16 points range so up 16 points and down 16 points so< so basically what you want to do is that so basically what you want to do is that you< you will find the strikes that are up 16 you will find the strikes that are up 16 points< points and down 16 points from where the points and down 16 points from where the current< current market is and that is the current market is and that is the expected< expected move the other way is by using expected move the other way is by using 16< 16 Deltas all right so why this is 16 Deltas all right so why this is important< important it's important because of the important it's important because of the fact< fact that implied volatility usually fact that implied volatility usually overstates< overstates the actual volatility right overstates the actual volatility right what< what it means is that the theoretical what it means is that the theoretical win< win rate based on the implied volatility win rate based on the implied volatility is< is always lower than the kind of win is always lower than the kind of win rate< rate that you're actually getting so for rate that you're actually getting so for example< example as you can see this is a study example as you can see this is a study that< that has been done and it shows that that has been done and it shows that when< when you're using the expected formula when you're using the expected formula right< right theoretically you should be only right theoretically you should be only getting< getting 68 win rate but instead of getting 68 win rate but instead of getting< getting 68 what you're actually winning getting 68 what you're actually winning is< is 85 percent of the time or 71 percent is 85 percent of the time or 71 percent of< of the time so as you can see you of the time so as you can see you actually< actually win more than what the theory actually win more than what the theory suggests< suggests which means to say for example suggests which means to say for example if< if we were to just take a look at this if we were to just take a look at this probability< probability down here of this shot put probability down here of this shot put spread< spread it says that you're winning 80 spread it says that you're winning 80 theoretically< theoretically Right theory wise you're theoretically Right theory wise you're going< going to win 80 of the time but the fact going to win 80 of the time but the fact is< is that you're actually going to win is that you're actually going to win more< more than 80 percent of time because more than 80 percent of time because this< this point down here is based on the this point down here is based on the implied< implied volatility where. is realized implied volatility where is realized volatility< volatility states that the market will volatility states that the market will actually< actually move lesser which means to say actually move lesser which means to say that< that most of the time the market will be that most of the time the market will be staying< staying within this area more often than staying within this area more often than not< not so that is why your win rate will not so that is why your win rate will actually< actually be higher than what is being actually be higher than what is being stated< stated so that is how you can improve stated so that is how you can improve your< your winning rate right so if you've your winning rate right so if you've been trading< been trading options you know that been trading options you know that you're< you're selling credit spreads that are you're selling credit spreads that are much< much higher Delta maybe for example much higher Delta maybe for example you're< you're selling at 40 Deltas or 35 Deltas you're selling at 40 Deltas or 35 Deltas maybe< maybe you want to lower the Delta a maybe you want to lower the Delta a little< little bit more maybe somewhere to little bit more maybe somewhere to around< around 25 or 20 Delta so this way you around 25 or 20 Delta so this way you can< can increase your win rate and your can increase your win rate and your consistency< consistency or profit as well so another consistency or profit as well so another study< study has been done to show that the study has been done to show that the historically< historically the average realized move historically the average realized move always< always is lesser than the average always is lesser than the average expected< expected move regardless of the impact expected move regardless of the impact volatility< volatility level you can see down here volatility level you can see down here this< this is for spiders you can see when the this is for spiders you can see when the implied< implied volatility is low implied volatility is low the< the expected move is still higher than the expected move is still higher than the< the realized move so even when when the the realized move so even when when the IV< IV is very high same thing as well in IV is very high same thing as well in fact< fact in all scenarios you can see the fact in all scenarios you can see the expected< expected move is much higher than the expected move is much higher than the realized< realized move so again this means that realized move so again this means that you< you will win more often than the you will win more often than the theoretical< theoretical numbers suggests and this is theoretical numbers suggests and this is same< same for even the iwm you can see again same for even the iwm you can see again the< the expected move is all overstated the expected move is all overstated compared< compared to the actual move that the compared to the actual move that the market< market makes and this is in QQQ as well market makes and this is in QQQ as well so< so when you start to trade the expected so when you start to trade the expected move< move you will find that the profits move you will find that the profits becomes< becomes much more consistent because becomes much more consistent because you're< you're going to win much more as well you're going to win much more as well all< all right so the third point is to trade all right so the third point is to trade index< index ETFs index ETFs so< so the reason you want to trade index so the reason you want to trade index ETFs< ETFs as opposed to individual stocks is ETFs as opposed to individual stocks is because< because individual stocks tend to be a because individual stocks tend to be a little< little bit more volatile so when we are little bit more volatile so when we are trading< trading premiums when we are selling trading premiums when we are selling premium< premium we basically want to have the premium we basically want to have the stock< stock or the underlying uh security that stock or the underlying uh security that we're< we're trading not to move that much we're trading not to move that much right< right because we wanted to stay in a right because we wanted to stay in a certain< certain range bound ideally right so for certain range bound ideally right so for example< example if you're going to put something example if you're going to put something like< like an iron Condor ideally you do not like an iron Condor ideally you do not want< want the market to move that much right want the market to move that much right until< until expiration you want the the price until expiration you want the the price to< to just stay in within the profit zone to just stay in within the profit zone so< so that you can hit the max profit when so that you can hit the max profit when it< it expires so as you can see this graph it expires so as you can see this graph down< down here shows that the stocks are much down here shows that the stocks are much more< more volatile than the ETFs you can see more volatile than the ETFs you can see down< down here that in terms of the standard down here that in terms of the standard deviation< deviation you can see these stocks deviation you can see these stocks actually< actually move out of their range much actually move out of their range much more< more than the index ETF you can see more than the index ETF you can see index< index ETFs the small movement range from index ETFs the small movement range from this< this point to here this point to here mix< mix up the majority of the moves in the mix up the majority of the moves in the market< market right so roughly from 40 to 60 market right so roughly from 40 to 60 percent< percent of the time it's going to stay percent of the time it's going to stay within< within this tight range which is very within this tight range which is very good< good for us because we're selling good for us because we're selling premium< premium where it does we don't want it premium where it does we don't want it to< to move that much but whereas for stocks to move that much but whereas for stocks you< you can see how volatile it is right it you can see how volatile it is right it moves< moves very wide moves a lot of these moves very wide moves a lot of these outliables< outliables which can cause losses for outliables which can cause losses for your< your trades your trades so< so you can see the number of times the so you can see the number of times the or< or rather the percentage of it actually or rather the percentage of it actually staying< staying somewhere in the middle where it staying somewhere in the middle where it doesn't< doesn't move much is actually pretty low doesn't move much is actually pretty low compact< compact compared to the index ETF so compact compared to the index ETF so that< that is why if you want to have more that is why if you want to have more consistency< consistency in profits trading the index consistency in profits trading the index ETFs< ETFs definitely will help and the other ETFs definitely will help and the other thing< thing is that index ETFs are not thing is that index ETFs are not sensitive< sensitive to individual stock earning sensitive to individual stock earning moves< moves and Company specific news as well moves and Company specific news as well so< so as you know individual stocks always so as you know individual stocks always release< release earnings right so whenever release earnings right so whenever there's< there's earnings the market tends to there's earnings the market tends to have< have very big moves either Gap up or gap have very big moves either Gap up or gap down< down and these are the things that we down and these are the things that we pretty< pretty much want to kind of avoid when pretty much want to kind of avoid when we< we are trading uh options right rather we are trading uh options right rather when< when we are selling premium the other when we are selling premium the other thing< thing is that companies are very thing is that companies are very susceptible< susceptible to the individual specific susceptible to the individual specific news< news which they have right and all this news which they have right and all this comes< comes very suddenly right you never know comes very suddenly right you never know so< so for example when Disney released the so for example when Disney released the latest< latest movie the last time the Avatar it latest movie the last time the Avatar it did< did not do so well and all of a sudden did not do so well and all of a sudden the< the stock really went down right it the stock really went down right it tanked< tanked so much and this moves out of the tanked so much and this moves out of the expected< expected both so anybody that have any expected both so anybody that have any trades< trades on whether the selling premium trades on whether the selling premium tend< tend to have lost money and Google as tend to have lost money and Google as well< well recently they released the news well recently they released the news right< right alphabet the apparent company they right alphabet the apparent company they released< released the the Google AI chatbot bot released the the Google AI chatbot bot and< and then because of the ad there's some and then because of the ad there's some floor< floor in it right the answer was wrong floor in it right the answer was wrong that< that is why the market saw this as a that is why the market saw this as a very< very bad news and they started to sell very bad news and they started to sell the< the stock tremendously and that's where the stock tremendously and that's where he< he started to move out of the expected he started to move out of the expected move< move as well so when you're trading move as well so when you're trading index< index ETFs you don't have any of this index ETFs you don't have any of this Shenanigans< Shenanigans right you have any of this Shenanigans right you have any of this funny< funny stuff that's happening so that is funny stuff that's happening so that is why< why it's much more stable and much more why it's much more stable and much more conservative< conservative compared to trading conservative compared to trading individual< individual stocks and the final method individual stocks and the final method that< that you can use to have consistency in that you can use to have consistency in your< your profits is to spread out your trade your profits is to spread out your trade so< so what do I mean right so let's say for so what do I mean right so let's say for example< example you want to put on a put spread example you want to put on a put spread right< right you want to put on a short put right you want to put on a short put spread< spread and based on your trading account spread and based on your trading account size< size you're able to put on three put size you're able to put on three put spreads< spreads around this area let's say at spreads around this area let's say at the< the hundred dollars price right so the hundred dollars price right so instead< instead of putting all three put spreads instead of putting all three put spreads at< at this price what you could do is that at this price what you could do is that you< you you can split them up right you can you you can split them up right you can split< split them up to different prices so split them up to different prices so that< that it's different Deltas so when you that it's different Deltas so when you split< split them up into different Deltas so split them up into different Deltas so suddenly< suddenly you do not have all your eggs suddenly you do not have all your eggs in< in one basket right so for example if in one basket right so for example if you< you were to trade three put spreads just you were to trade three put spreads just at< at this point if the market was to close at this point if the market was to close somewhere< somewhere here then guess what chances somewhere here then guess what chances are< are you're going to be losing on this are you're going to be losing on this put< put spread put spread but< but if you were to split them up by but if you were to split them up by different< different deltas and the market actually different deltas and the market actually goes< goes down here then you will be losing goes down here then you will be losing on< on one put spread but the other two put on one put spread but the other two put spreads< spreads you'll be profitable so this way spreads you'll be profitable so this way it< it kind of even out your p l volatility it kind of even out your p l volatility now< now of course if the market goes up now of course if the market goes up right< right you will be profiting on all these right you will be profiting on all these three< three put spreads but it's not going to three put spreads but it's not going to be< be as much as compared to this three put be as much as compared to this three put spread< spread at one place because your premium spread at one place because your premium will< will be much higher for sure will be much higher for sure all< all right so the main idea down here is all right so the main idea down here is to< to remain some consistency in the to remain some consistency in the volatility< volatility of your p l so remember the volatility of your p l so remember the chart< chart that I showed you earlier on or chart that I showed you earlier on or rather< rather the graph that I show you where rather the graph that I show you where there< there are two ways for you to reach the there are two ways for you to reach the profit< profit line so it comes down to which profit line so it comes down to which one< one you want right if you want a more one you want right if you want a more Rocky< Rocky bumpy ride then you want to place Rocky bumpy ride then you want to place all< all three contracts at that point but if all three contracts at that point but if you< you want to smoothen things out make it you want to smoothen things out make it much< much more stable and consistent then you much more stable and consistent then you want< want to try and spread out your trades want to try and spread out your trades right< right so one way for you to spread out right so one way for you to spread out your< your trades will be by different Deltas your trades will be by different Deltas now< now the other way would be to split them now the other way would be to split them up< up by different days to expiration so up by different days to expiration so for< for example you could put three put for example you could put three put spread< spread but then one of them could expire spread but then one of them could expire you< you know in 30 days and then the second you know in 30 days and then the second one< one maybe 45 days and then the third one one maybe 45 days and then the third one is< is 60 days so this way all three of them is 60 days so this way all three of them have< have different kind of volatility so have different kind of volatility so when< when you do it this way then you want to when you do it this way then you want to be< be also putting all your eggs in one be also putting all your eggs in one basket< basket right because maybe for example basket right because maybe for example the< the market might come down here at the the market might come down here at the end< end of 30 days so at the end of 30 days end of 30 days so at the end of 30 days maybe< maybe this will lose money but then maybe this will lose money but then after< after 30 days in the next 10 days the after 30 days in the next 10 days the market< market goes back up again so in that market goes back up again so in that case< case you're going to make money on the case you're going to make money on the 45< 45 and the 60 days to expiration so in 45 and the 60 days to expiration so in this< this way although you put them on the this way although you put them on the same< same strike but because you have a same strike but because you have a different< different duration of your expiration different duration of your expiration then< then you are in a sense diversifying then you are in a sense diversifying your< your risk as well right you're your risk as well right you're diversifying< diversifying your trades and the final diversifying your trades and the final way< way is to enter your trades or spread way is to enter your trades or spread out< out your trades based on different days out your trades based on different days right< right so for example if you decided to right so for example if you decided to put< put on the put spread you have roughly put on the put spread you have roughly you< you know three put spreads to put on you you know three put spreads to put on you can< can say right now you're gonna put on can say right now you're gonna put on one< one put spread so as the market moves one put spread so as the market moves let's< let's say if the market starts to move let's say if the market starts to move down< down you can put on another put spread down you can put on another put spread again< again down here and then after that as again down here and then after that as the< the market moves up you put on another the market moves up you put on another put< put spread again so against this will be put spread again so against this will be putting< putting your boot spread at different putting your boot spread at different strike< strike prices so there is different strike prices so there is different Deltas< Deltas you're putting it also on Deltas you're putting it also on different< different durations right right so maybe different durations right right so maybe for< for example you know two weeks has for example you know two weeks has passed< passed since you put on the first put passed since you put on the first put spread< spread and then when the market goes spread and then when the market goes down< down you put on another put spread this down you put on another put spread this will< will be a different Delta plus also a will be a different Delta plus also a different< different expiration date then again different expiration date then again maybe< maybe another one week has passed it maybe another one week has passed it moved< moved up again and then you put on the moved up again and then you put on the put< put spread again a different Delta put spread again a different Delta different< different strike price and different different strike price and different days< days to expiration again so in this way days to expiration again so in this way basically< basically what you're doing is you're basically what you're doing is you're evening< evening out your p l right so you're evening out your p l right so you're smoothening< smoothening things out so your p l smoothening things out so your p l volatility< volatility is not that volatile so volatility is not that volatile so there's< there's a study done by the tasty trade there's a study done by the tasty trade team< team as well basically what they did is team as well basically what they did is they< they wanted to compare what happens if they wanted to compare what happens if you< you put all contracts at once versus if you put all contracts at once versus if you< you put you know one contract and spread you put you know one contract and spread them< them out across different days right so them out across different days right so for< for example let's say you have 30 for example let's say you have 30 contracts< contracts right 30 contracts you could contracts right 30 contracts you could either< either put all 30 contracts all at once either put all 30 contracts all at once at< at one time or you can spread them out at one time or you can spread them out one< one by one across 30 days right sell one one by one across 30 days right sell one every< every single day so what's this study is every single day so what's this study is trying< trying to do is they're trying to trying to do is they're trying to measure< measure you know what's the kind of measure you know what's the kind of volatility< volatility you'll get as well as the end volatility you'll get as well as the end result< result so as you can see the end result result so as you can see the end result is< is pretty similar whereby the average P is pretty similar whereby the average P L< L per contract all at once about 35 L per contract all at once about 35 dollars< dollars we're going to sell one every dollars we're going to sell one every day< day is 40 so it's pretty similar they're day is 40 so it's pretty similar they're both< both profitable and the weed rate is both profitable and the weed rate is also< also pretty similar right it's one is 82 also pretty similar right it's one is 82 percent< percent the other one is 80 but check percent the other one is 80 but check this< this out the biggest difference comes this out the biggest difference comes down< down to the volatility of down to the volatility of your< your p l you can see the volatility here your p l you can see the volatility here is< is four thousand dollars which means to is four thousand dollars which means to say< say there is a huge swing of your p l say there is a huge swing of your p l from< from one time you could be up four from one time you could be up four thousand< thousand the other time you'll be down thousand the other time you'll be down four< four thousand and the time you'll be up four thousand and the time you'll be up four< four thousand but rest if you were to four thousand but rest if you were to sell< sell one every single day your p l will sell one every single day your p l will be< be so smooth that the volatility is only be so smooth that the volatility is only 150< 150 dollars from each other and the 150 dollars from each other and the reason< reason is because when you have reason is because when you have different< different strike prices different different strike prices different expiration< expiration dates you have different kind expiration dates you have different kind of< of results for each one right for of results for each one right for example< example this will be a profit maybe this example this will be a profit maybe this is< is a loss this is a a small profit is a loss this is a a small profit another< another one is a small loss so it kind another one is a small loss so it kind of< of even things up but if you were to put of even things up but if you were to put everything< everything in just one put spread then everything in just one put spread then guess< guess what whether it's a win or loss guess what whether it's a win or loss it's< it's going to be very big difference it's going to be very big difference because< because you have everything in one because you have everything in one position< position in one strike price right so position in one strike price right so this< this is very important to understand this is very important to understand especially< especially if you want to have especially if you want to have consistency< consistency in your profits all right

========================================================================================

Language: en all< all right already so today's video we're all right already so today's video we're gonna< gonna be talking about selling covered gonna be talking about selling covered calls< calls below your entry price right so calls below your entry price right so i've< i've got a number of people who have i've got a number of people who have asked< asked me you know right now that their asked me you know right now that their stock< stock the current price of the stock is stock the current price of the stock is way< way below where they first bought it can way below where they first bought it can they< they still sell covered calls now if they still sell covered calls now if you're< you're in this position right now i you're in this position right now i totally< totally understand how you feel because totally understand how you feel because i< i do have a few positions where i i do have a few positions where i thought< thought it was undervalued when i first thought it was undervalued when i first bought< bought it but as the market crashed it bought it but as the market crashed it went< went even more undervalued so when right went even more undervalued so when right now< now the current price is so far below now the current price is so far below your< your entry price your entry price can< can you still sell cover calls you know can you still sell cover calls you know to< to reduce the cost basis of your stock to reduce the cost basis of your stock so< so is this a good strategy or is it a so is this a good strategy or is it a bad< bad mistake so let's find out together bad mistake so let's find out together so< so normally when we sell a cover call so normally when we sell a cover call what< what we want to do is ideally we want to what we want to do is ideally we want to sell< sell it above our entry price right sell it above our entry price right because< because we never know what the stock can because we never know what the stock can do< do right for example if the stock is do right for example if the stock is going< going to suddenly just shoot up way going to suddenly just shoot up way above< above our cover calls above our cover calls and< and then we are not able to roll out and and then we are not able to roll out and up< up in time right we're not going to get up in time right we're not going to get any< any extrinsic value from rolling out and any extrinsic value from rolling out and up< up then in this case our shares will be up then in this case our shares will be called< called away at expiration right or even called away at expiration right or even early< early before expiration if there's not early before expiration if there's not much< much extrinsic value left in the cover much extrinsic value left in the cover call< call so in this case at the very least call so in this case at the very least we< we will still get profits we will still get profits right< right we will get the intrinsic value right we will get the intrinsic value profits< profits the capital gains from our long profits the capital gains from our long hard< hard shares where we bought at this hard shares where we bought at this price< price and we get called away at this price and we get called away at this price< price so this is our profit including price so this is our profit including the< the premium which we sell from the cover the premium which we sell from the cover call< call so this is how we generally want to call so this is how we generally want to sell< sell our covered calls now but what if sell our covered calls now but what if the< the stock is now way below our entry the stock is now way below our entry price< price right and then can we still sell price right and then can we still sell the< the cover call below entry price to the cover call below entry price to reduce< reduce our cost basis so reduce our cost basis so you< you may have bought a hundred shares you may have bought a hundred shares maybe< maybe somewhere up here and now the maybe somewhere up here and now the stock< stock has gone all the way down here all stock has gone all the way down here all right< right so at this point of time can you right so at this point of time can you still< still sell your cover call and if you still sell your cover call and if you were< were to take a look at the were to take a look at the option< option chain you may find that the only option chain you may find that the only cover< cover call strike price which can give cover call strike price which can give you< you a decent amount of premium could be you a decent amount of premium could be somewhere< somewhere here and as you can see this somewhere here and as you can see this is< is way below where you first bought your is way below where you first bought your 100< 100 shares right 100 shares right so< so the biggest risk of selling cover so the biggest risk of selling cover calls< calls below your entry price is locking calls below your entry price is locking in< in your losses right so locking your in your losses right so locking your losses< losses basically just means that the losses basically just means that the point< point in time point in time where< where your shares get caught away if where your shares get caught away if your< your cover call gets exercised is way your cover call gets exercised is way below< below your entry price so previously we below your entry price so previously we saw< saw that the capital gains is from where saw that the capital gains is from where you< you first bought it to where you first you first bought it to where you first sell< sell to where you sell it right where sell to where you sell it right where you< you got caught away in this case as you you got caught away in this case as you can< can see where you bought it and where can see where you bought it and where your< your shares will be called away if your your shares will be called away if your cover< cover cost exercise cover cost exercise is< is different right so this is a loss is different right so this is a loss because< because you will be buying it at a because you will be buying it at a higher< higher price and you are getting your higher price and you are getting your shares< shares caught away at a lower price shares caught away at a lower price so< so this is the best so this is the best biggest< biggest risk of selling your covered biggest risk of selling your covered call< call below your entry price so in this call below your entry price so in this case case case if< if you're willing to accept the risk of if you're willing to accept the risk of locking< locking in your losses and you still locking in your losses and you still want< want to sell the cover calls to reduce want to sell the cover calls to reduce your< your cost basis your cost basis then< then you want to be very selective with then you want to be very selective with when< when and where to sell your cover calls when and where to sell your cover calls so< so what i'm trying to say is that i do so what i'm trying to say is that i do think< think that you actually can still sell think that you actually can still sell your< your cover calls even though your cover calls even though right< right the strike price might be below right the strike price might be below your< your 100 shares but you need to keep in your 100 shares but you need to keep in mind< mind or bear in mind that there is a mind or bear in mind that there is a chance< chance that if the stock was to suddenly chance that if the stock was to suddenly rally< rally all the way up and may even really rally all the way up and may even really to< to the point where you first bought the to the point where you first bought the the< the shares the shares right< right you may be locking in in a loss so right you may be locking in in a loss so this< this is where you need to be very picky this is where you need to be very picky with< with where you sell your cover calls with where you sell your cover calls right< right now for myself personally i right now for myself personally i generally< generally do not want to sell any cover generally do not want to sell any cover calls< calls that's below the entry price calls that's below the entry price because< because you never know what's going to because you never know what's going to happen< happen with an individual stock right happen with an individual stock right there< there could be certain news there could be certain news that< that would just make the stock you know that would just make the stock you know just< just gap up all the way above the cover just gap up all the way above the cover call< call and then it makes it very difficult call and then it makes it very difficult to< to roll right i understand that you know to roll right i understand that you know some< some people have the strategy that you some people have the strategy that you know< know if the stock know if the stock let's< let's say it goes all the way up to your let's say it goes all the way up to your cover< cover call cover call you< you might want to just keep rolling up you might want to just keep rolling up and< and up and up up< up and yes there's definitely a strategy up and yes there's definitely a strategy to< to do that right you can continue to to do that right you can continue to keep< keep rolling until it eventually right keep rolling until it eventually right eventually< eventually reaches the price where you eventually reaches the price where you bought< bought it at or you might even roll it bought it at or you might even roll it above< above the other chest which is above the other chest which is definitely< definitely possible but the only risk definitely possible but the only risk with< with this is that if the stock really with this is that if. the stock really rallies< rallies past rallies past very< very quickly past your cover call then very quickly past your cover call then it< it could be difficult to roll up it could be difficult to roll up and< and out each time so if you want to and out each time so if you want to reduce< reduce cost basis while still selling reduce cost basis while still selling you< you know you know cover< cover calls cover calls below< below your entry price then i would below your entry price then i would suggest< suggest to be really selective and it's suggest to be really selective and it's definitely< definitely very possible if you are good definitely very possible if you are good with< with timing the markets all right so i'm with timing the markets all right so i'm going< going to give you a few suggestions if going to give you a few suggestions if that< that is what you want to do so that is what you want to do so when< when we come to selling our cover calls when we come to selling our cover calls below< below our 100 shares we want to try as below our 100 shares we want to try as much< much as possible to reduce the risk so much as possible to reduce the risk so every< every time when i look into a position every time when i look into a position look< look into any strategy i'm always trying look into any strategy i'm always trying to< to think of you know what are ways to to think of you know what are ways to reduce< reduce the risk how can we ensure that reduce the risk how can we ensure that we< we have the lowest chance of the worst we have the lowest chance of the worst outcome< outcome as much as possible now of outcome as much as possible now of course< course if you were to just hold this course if you were to just hold this hundred< hundred shares and you do not have the hundred shares and you do not have the cover< cover calls and the market right was to cover calls and the market right was to just< just keep going down then of course you just keep going down then of course you would< would be better off just selling this would be better off just selling this cover< cover call but then again cover call but then again this< this all comes down to the stock this all comes down to the stock selection< selection when you first got into this selection when you first got into this position< position right so if you got into a position right so if you got into a stock< stock where it never goes up in the long stock where it never goes up in the long term< term no matter how many covered calls term no matter how many covered calls you< you sell it's still not going to help you sell it's still not going to help you< you mitigate the amount of loss you're you mitigate the amount of loss you're going< going to get from where you first bought going to get from where you first bought it< it to where you know the market crashes it to where you know the market crashes all< all the way to so when you want to look all the way to so when you want to look into< into any of these positions you don't into any of these positions you don't want< want to look as covered call to want to look as covered call to salvation< salvation positions but rather it's salvation positions but rather it's meant< meant to have a supplementary income on meant to have a supplementary income on top< top of holding your long hard shares top of holding your long hard shares which< which is meant to be the main driver of which is meant to be the main driver of your< your profit so ultimately good stock your profit so ultimately good stock selection< selection is still important right selection is still important right all< all right so all right so to< to reduce the risk of locking in a loss to reduce the risk of locking in a loss there< there are a few ways to do it and this there are a few ways to do it and this is< is what i would suggest so number one we is what i would suggest so number one we want< want to wait until the stock is want to wait until the stock is overbought< overbought that means to look at certain overbought that means to look at certain indicators< indicators like rsi or stochastics for indicators like rsi or stochastics for me< me i personally use the stochastics me i personally use the stochastics so< so basically the stochastics have two so basically the stochastics have two lines< lines right so this is overbought and lines right so this is overbought and below< below is oversold so what we're looking below is oversold so what we're looking at< at is for the stochastics to go above at is for the stochastics to go above this< this uh overbought now of course again this uh overbought now of course again as< as i always stress in many of my other as i always stress in many of my other videos< videos overbought can always be more videos overbought can always be more overbought< overbought as you can see this oversoap overbought as you can see this oversoap can< can still continue to be oversold as the can still continue to be oversold as the market< market crash but what we understand from market crash but what we understand from this< this indicator that it at least this indicator that it at least indicates< indicates that there is a higher indicates that there is a higher probability< probability that the market will be probability that the market will be going< going down when it's overbought than it going down when it's overbought than it going< going up right so if you had a choice to going up right so if you had a choice to either< either place your cover call when the either place your cover call when the market< market is oversold or overbought which market is oversold or overbought which would< would you choose right so the the would you choose right so the the smarter< smarter decision would definitely be smarter decision would definitely be choosing< choosing it when it's overbought because choosing it when it's overbought because there< there is a higher chance of it going there is a higher chance of it going down< down which is what you want because down which is what you want because ultimately< ultimately you're selling this cover ultimately you're selling this cover call< call not to get your shares caught away call not to get your shares caught away but< but to reduce the cost basis so imagine but to reduce the cost basis so imagine if< if the market right now is telling you if the market right now is telling you that< that it's oversold down here that it's oversold down here and< and then you start to sell a cover call and then you start to sell a cover call right< right let's say at this point of time right let's say at this point of time all< all right let me just remove all these all right let me just remove all these drawings< drawings so you can see so let's say at drawings so you can see so let's say at this< this point of time this point of time right< right the market looks like it's going right the market looks like it's going down< down and you want to try and reduce the down and you want to try and reduce the loss< loss on this right momentarily loss loss on this right momentarily loss as< as the market goes down so maybe you try as the market goes down so maybe you try to< to sell a cover call down here right so to sell a cover call down here right so maybe< maybe at this point you might sell a maybe at this point you might sell a cover< cover call that seems pretty decent cover call that seems pretty decent there's< there's quite a distance away from where there's quite a distance away from where the< the current market price is down here the current market price is down here and< and then you still get quite a decent and then you still get quite a decent amount< amount of premium but as you can see in amount of premium but as you can see in the< the next few days right this is the next few days right this is a< a few bars later maybe just a few weeks a few bars later maybe just a few weeks later< later you can see that the price only later you can see that the price only just< just showed up above here now at this just showed up above here now at this point< point of time you can see this price point of time you can see this price move< move is pretty quick pretty fast so it move is pretty quick pretty fast so it may< may be difficult for you to keep rolling may be difficult for you to keep rolling up< up and out so if the market still up and out so if the market still continues< continues to shoot up then what you have continues to shoot up then what you have done< done is that you have essentially just done is that you have essentially just locked< locked in locked in your< your losses from this point all the way your losses from this point all the way to< to where you sold your cover call down to where you sold your cover call down here< here so that is why i would prefer to here so that is why i would prefer to sell< sell my cover call when the stock is sell my cover call when the stock is overbought< overbought so again i will wait until overbought so again i will wait until the< the stochastics indicates that you know the stochastics indicates that you know it< it is overbought it is overbought then< then i will start looking to choose my then i will start looking to choose my cover< cover call strike price so next what we cover call strike price so next what we want< want to do is we want to sell a low want to do is we want to sell a low delta< delta cover call strike so generally we delta cover call strike so generally we want< want to sell something that is less than want to sell something that is less than 15< 15 deltas because remember delta also is 15 deltas because remember delta also is a< a quick indication or rather a quick a quick indication or rather a quick estimate< estimate of what is the percentage that estimate of what is the percentage that this this this uh< uh strike price will be in the money at uh strike price will be in the money at expiration< expiration so 0. 15 just indicates that expiration so 0.

15 just indicates that there's< there's roughly a 15 chance that the uh there's roughly a 15 chance that the uh cover< cover call strike price would be in the cover call strike price would be in the money money money at< at expiration right at expiration right so< so there's only a 15 chance that it will so there's only a 15 chance that it will go< go above here go above here or< or rather it will close above here or rather it will close above here at< at expiration right during the whole at expiration right during the whole course< course of this time right it might go up course of this time right it might go up go< go down and then go back up again go down and then go back up again all< all right so it's important to all right so it's important to understand< understand that when we choose a 15 understand that when we choose a 15 delta< delta it just means that there is a 15 delta it just means that there is a 15 chance< chance that the market will actually chance that the market will actually close< close above uh our cover call strike close above uh our cover call strike price< price at expiration which is good for us price at expiration which is good for us right< right we do not want a too high right we do not want a too high of< of a of a delta< delta although you get more premium on delta although you get more premium on the< the delta but if you were to sell a 30 the delta but if you were to sell a 30 delta< delta maybe it would be somewhere much delta maybe it would be somewhere much closer< closer to the market somewhere around closer to the market somewhere around this< this point right so as you can see it's this point right so as you can see it's much< much easier to go up now the loss which much easier to go up now the loss which you're< you're going to lose you're going to lose right< right in terms of the the difference right in terms of the the difference sorry< sorry the difference between this value sorry the difference between this value the< the two strike price and the premium the two strike price and the premium right< right this will always be greater than right this will always be greater than the< the premium which you receive so for the premium which you receive so for example< example here this might be five points example here this might be five points right< right five point difference but in the right five point difference but in the cover< cover call premium you might probably cover call premium you might probably only< only receive two dollars or maybe up to only receive two dollars or maybe up to three< three dollars right so that is why i three dollars right so that is why i would< would rather sell a further away cover would rather sell a further away cover call< call receive less premium so in this call receive less premium so in this case< case i will have a lesser chance of the case i will have a lesser chance of the stock< stock price right the stock going above stock price right the stock going above here here here and< and maybe if it does touch here there and maybe if it does touch here there might< might be not much extrinsic value left might be not much extrinsic value left that< that i could just roll out and up so that i could just roll out and up so basically< basically when i sell a low delta cover basically when i sell a low delta cover call< call strike price it will really reduce call strike price it will really reduce the< the chance of the market actually just the chance of the market actually just going< going up above here and you know going up above here and you know avoiding< avoiding this locking of the losses avoiding this locking of the losses which< which is as much as possible we want to which is as much as possible we want to avoid avoid avoid so< so the next thing we want to do is to so the next thing we want to do is to sell< sell our cover call above a resistance sell our cover call above a resistance level< level or a previous high as much as level or a previous high as much as possible< possible so market always move in waves possible so market always move in waves as< as you know so the wave as you know so the wave right< right whenever there is a resistance right whenever there is a resistance there's< there's always a chance that the market there's always a chance that the market could< could turn down so previous highs are could turn down so previous highs are basically< basically places where the market right basically places where the market right as< as you can see has shown that there is as you can see has shown that there is some< some sort of selling pressure you can some sort of selling pressure you can see< see the market came down here went up see the market came down here went up here< here and it went back down here again so here and it went back down here again so this< this can serve as a previous high so this can serve as a previous high so what< what you want to do is you want to sell what you want to do is you want to sell a< a cover call strike price that is above a cover call strike price that is above here< here because there could be a chance here because there could be a chance that< that the market goes up here that the market goes up here and< and then it meets with resistance and and then it meets with resistance and then< then it goes back down again right and then it goes back down again right and also< also we can also take a look at the also we can also take a look at the dynamic< dynamic resistance levels that means it dynamic resistance levels that means it doesn't< doesn't just have to be previous you doesn't just have to be previous you know< know support resistance levels or know support resistance levels or previous< previous high it could be moving previous high it could be moving averages< averages as well right so as you can see averages as well right so as you can see this< this moving average could serve as a this moving average could serve as a dynamic< dynamic resistance that means as the dynamic resistance that means as the market< market go up here market go up here it< it can from here it can from here find< find some sort of a selling pressure find some sort of a selling pressure some< some sort of resistance and then it some sort of resistance and then it comes< comes back down again so comes back down again so this< this a few of this criteria these three this a few of this criteria these three criteria< criteria will help you really reduce the criteria will help you really reduce the chance< chance of the market really going past chance of the market really going past this< this cover call strike price right so this cover call strike price right so the< the last one is to avoid selling cover the last one is to avoid selling cover calls< calls into earnings because as we calls into earnings because as we already< already know earnings is very volatile already know earnings is very volatile right< right it can go either way it doesn't right it can go either way it doesn't matter< matter you know what the matter you know what the earnings< earnings results is it what comes down earnings results is it what comes down is< is the interpretation of what is the interpretation of what the< the market views it to be right could be the market views it to be right could be good< good news could be good earnings but good news could be good earnings but then< then the market might just sell it off then the market might just sell it off right< right or it might be bad news in the right or it might be bad news in the market< market also just you know buy it up and market also just you know buy it up and there's< there's a big gap up or gap down so that there's a big gap up or gap down so that is< is why you want to avoid selling cover is why you want to avoid selling cover coin< coin to earnings now i know some people coin to earnings now i know some people could< could be tempted to sell cover calls could be tempted to sell cover calls into< into earnings because that's when the into earnings because that's when the premium< premium are the most juicy right maybe premium are the most juicy right maybe during< during normal times you could sell this during normal times you could sell this cover< cover call for let's say a dollar but cover call for let's say a dollar but when< when it's close to earnings when it's close to earnings right< right maybe this one dollar might be right maybe this one dollar might be beefed< beefed up to two dollars or maybe even beefed up to two dollars or maybe even three< three dollars right so you might be you three dollars right so you might be you know< know very tempted to sell a much juicier know very tempted to sell a much juicier a< a more premium covered call that's right a more premium covered call that's right but< but the thing is that it also factored but the thing is that it also factored in< in the volatility that means there is a in the volatility that means there is a chance< chance as well that the market could chance as well that the market could just< just gap up right so if you have seen just gap up right so if you have seen some< some of the earnings from let's say some of the earnings from let's say facebook< facebook right meta facebook right meta even< even amazon even amazon adobe< adobe you can see there's a lot of a gap adobe you can see there's a lot of a gap when< when the earnings come out right so if when the earnings come out right so if you< you want to avoid the chances that there you want to avoid the chances that there could< could be a huge gap up right you may could be a huge gap up right you may even< even gap up even gap up above above above your< your cover call strike price at this your cover call strike price at this point< point it becomes quite difficult for you point it becomes quite difficult for you to< to roll out and up because to roll out and up because your< your cover call is going to get a little your cover call is going to get a little bit< bit too expensive if you want to roll bit too expensive if you want to roll out< out and up you may even have to roll to out and up you may even have to roll to such< such a very far dated expiration time such a very far dated expiration time right< right so maybe if you sold this let's right so maybe if you sold this let's say< say you want to do. the the weeklies say you want to do the the weeklies right< right maybe you sold a 14 days right maybe you sold a 14 days dte< dte right dte right covered< covered call covered call and< and then and then on< on the earnings day itself the next day on the earnings day itself the next day it< it just gapped up somewhere down here it just gapped up somewhere down here right< right so if you kept up way above your right so if you kept up way above your your< your cover call strike price somewhere your cover call strike price somewhere around< around here if you want to roll on up around here if you want to roll on up right< right now you will notice that you may right now you will notice that you may have< have to roll all the way to 90 days or have to roll all the way to 90 days or maybe< maybe even 180 days and this 180 days maybe even 180 days and this 180 days may< may not even be above where you first may not even be above where you first bought< bought your 100 shares so you may be bought your 100 shares so you may be stuck< stuck with a cover call strike price stuck with a cover call strike price maybe< maybe the most you could roll up to maybe the most you could roll up to would< would be maybe this price right if you would be maybe this price right if you roll< roll it to this price you may have to roll it to this price you may have to hold< hold it for maybe 180 days hold it for maybe 180 days so< so this is this is one of the traps that so this is this is one of the traps that you< you have you have when< when selling a cover call that is below when selling a cover call that is below your< your entry price right you if you hold your entry price right you if you hold it< it on to this strike price for 180 days it on to this strike price for 180 days you< you cannot let go of it and the worst you cannot let go of it and the worst thing< thing is the market continues to rally thing is the market continues to rally and< and if that happens you you know you're and if that happens you you know you're just< just much better off if you had just not just much better off if you had just not soaked< soaked the cover call in the first place soaked the cover call in the first place right< right but of course we want to reduce right but of course we want to reduce our< our cost basis our cost basis you< you want to sell the cover call so the you want to sell the cover call so the best< best way is to use this four criteria best way is to use this four criteria which< which i've set out to reduces the which i've set out to reduces the chances< chances that your cover call strike chances that your cover call strike price< price will end up in the money at price will end up in the money at expiration< expiration so what do you do if your expiration so what do you do if your cover< cover call is breached so let's say you cover call is breached so let's say you have< have really you know followed this four have really you know followed this four criteria< criteria which i've set out down here criteria which i've set out down here and< and then the stock price goes all the and then the stock price goes all the way< way up to your cover call right so what way up to your cover call right so what do you< do you want to do so there are two do you want to do so there are two methods< methods that you can do so i've actually methods that you can do so i've actually created< created a video on rolling cover calls created a video on rolling cover calls already< already if you haven't watched that already if you haven't watched that please< please go ahead and watch that as well please go ahead and watch that as well i'll< i'll put the link at the top right hand i'll put the link at the top right hand corner< corner of this video but basically if corner of this video but basically if the the the price< price reaches your cover call strike price reaches your cover call strike price< price if you want to be really defensive price if you want to be really defensive then< then this is where you want to roll then this is where you want to roll because< because as much as possible you do not because as much as possible you do not want< want to let the cover call get in the want to let the cover call get in the money< money right you do not want it to expire money right you do not want it to expire in< in the money and expiration so once it in the money and expiration so once it touches< touches your cover call strike price touches your cover call strike price this< this is where you want to roll out and this is where you want to roll out and up< up right so whenever up right so whenever the< the strike price or rather the the stock the strike price or rather the the stock reaches< reaches your cover call strike price reaches your cover call strike price there< there is always a chance or rather an there is always a chance or rather an opportunity< opportunity that you can roll out up opportunity that you can roll out up because< because it hasn't actually gone inside because it hasn't actually gone inside your< your cover call yet so at this point of your cover call yet so at this point of time< time at the money cover call strike time at the money cover call strike prices< prices have the most extrinsic value so prices have the most extrinsic value so you< you have the most extrinsic value you have the most extrinsic value transferred< transferred to the following months transferred to the following months right< right so you can always roll out and up right so you can always roll out and up and< and you can keep doing this and you can keep doing this to< to keep rolling and hopefully it can to keep rolling and hopefully it can roll< roll to the point where you are at least roll to the point where you are at least at< at the point where you first bought your at the point where you first bought your 100< 100 shares if not even higher than that 100 shares if not even higher than that right< right so this way you can at least lock right so this way you can at least lock in< in a profit so in a profit so this< this is what you want to do if the this is what you want to do if the if< if the stock price touches your cover if the stock price touches your cover call call call now< now the downside of this is that as i now the downside of this is that as i mentioned< mentioned earlier is that you could roll mentioned earlier is that you could roll all< all the way to a much further dated all the way to a much further dated expiration< expiration date so maybe you start off expiration date so maybe you start off with< with 14 days right let's say you start with 14 days right let's say you start 14< 14 days then maybe let's say five days 14 days then maybe let's say five days later< later it touches your strike price it later it touches your strike price it touches< touches your strike price now you want touches your strike price now you want to< to roll out and up so if you roll on up to roll out and up so if you roll on up and< and you notice that the furthest you can and you notice that the furthest you can go< go to or rather the nearest that you go to or rather the nearest that you could< could go to could go to where< where you can get a decent you know where you can get a decent you know a< a distance away the next strike price a distance away the next strike price will< will maybe 60 days to expiration then will maybe 60 days to expiration then maybe< maybe another 10 days later it touches maybe another 10 days later it touches the< the strike price again then you got to the strike price again then you got to roll< roll up maybe this time you have to go roll up maybe this time you have to go up< up to maybe 85 days up to maybe 85 days and< and then maybe if the market rallies and then maybe if the market rallies again< again you have to roll up all the way to again you have to roll up all the way to i< i don't know maybe like 180 days so at i don't know maybe like 180 days so at this< this point of time you'll be stuck with this point of time you'll be stuck with a< a covered call that has 180 days to go a covered call that has 180 days to go so< so what this does is that it actually so what this does is that it actually limits limits limits your your your your< your profits because your profits because you< you have to hold on to this cover call you have to hold on to this cover call for< for 180 days now from here it is for 180 days now from here it is possible< possible that the stock can just really possible that the stock can just really above< above this point now at this point if above this point now at this point if you're< you're really up again you want to roll you're really up again you want to roll it's< it's going to get a little bit too far it's going to get a little bit too far out< out then you'll be holding on to this out then you'll be holding on to this cover< cover call position for the next 100 odd cover call position for the next 100 odd days< days where the maximum profit you can days where the maximum profit you can make< make is just this two points down here make is just this two points down here from< from here to here so this is the from here to here so this is the downside< downside of uh rolling out and up once downside of uh rolling out and up once your< your strike is breached but on the your strike is breached but on the bright< bright side is that bright side is that you< you you really kind of avoid being you you really kind of avoid being locked< locked in a loss from where you first locked in a loss from where you first bought< bought it your 100 shares to your cover bought it your 100 shares to your cover call< call all right so that's for this method call all right so that's for this method of< of rolling now the next method will be of rolling now the next method will be to< to roll out and up once the delta is to roll out and up once the delta is roughly< roughly 0. 8 deltas right so 0.

8 roughly 0. 8 deltas right so 0.

8 basically< basically you will be letting the price basically you will be letting the price get< get in the money get in the money all< all right getting the stock price that all right getting the stock price that your< your cover call be in the money your cover call be in the money and< and then uh what this does is that and then uh what this does is that you're< you're actually giving room for the you're actually giving room for the stock< stock to come back down stock to come back down because because because there's< there's always a chance that you know there's always a chance that you know the< the market could go up and then it comes the market could go up and then it comes back< back down again later so this way it back down again later so this way it could< could actually expire out of the money could actually expire out of the money at< at expiration and there's no need for at expiration and there's no need for you< you to adjust your cover call so you you to adjust your cover call so you won't< won't be stuck with a cover call where won't be stuck with a cover call where you< you know you have still have 180 days you know you have still have 180 days left< left to go left to go but< but the risk is that you could lock in a but the risk is that you could lock in a loss< loss if the stock rallies too high right loss if the stock rallies too high right if< if it rallies too high down here at this if it rallies too high down here at this point< point of time point of time you< you realize that you cannot actually you realize that you cannot actually roll< roll out and up instead the only thing roll out and up instead the only thing that< that you can do is to just roll out in that you can do is to just roll out in time< time and keep the same strike price so time and keep the same strike price so what< what happened is that you have what happened is that you have essentially< essentially just locked in the losses essentially just locked in the losses. at< at this strike price until the price do at this strike price until the price do eventually< eventually come down right if it does eventually come down right if it does come< come down and then your cover call just come down and then your cover call just nice< nice is in a profit you can always close nice is in a profit you can always close it< it out right so it out right so there< there are two methods and there's no one there are two methods and there's no one that< that is better than the other it always that is better than the other it always comes< comes down to what the market does right comes down to what the market does right what< what the market does then you know by what the market does then you know by looking< looking back you will know that this looking back you will know that this might< might be the better one or maybe this might be the better one or maybe this might< might be the better one we never know so might be the better one we never know so if< if you want to be safer you want to go if you want to be safer you want to go for< for this one right roll once it touches for this one right roll once it touches your< your strike price roll out and up your strike price roll out and up if< if you want to maximize the if you want to maximize the extrinsic< extrinsic value that you get from the extrinsic value that you get from the cover< cover call and you don't mind getting cover call and you don't mind getting out< out for a loss especially you know if out for a loss especially you know if maybe< maybe the cover calls maybe the cover calls is< is pretty near your your is pretty near your your shares< shares right maybe the cover call is shares right maybe the cover call is somewhere< somewhere here then you can you know somewhere here then you can you know just< just let the stock just go into just let the stock just go into your< your cover call let it go in the money your cover call let it go in the money around< around 0. 8 then you can start to see around 0.

8 then you can start to see where< where they can roll out and up all right where they can roll out and up all right now< now the alternative to just selling a now the alternative to just selling a normal< normal cover call is that you could normal cover call is that you could actually< actually sell a cover call ratio spread actually sell a cover call ratio spread now< now i've already created a video on this now i've already created a video on this i< i call it the enhanced cover call i call it the enhanced cover call you< you can watch this in my channel i'll you can watch this in my channel i'll put< put a link also as well at the top right put a link also as well at the top right hand< hand of this video so for the cover call hand of this video so for the cover call ratio< ratio spread ratio spread basically< basically what it is is selling a cover basically what it is is selling a cover call< call and then having an embedded long call and then having an embedded long call< call spread right you have an embedded call spread right you have an embedded long< long call spread down here and then you long call spread down here and then you sell< sell the cover call at this same strike sell the cover call at this same strike price< price so basically this cover call the price so basically this cover call the premium< premium which you receive is meant to premium which you receive is meant to finance< finance this long call spread so if you finance this long call spread so if you sold< sold the cover call let's say for two sold the cover call let's say for two dollars< dollars then you can buy a debit spread dollars then you can buy a debit spread a< a long call spread for less than two a long call spread for less than two dollars< dollars right maybe you can buy it for a dollars right maybe you can buy it for a dollar< dollar and 80 cents so this way net net dollar and 80 cents so this way net net you< you will have a premium of 20 cents you will have a premium of 20 cents right< right you'll collect 20 cents it's not right you'll collect 20 cents it's not much< much but the difference with this and a much but the difference with this and a normal< normal cover call is that you do get to normal cover call is that you do get to get< get the profits from the underlying uh get the profits from the underlying uh capital< capital gains or the profits from this capital gains or the profits from this long< long debit spread so as you can see long debit spread so as you can see that< that this loan debit spread is roughly that this loan debit spread is roughly about< about five points which means to say you about five points which means to say you can< can make five dollars on this spread so can make five dollars on this spread so if< if the market is to go above and closes if the market is to go above and closes above< above your cover call strike price your above your cover call strike price your shares< shares will be called away at a loss of shares will be called away at a loss of five< five dollars right you can see down here five dollars right you can see down here 105< 105 to 100 is a loss of five dollars but 105 to 100 is a loss of five dollars but do< do not forget because you have. this long do not forget because you have this long call< call spread you're also making five call spread you're also making five dollars< dollars so which means to say they dollars so which means to say they actually< actually net net becomes zero actually net net becomes zero which< which means to say you could actually which means to say you could actually get< get out of this whole position get out of this whole position for< for scratch you could even get you know for scratch you could even get you know whatever< whatever profits right whatever payment whatever profits right whatever payment you< you have you have for< for selling this cover call for selling this cover call ratio< ratio spread so what you want to do ratio spread so what you want to do ideally< ideally for this ideally for this is< is to match the cover call ratio spread is to match the cover call ratio spread max< max profit which is more than or equal max profit which is more than or equal to< to the loss on the underlying stock if to the loss on the underlying stock if the< the cover calls the sign so the cover calls the sign so in< in this case compared to the cover call in this case compared to the cover call right< right if you see in the previous slide right if you see in the previous slide our< our covered call has to be somewhere our covered call has to be somewhere here< here or above this and if it's called here or above this and if it's called away< away then we'll be at least at a scratch away then we'll be at least at a scratch or< or a profit but for the cover call ratio or a profit but for the cover call ratio spread< spread we can have the additional short spread we can have the additional short call< call which is the cover call portion call which is the cover call portion below< below our entry price below our entry price and< and we can have it caught away at this and we can have it caught away at this price< price because we also have an embedded price because we also have an embedded long< long spread that covers the loss from long spread that covers the loss from this< this point where we bought it to where this point where we bought it to where the< the shares will be called away if it's the shares will be called away if it's in< in the money and expiration right so for in the money and expiration right so for the< the cover call ratio spread you want the the cover call ratio spread you want the stock< stock to go up past your cover call stock to go up past your cover call strike< strike to make money on your embedded strike to make money on your embedded long< long call spread so this is an long call spread so this is an alternative< alternative to selling the cover call alternative to selling the cover call all< all right guys so that's it for this all right guys so that's it for this video< video i hope you find this video helpful video i hope you find this video

=====================================================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video I all right alrighty so in today's video I have< have the profit update of the income have the profit update of the income grid< grid wheel strategy that I did on Amazon grid wheel strategy that I did on Amazon right< right in the last video now you've ever right in the last video now you've ever watched< watched the last video please go ahead watched the last video please go ahead and< and watch that video first so you can and watch that video first so you can follow< follow along I'll put the link in the follow along I'll put the link in the top< top right hand corner of this video so top right hand corner of this video so you< you can go ahead and click that and you can go ahead and click that and watch< watch that first so in this video Amazon watch that first so in this video Amazon has< has gone up quite a bit since the last has gone up quite a bit since the last video< video I recorded So I've got a number of video I recorded So I've got a number of requests< requests to you know just record an requests to you know just record an update< update and along the way I've taken some update and along the way I've taken some profit< profit as well also I want to share with profit as well also I want to share with you< you uh what has happened all right so you uh what has happened all right so let's< let's Dive Right In so as you can see let's Dive Right In so as you can see this< this was where we last left off in the this was where we last left off in the last< last video so at that point in time last video so at that point in time uh< uh we have been exercised right we've uh we have been exercised right we've been< been assigned on the 100 shares at 85 so been assigned on the 100 shares at 85 so at< at this point we have 200 shares right at this point we have 200 shares right we< we have 100 shares at 85 and then we we have 100 shares at 85 and then we have< have another 100 shares at 90 and since have another 100 shares at 90 and since then< then uh Amazon as you can see have then uh Amazon as you can see have really< really rallied right it's gone up quite really rallied right it's gone up quite a< a bit and this is where you can really a bit and this is where you can really start< start to take some profits off the table start to take some profits off the table right< right you can sell cover calls and I'm right you can sell cover calls and I'm going< going to share with you the decision uh going to share with you the decision uh making< making process that I went through as making process that I went through as the< the market went up all right so let's go the market went up all right so let's go back< back a little bit to where we last left back a little bit to where we last left off< off in the last video so in the last off in the last video so in the last video< video it was mostly just cash secure video it was mostly just cash secure outputs< outputs right because the market outputs right because the market basically< basically has just gone down right it basically has just gone down right it hasn't< hasn't really rallied up that much right hasn't really rallied up that much right compared< compared to how it is right now so in compared to how it is right now so in this< this video I'm going to be sharing with this video I'm going to be sharing with you< you the cover call so now at this point you the cover call so now at this point in< in time where the market in time where the market right< right it's roughly around 82 dollars right it's roughly around 82 dollars plus< plus after you've got a sign of 100 plus after you've got a sign of 100 shares< shares you can actually choose to sell a shares you can actually choose to sell a cover< cover call so that uh some people that cover call so that uh some people that you< you know they all they want to do is you know they all they want to do is they< they just want to sell cover calls at they just want to sell cover calls at the< the same strike price which they got the same strike price which they got assigned< assigned right so they got assigned 85 assigned right so they got assigned 85 they< they want to sell the cover call and they want to sell the cover call and there's< there's absolutely. no problems with that there's absolutely no problems with that right< right so what you're essentially doing right so what you're essentially doing is< is you're just trying to get the is you're just trying to get the premiums< premiums you're just getting premiums premiums you're just getting premiums over< over and over again and you just don't over and over again and you just don't care< care about the capital gains right care about the capital gains right capital< capital gains is where you know if you capital gains is where you know if you assign< assign an 85 and you sell the stock at assign an 85 and you sell the stock at anywhere< anywhere above 85 you're going to have anywhere above 85 you're going to have capital< capital gains on top of the premiums capital gains on top of the premiums which< which you receive for selling they cover which you receive for selling they cover calls< calls so at this point of time let's say calls so at this point of time let's say you< you decide that you know you just want you decide that you know you just want to< to get the extrinsic value because to get the extrinsic value because you're< you're afraid that you know the market you're afraid that you know the market might< might just continue to go down and you might just continue to go down and you want< want to quickly get you know whatever want to quickly get you know whatever premiums< premiums that you can get you know to premiums that you can get you know to cushion< cushion this downfall and the prices you cushion this downfall and the prices you could< could actually do that as well so if you could actually do that as well so if you were< were to pull out all the call options at were to pull out all the call options at this< this point of time you can see that this point of time you can see that there< there are a number of choices right so there are a number of choices right so the< the strike price which you want to go the strike price which you want to go for< for will be 85 because that's the price for will be 85 because that's the price you< you would have get assigned at right so you would have get assigned at right so 85< 85 you can see that there are many 85 you can see that there are many different< different choices right so which one do different choices right so which one do you< you want to go for and here's the short you want to go for and here's the short answer< answer there is no right or wrong right answer there is no right or wrong right you're< you're still going to get the premium you're still going to get the premium you're< you're still going to make the money so you're still going to make the money so as< as long as Amazon goes up in the long as long as Amazon goes up in the long term< term you're going to be making all this term you're going to be making all this premium premium premium this< this income as long as you know you just this income as long as you know you just keep< keep doing them consistently so at this keep doing them consistently so at this point< point of time which one do you want to point of time which one do you want to sell< sell so here are a few insights all sell so here are a few insights all right< right for you on how I decide which one right for you on how I decide which one to< to sell so first off you may want to to sell so first off you may want to consider< consider you know selling the one which consider you know selling the one which has< has the highest Roi right some people has the highest Roi right some people want< want to say that you know I want to get want to say that you know I want to get the< the highest return the bank for the buck the highest return the bank for the buck on< on my investment so if you want to go on my investment so if you want to go for< for that this is how you want to for that this is how you want to calculate< calculate the ROI so first of all you calculate the ROI so first of all you want< want to take the premium so let's say want to take the premium so let's say for< for example you you take the one where for example you you take the one where there's< there's one days you know there's one there's one days you know there's one day< day left to expiration so that's about day left to expiration so that's about 39< 39 cents all right so you take the uh 39 cents all right so you take the uh 0. 39 0.

39 0. 39 and< and then you just divide it off by the and then you just divide it off by the strike< strike which is 85 and then what you strike which is 85 and then what you want< want to do is divide by the number of want to do is divide by the number of days< days to expiration right so in this case days to expiration right so in this case that's< that's just one days left so one day that's just one days left so one day left< left there's no need to divide it and left there's no need to divide it and you< you just times 365 days so as you can you just times 365 days so as you can see< see this is roughly see this is roughly 167< 167 percent return right 167 return is 167 percent return right 167 return is really< really a lot right if you think about it really a lot right if you think about it on< on an analyzed basis but then you need on an analyzed basis but then you need to< to think that all you're receiving is to think that all you're receiving is just< just forty dollars for this one time now just forty dollars for this one time now what< what if the market continues to go all what if the market continues to go all the< the way down let's say for example if the way down let's say for example if the< the market kind of really tanks after the market kind of really tanks after that< that then you would have kind of regret that then you would have kind of regret that< that you didn't sell you know further that you didn't sell you know further days< days to expression the further one where days to expression the further one where you< you get more premium right because you you get more premium right because you could< could only sell this once at this moment could only sell this once at this moment right< right there's just a forty dollars but right there's just a forty dollars but if< if you assort the one at uh you know the if you assort the one at uh you know the 29< 29 days to expiration you'd get 436 29 days to expiration you'd get 436 dollars< dollars right 436 dollars per contract dollars right 436 dollars per contract and< and this is actually quite a juicy and this is actually quite a juicy premium< premium compared to the one which premium compared to the one which there's< there's one day right and the other there's one day right and the other thing< thing that might happen is if the market thing that might happen is if the market was< was to really just shoot up which you was to really just shoot up which you know< know eventually did right so in this know eventually did right so in this case< case again you would have your shares case again you would have your shares most< most likely called away at 85 strike most likely called away at 85 strike price< price but then the only premium which price but then the only premium which you< you receive is just 39 right when you you receive is just 39. right when you could< could have maybe gotten more right 436 could have maybe gotten more right 436 but< but then of course you know the market but then of course you know the market could< could have gone down back then by then could have gone down back then by then but< but hey at least you have gotten 436 but hey at least you have gotten 436 dollars< dollars in terms of Premium so these are dollars in terms of Premium so these are things< things that you really want to take into things that you really want to take into consideration< consideration when you're you know consideration when you're you know choosing< choosing the right uh strike for you choosing the right uh strike for you right< right again there is no best strike right again there is no best strike right< right because you never know what the right because you never know what the market< market is going to do right the only market is going to do right the only time< time I would say that you know this one time I would say that you know this one day< day left is good if you were to sell at day left is good if you were to sell at the< the same strike which you got assigned the same strike which you got assigned is< is if the market just stays somewhere is if the market just stays somewhere around< around here right you just stay around here right you just stay somewhere< somewhere around here in the next few somewhere around here in the next few days< days and then after this expires you can days and then after this expires you can sell< sell it again right you can just keep sell it again right you can just keep selling< selling and selling and selling it over selling and selling and selling it over one< one day over and over again or the next one day over and over again or the next expiration< expiration date once this expire for you expiration date once this expire for you to< to keep getting the highest return on to keep getting the highest return on your< your investment the highest Roi so we your investment the highest Roi so we never< never know what's going to happen you never know what's going to happen you just< just want to choose one that you feel just want to choose one that you feel comfortable< comfortable with all right so let's take comfortable with all right so let's take a< a look about the the ROI for the second a look about the the ROI for the second one< one as you notice that as more days one as you notice that as more days there< there is left to expiration the ROI will there is left to expiration the ROI will actually< actually drop so that's kind of a actually drop so that's kind of a trade-off< trade-off you get higher premium but you trade-off you get higher premium but you get< get a lower Roi compared you know to the get a lower Roi compared you know to the shorter< shorter DTE option so let's take a look shorter DTE option so let's take a look at< at this one so you take 1.

68 and then at this one so you take 1. 68 and then you< you divide it by the strike price 85 so you divide it by the strike price 85 so this< this time you divide it by number of. this time you divide it by number of days< days left which is eight then you times days left which is eight then you times 365< 365 days you get 90.

17 which is pretty 365 days you get 90. 17 which is pretty good< good as well and let's take a look at good as well and. let's take a look at the< the last one the last one all< all right so you get 4.

36 and then you all right so you get 4. 36 and then you divided< divided it by the same the strike price divided it by the same the strike price you< you divide by the data expression that's. you divide by the data expression that's 29< 29 and you times 365 that gives you a 29 and you times 365 that gives you a return< return of 64.

55 as you can see the ROI return of 64. 55 as you can see the ROI drops< drops off although you get slightly more drops off although you get slightly more premium< premium so there's no right or wrong premium so there's no right or wrong answer< answer you choose one which you are answer you choose one which you are comfortable< comfortable with and you can live with comfortable with and you can live with you< you know depending on where the market you know depending on where the market goes< goes after that all right so for me I goes after that all right so for me I did< did not choose to sell the Coca-Cola 85 did not choose to sell the Coca-Cola 85 because< because if you ever seen my last video because if you ever seen my last video my< my plan was to sell it at every uh my plan was to sell it at every uh interval< interval right and if every grid interval right and if every grid interval< interval so this income grid interval is interval so this income grid interval is five< five dollars so what I want is that when five dollars so what I want is that when I< I get a sign of this I want to sell my I get a sign of this I want to sell my 85< 85 strike shares at 90 and those at 90 85 strike shares at 90 and those at 90 dollars< dollars that have been assigned is 100 dollars that have been assigned is 100 shares< shares I want to sell at 95 so this way shares I want to sell at 95 so this way not< not only do I get the cover call not only do I get the cover call premiums< premiums I also have a chance to get a premiums I also have a chance to get a capital< capital gain of the difference capital gain of the difference right< right of these strike prices so in this right of these strike prices so in this case< case it's five dollars different so that case it's five dollars different so that is< is 500 uh if my shares get called away is 500 uh if my shares get called away at< at the next uh level all right so again at the next uh level all right so again for< for this there are always trade-offs for this there are always trade-offs right< right it's not saying that this is right it's not saying that this is better< better it's just that you know I think better it's just that you know I think that< that Amazon right now is pretty that Amazon right now is pretty undervalued< undervalued and at the same time the undervalued and at the same time the stochastics< stochastics which is not shown here is stochastics which is not shown here is actually< actually pretty oversold so I know actually pretty oversold so I know there's< there's some sort of a bounce that is there's some sort of a bounce that is due< due soon and if I expect that there's due soon and if I expect that there's going< going to be a bounce that's due soon why going to be a bounce that's due soon why would< would I just want to sell it at the would I just want to sell it at the price< price where I got assigned when there's price where I got assigned when there's a< a chance I can get it you know at a a chance I can get it you know at a higher< higher price right so this is my higher price right so this is my consideration< consideration when I did it now of consideration when I did it now of course< course I could be wrong right the market course I could be wrong right the market could< could go down and then I would have could go down and then I would have regretted< regretted you know not selling at this regretted you know not selling at this or< or rather I would have gotten at least or rather I would have gotten at least more< more premium if I had sold it at this more premium if I had sold it at this strike< strike price at 85 right so at the end strike price at 85 right so at the end of< of the day again it comes down to where of the day again it comes down to where the< the market is all right so the market is all right so as< as you can see the market rallied all as you can see the market rallied all the< the way to 90 dollars so this is where I the way to 90 dollars so this is where I took< took a look at the cover calls and this took a look at the cover calls and this is< is where I decided to you know sell my is where I decided to you know sell my cover< cover call so again I'm faced with three cover call so again I'm faced with three choices< choices right you have the three days choices right you have the three days you< you have the 10 days and you have the 31 you have the 10 days and you have the 31 days< days which one do you want to go for days which one do you want to go for right< right so for me the decision which I right so for me the decision which I made< made I actually went for the shortest made I actually went for the shortest one< one I went for this one and if you one I went for this one and if you notice< notice in my previous video I actually notice in my previous video I actually chose< chose you know for the cashier cupboard chose you know for the cashier cupboard I< I chose the second uh nearest expiration I chose the second uh nearest expiration date date date right< right instead of the first one but for right instead of the first one but for the< the cover calls I chose the shortest one the cover calls I chose the shortest one and< and the reason is because well firstly and the reason is because well firstly if< if you can see the premium difference is if you can see the premium difference is not< not that great right so as you can see not that great right so as you can see for< for this for three days you receive 190 for this for three days you receive 190 dollars< dollars but for 10 days right which is dollars but for 10 days right which is roughly< roughly three times right of this uh roughly three times right of this uh days< days to expiration days to expiration I< I only received 257 or rather I would I only received 257 or rather I would only< only get you know 257 dollars that is only get you know 257 dollars that is much< much lesser than twice when I should be much lesser than twice when I should be getting< getting at least three times this getting at least three times this premium< premium so there's not much difference premium so there's not much difference so< so the other thing that the reason that so the other thing that the reason that I< I chose this is because right now I I chose this is because right now I don't< don't just have the premium of this don't just have the premium of this cover< cover call that I'm going to receive I'm cover call that I'm going to receive I'm also< also going to receive the capital gain also going to receive the capital gain from< from 85 to 90 dollars and as much as from 85 to 90 dollars and as much as possible< possible I want to capture this profit possible I want to capture this profit right< right because this is a pretty big right because this is a pretty big profit< profit compared to the premium which I'm profit compared to the premium which I'm going< going to receive going to receive so< so the last thing I want is for the so the last thing I want is for the market< market to go back down again when I market to go back down again when I already< already had a chance to sell it at a already had a chance to sell it at a profit< profit for the capital gain side so I profit for the capital gain side so I wanted< wanted to get out of this position as wanted to get out of this position as quickly< quickly as possible to realize these quickly as possible to realize these capital< capital gains so that is my first capital gains so that is my first priority< priority right so that is why I chose priority right so that is why I chose the< the shorter days to expiration now if the shorter days to expiration now if you< you wanted to choose the longer ones you wanted to choose the longer ones right< right because if you believe that the right because if you believe that the market< market is still going to go up all the market is still going to go up all the way< way in the next 30 days then there's way in the next 30 days then there's nothing< nothing wrong going for the 31 days you nothing wrong going for the 31 days you get< get 555 so you get 555 on top of the get 555 so you get 555 on top of the capital< capital gains of five dollars right so capital gains of five dollars right so all< all comes down to your own expectations all comes down to your own expectations you< you have in Market I chose the shorter you have in Market I chose the shorter one< one all right so in this case I actually one all right so in this case I actually put< put a limit order for two dollars put a limit order for two dollars because< because I wasn't able to stay because I wasn't able to stay or< or rather stay at the market throughout or rather stay at the market throughout the< the whole Market all right close right the whole Market all right close right at< at the open of the market I only trade at the open of the market I only trade for< for like an hour or two it didn't reach for like an hour or two it didn't reach this< this price I just put a limit order and this price I just put a limit order and I< I wake up to see if I get filled or I wake up to see if I get filled or whether< whether it does not get filled so in whether it does not get filled so in this< this case I only got filled the day this case I only got filled the day after< after right when the market uh showed up after right when the market uh showed up after< after that so that's where I got filled after that so that's where I got filled so< so I sold a cover call at a 90 strike so I sold a cover call at a 90 strike price< price at this uh two dollars in terms of price at this uh two dollars in terms of Premium< Premium with three days left to go by Premium with three days left to go by the< the way if this video has been helpful the way if this video has been helpful to< to you so far I'd really appreciate if to you so far I'd really appreciate if you< you hit the thumbs up button and also you hit the thumbs up button and also subscribe< subscribe to my channel so I can create subscribe to my channel so I can create more< more videos like this for you in the more videos like this for you in the future< future all right back to the video okay future all right back to the video okay so< so as you can see uh I got filled at the so as you can see uh I got filled at the next< next day right the next day you can see next day right the next day you can see the< the market really shut up went all the the market really shut up went all the way< way to 95 so at this point of time it way to 95 so at this point of time it actually< actually gave me the opportunity to sell actually gave me the opportunity to sell my< my NYX covered call right so the next my NYX covered call right so the next cover< cover call cover call that< that assault will be at 95 strike price that assault will be at 95 strike price and< and this time I'm able to get at the and this time I'm able to get at the same< same day still expiration the same date same day still expiration the same date of< of expiration of expiration and< and that's two days left to go so you and that's two days left to go so you can< can see the market really did a u-turn can see the market really did a u-turn uh< uh very strong rally uh in the next few uh very strong rally uh in the next few days< days after we got assigned all right so days after we got assigned all right so again< again down here there are a few choices again down here there are a few choices that< that you can go for so again for this I that you can go for so again for this I went< went for the shortest expiration date went for the shortest expiration date because< because I want to get uh exercised or because I want to get uh exercised or rather< rather I want to have my shares called rather I want to have my shares called the< the way at 95 so this way I also gained the way at 95 so this way I also gained the< the capital gains from 90 to 95 and I the capital gains from 90 to 95 and I have< have two days uh to go for it and at the have two days uh to go for it and at the same< same time if you want to take a look at same time if you want to take a look at the< the stochastics which is not. shown here the stochastics which is not shown here the< the stochastics is showing that the the stochastics is showing that the market< market is is going into the overbought market is is going into the overbought region< region and there's always a chance that region and there's always a chance that when< when there's such a strong rally right when there's such a strong rally right there< there tends to be you know quite a there tends to be you know quite a little< little bit of a pullback first you know little bit of a pullback first you know before< before eventually the market goes up or before eventually the market goes up or maybe< maybe it goes down right so if I wanted maybe it goes down right so if I wanted to< to get out of my position and I expect to get out of my position and I expect that< that there could be some sort of a that there could be some sort of a pullback< pullback then I want to get out of my pullback then I want to get out of my position< position as quickly as possible because position as quickly as possible because this< this way if the market does really this way if the market does really really< really uh sorry if the market does go really uh sorry if the market does go back< back down back down after< after my shares get called away in the after my shares get called away in the next< next few days then guess what I can next few days then guess what I can again< again sell the premium let me just again sell the premium let me just remove< remove this drawing if the market comes remove this drawing if the market comes uh< uh goes up and then comes back down uh goes up and then comes back down again< again and then I get exercise or I have again and then I get exercise or I have my< my shares called away in time it comes my shares called away in time it comes back< back down I can sell my premium again back down I can sell my premium again the< the cash check output at 90 it goes the cash check output at 90 it goes further< further down I can sell it again at 85 further down I can sell it again at 85 dollars< dollars so this way I'm always trying to dollars so this way I'm always trying to maximize< maximize the premium which I receive maximize the premium which I receive when< when doing this income grid wheel when doing this income grid wheel strategy< strategy so for this I did it at a 95 strategy so for this I did it at a 95 strike< strike price strike price I< I saw the cover call 95 check price and I saw the cover call 95 check price and I< I got two dollars again I just placed a I got two dollars again I just placed a limit< limit order and then I just went away limit order and then I just went away from< from my computer all right so there's no from my computer all right so there's no need< need for you to actually stay in front need for you to actually stay in front of< of the computer because you're not doing of the computer because you're not doing day< day trading right this is not day day trading right this is not day trading< trading this is more of a longer term trading this is more of a longer term mid< mid to a long-term trading strategy all mid to a long-term trading strategy all right< right so I chose the one uh that is at right so I chose the one uh that is at uh< uh 95 strike price at two days and for a uh 95 strike price at two days and for a two< two dollars premium so as you can see two dollars premium so as you can see the< the market continued to rally and at the market continued to rally and at this< this point we got our shares called away this point we got our shares called away so< so that is a very good news for us so that is a very good news for us because< because we managed to get the premiums because we managed to get the premiums on< on top of that we got capital gains from on top of that we got capital gains from 85< 85 to 90 and then we have the capital 85 to 90 and then we have the capital gains< gains as well from 90 to 95 and all you gains as well from 90 to 95 and all you have< have to do right now is just wait for have to do right now is just wait for the< the market to either come back down the market to either come back down before< before we initiate at the 90 again or if before we initiate at the 90 again or if the< the market continues to go up then I may the market continues to go up then I may reassess< reassess the whole situation again and reassess the whole situation again and then< then adjust the income grid alright so then adjust the income grid alright so if< if you've seen in the last video my if you've seen in the last video my income< income grid started at 90 right because income grid started at 90 right because the< the the time when I uh take a look at the the time when I uh take a look at Amazon< Amazon when I decided to do the wheel Amazon when I decided to do the wheel strategy< strategy the price was roughly around strategy the price was roughly around this< this this bar down here right so I this this bar down here right so I really< really until you went

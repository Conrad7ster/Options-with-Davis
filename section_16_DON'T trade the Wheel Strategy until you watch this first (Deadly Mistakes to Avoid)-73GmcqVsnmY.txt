====================================================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be talking about the top I'm going to be talking about the top five< five deest wheel strategy mistakes that five deest wheel strategy mistakes that I< I see many people make right so I've I see many people make right so I've been< been trading the wheel strategy for been trading the wheel strategy for quite< quite some time now and I even shared it quite some time now and I even shared it in< in my own portfolio right what are the in my own portfolio right what are the stocks< stocks that I've been willing and how I stocks that I've been willing and how I trade< trade it so you can definitely just go trade it so you can definitely just go to< to my channel and just look for you know to my channel and just look for you know the< the seven figure portfolio right so I the seven figure portfolio right so I share< share what's inside my portfolio so for share what's inside my portfolio so for the< the wheel strategy if been actually the wheel strategy if been actually doing< doing pretty well for me and the reason doing pretty well for me and the reason is< is because I have been avoiding the is because I have been avoiding the mistakes< mistakes that I'll be mentioning in this mistakes that I'll be mentioning in this video< video so if you two want to do well in video so if you two want to do well in your< your whe strategy and definitely avoid your whe strategy and definitely avoid getting< getting into stocks where it can getting into stocks where it can potentially< potentially go to zero then you potentially go to zero then you definitely< definitely want to watch this video all definitely want to watch this video all right< right so let's Dive Right into this right so let's Dive Right into this starting< starting with the very first mistake and starting with the very first mistake and mistake< mistake number one and that is to just mistake number one and that is to just choose< choose High volatility stocks and not choose High volatility stocks and not profitable< profitable companies so in my opinion profitable companies so in my opinion this< this is the biggest mistake that I see this is the biggest mistake that I see many< many many beginners make right they just many many beginners make right they just go< go for the very high volatility stocks go for the very high volatility stocks because< because they think that it's going to because they think that it's going to give< give you a lot of Premium but the give you a lot of Premium but the problem< problem is that when you go for this problem is that when you go for this High< High volatility stocks is actually High volatility stocks is actually increasing< increasing your risk so many people love increasing your risk so many people love to< to trade the wheel strategy on high to trade the wheel strategy on high volatility< volatility stocks because it gives High volatility stocks because it gives High premiums< premiums now first of all nothing wrong premiums now first of all nothing wrong with< with high volatility stocks if it is with high volatility stocks if it is also< also a profitable company right so if also a profitable company right so if you< you tie these two together that's fine you tie these two together that's fine right< right but if you're only focusing purely right but if you're only focusing purely just< just for the very high volatility right just for the very high volatility right because< because you want to get a lot of because you want to get a lot of premiums< premiums then this is where it can get premiums then this is where it can get into< into a lot of trouble a lot of problems into a lot of trouble a lot of problems later< later on as you trade it right if you're later on as you trade it right if you're just< just focusing on getting as high as just focusing on getting as high as volatility< volatility as you can so as you can see volatility as you can so as you can see this< this is AMC so AMC is a pretty popular this is AMC so AMC is a pretty popular stock< stock right it's one of the M stocks stock right it's one of the M stocks amongst< amongst you know many people trading it amongst you know many people trading it especially< especially those with small Capital especially those with small Capital because< because they can get quite a big premium because they can get quite a big premium right< right so one of the stocks the meme right so one of the stocks the meme stocks< stocks is AMC you have another one down stocks is AMC you have another one down here< here this is Neo as you can see look at here this is Neo as you can see look at the< the volatility down here over 100% for the volatility down here over 100% for most< most of the option uh expiration dates most of the option uh expiration dates right< right and then also gme right the ever right and then also gme right the ever popular< popular gme as you can see over here the popular gme as you can see over here the the< the volatility also pretty high but what the volatility also pretty high but what many< many people don't realize is that the many people don't realize is that the higher< higher the volatility it indicates the higher the volatility it indicates the higher< higher the potential movement of the higher the potential movement of the stock< stock which also means that there is a stock which also means that there is a higher< higher risk right many people just think higher risk right many people just think of< of high volatility as high premium but of high volatility as high premium but they< they don't really understand what does they don't really understand what does it< it actually mean High volatility just it actually mean High volatility just means< means that the range of the stock the means that the range of the stock the movement< movement of the stock for that period movement of the stock for that period will< will be quite big so this is the range will be quite big so this is the range of< of a given stock so if you compare a of a given stock so if you compare a high high high volatility< volatility versus a low volatility versus a low volatility< volatility right you will see that the volatility right you will see that the range< range will differ from this so you get a range will differ from this so you get a higher< higher premium only because the chances higher premium only because the chances of< of the stock actually moving very big is of the stock actually moving very big is higher< higher which means to say let's say for higher which means to say let's say for example< example you get into the stock somewhere example you get into the stock somewhere at< at this level down here right let's say at this level down here right let's say for< for example you're selling a cash secure for example you're selling a cash secure put< put somewhere where here now in the put somewhere where here now in the event< event there's going to be a very big event there's going to be a very big move< move this stock which you chosen with move this stock which you chosen with the< the high volatility can move so much the high volatility can move so much more< more below your cash secure put compared more below your cash secure put compared to< to the one with low volatility because to the one with low volatility because it's< it's going to only move a smaller range it's going to only move a smaller range so< so with a smaller range your loss won't so with a smaller range your loss won't be< be as big compared to a high volatility be as big compared to a high volatility now< now of course if the market shoot all now of course if the market shoot all the< the way up then if you sell a cash C the way up then if you sell a cash C putut< putut then of course it's going to be in putut then of course it's going to be in a< a profit but we must always take into a profit but we must always take into account< account the risk as well right you don't account the risk as well right you don't just< just want to see how much you want to just want to see how much you want to make< make and then you ignore all the risk make and then you ignore all the risk involved< involved with this so this is the involved with this so this is the problem< problem with high volatility stocks and problem with high volatility stocks and one< one of the other major problems is that one of the other major problems is that many< many of this High volatility stocks is many of this High volatility stocks is that< that they are unprofitable companies that they are unprofitable companies right< right so remember whenever we're right so remember whenever we're choosing< choosing any stock it's not just like a choosing any stock it's not just like a name< name or a ticker down there that we're name or a ticker down there that we're just< just trading as a game no because just trading as a game no because whatever< whatever that you're trading every stock whatever that you're trading every stock is< is a company right so either the company is a company right so either the company is< is profitable or not profitable many of is profitable or not profitable many of these< these high volatility stocks are not these high volatility stocks are not profitable< profitable for example AMC right so you profitable for example AMC right so you can< can very easily go to Google Finance and can very easily go to Google Finance and just< just take a look at their income just take a look at their income statement< statement as you can see over here this statement as you can see over here this is< is AMC for the past 5 years they have is AMC for the past 5 years they have not< not been profitable right as you can see not been profitable right as you can see the< the uh orange or rather the yellowish the uh orange or rather the yellowish bar< bar this is the net income and for all bar this is the net income and for all the< the past 5 years it is under zero so the past 5 years it is under zero so this< this company has not been making money this company has not been making money for< for the past 5 years now you might be for the past 5 years now you might be saying< saying oh Davis but the uh net income is saying oh Davis but the uh net income is gradually< gradually getting better right the gradually getting better right the losses< losses getting smaller and smaller yes losses getting smaller and smaller yes that< that may be true but at the moment it's that may be true but at the moment it's still< still a losing money company right the still a losing money company right the company< company is still not profitable so you company is still not profitable so you want< want to wait till at least it turns want to wait till at least it turns profitable< profitable then you can decide okay profitable then you can decide okay maybe< maybe this might be a possible candidate maybe this might be a possible candidate for< for the wheel strategy but at the moment for the wheel strategy but at the moment it's< it's still a losing money company it's it's still a losing money company it's it's< it's not profitable I would suggest not it's not profitable I would suggest not to< to go with AMC now what about Neo so to go with AMC now what about Neo so whenever< whenever I look at a company's income whenever I look at a company's income statement< statement generally what I like to look statement generally what I like to look at< at is increasing revenue and increasing at is increasing revenue and increasing profits< profits right increasing net income but profits right increasing net income but Neo< Neo is a very classic case of Divergence Neo is a very classic case of Divergence where< where you have increasing Revenue but where you have increasing Revenue but you< you have increasing loss as well as you you have increasing loss as well as you can< can see the more they sell their cars can see the more they sell their cars right< right the more cars they sell the more right the more cars they sell the more Revenue< Revenue they make they actually losing Revenue they make they actually losing even< even more money right as you can see even more money right as you can see over< over here this last bit down here they over here this last bit down here they make< make the most Revenue out of the past 5 make the most Revenue out of the past 5 years< years but it's also the biggest loss for years but it's also the biggest loss for the< the past 5 years so if you ask me for my the past 5 years so if you ask me for my opinion< opinion maybe they should just stop opinion maybe they should just stop selling< selling their cars because if they do selling their cars because if they do probably< probably you know this will at least be probably you know this will at least be not< not so bad so as you can see new very not so bad so as you can see new very high< high volage high volage right< right you seen earlier about 100 plus% right you seen earlier about 100 plus% but< but it's not a profitable company now but it's not a profitable company now what< what about gme gme same thing as well what about gme gme same thing as well right< right as you can see for the past 5 right as you can see for the past 5 years< years not really profitable except for years not really profitable except for 2024< 2024 maybe it's potentially going to be 2024 maybe it's potentially going to be in< in a slight profit but the year has not in a slight profit but the year has not closed< closed out yet so we don't really know closed out yet so we don't really know but< but again as you can see the uh revenue but again as you can see the uh revenue is< is a little bit inconsistent right down is a little bit inconsistent right down up< up down so again there are better up down so again there are better candidates< candidates for or the wheel strategy candidates for or the wheel strategy these< these three are not the ones that I will these three are not the ones that I will look< look for when I trade the wheel strategy look for when I trade the wheel strategy so< so when the stock is not a profitable so when the stock is not a profitable company< company it increases the uncertainty and company it increases the uncertainty and risk< risk of the stock and it's actually risk of the stock and it's actually reflected< reflected in the share price movement so reflected in the share price movement so let< let me repeat that because this is very let me repeat that because this is very important< important when the stock is not a important when the stock is not a profitable< profitable company it increases the profitable company it increases the uncertainty< uncertainty and risk of the stock and uncertainty and risk of the stock and it's< it's reflected in the share price it's reflected in the share price movement< movement so as you can see over here movement so as you can see over here this< this is AMC right you can see the AMC is this is. AMC right you can see the AMC is an< an unprofitable company and look at the an unprofitable company and look at the share< share price right it's so erratic maybe share price right it's so erratic maybe if< if you got in to the stock maybe if you got in to the stock maybe sometime< sometime in 2020 right during the sometime in 2020 right during the pandemic< pandemic and then you held on all the pandemic and then you held on all the way< way until the big move up at 2021 then way until the big move up at 2021 then you< you quickly sell it off maybe you're in you quickly sell it off maybe you're in a< a profit but for the most part you can a profit but for the most part you can see< see this is a very difficult to trade see this is a very difficult to trade the< the wheel strategy stock right because the wheel strategy stock right because if< if you were to get into the wheel if you were to get into the wheel strategy< strategy right now man you have no idea strategy right now man you have no idea when< when you're going to get out of the when you're going to get out of the stock< stock so as you can see I'm profitable stock so as you can see I'm profitable company< company reflects in the chart now what company reflects in the chart now what about< about Neil same thing as well right it's about Neil same thing as well right it's not< not a profitable company and towards the not a profitable company and towards the end< end as you can see the price is pretty end as you can see the price is pretty much< much doing not much right going nowhere much doing not much right going nowhere and< and finally gme gme same thing as well and finally gme gme same thing as well again< again all these are meme stocks right again all these are meme stocks right sometimes< sometimes back in 2021 there's this very sometimes back in 2021 there's this very big< big spike so if you got in then and then big spike so if you got in then and then uh< uh you made that profit good for you but uh you made that profit good for you but it's< it's not one of those stocks that I will it's not one of those stocks that I will continue< continue to wield over and over again so continue to wield over and over again so for< for me I prefer staple stocks when I do for me I prefer staple stocks when I do the< the wheel strategy so I can do it over the wheel strategy so I can do it over and< and over again knowing that in the long and over again knowing that in the long term< term at least there's a greater chance term at least there's a greater chance of< of it appreciating than it going of it appreciating than it going sideways< sideways or going all the way down and sideways or going all the way down and being< being bankrupt right so as you can see being bankrupt right so as you can see this< this is gme stock and it's pretty much this is gme stock and it's pretty much doing< doing nothing right just going sideways doing nothing right just going sideways and< and if you ask me this looks more like and if you ask me this looks more like an< an electrocardiogram reading right as an electrocardiogram reading right as you< you can see over here this is the uh you can see over here this is the uh reading< reading when you know they they test reading when you know they they test your< your heartbeat right so if you were to your heartbeat right so if you were to trade< trade gme then I would guess most of the trade gme then I would guess most of the time< time whenever you get into the stock and time whenever you get into the stock and the< the stock is going down then this is the stock is going down then this is where< where you have your heart attack right where you have your heart attack right your< your heart is going to beat much faster your heart is going to beat much faster than< than before so this is not a stock chart than before so this is not a stock chart this< this is an electroc cardiogram reading this is an electroc cardiogram reading chart< chart all right now what if the stock is chart all right now what if the stock is profitable< profitable when the stock is a profitable when the stock is a profitable< profitable company it now decreases the profitable company it now decreases the uncertainty< uncertainty and risk of the stock and is uncertainty and risk of the stock and is also< also reflected in the share price right also reflected in the share price right so< so an example Google right as you can so an example Google right as you can see< see Google doing pretty good increasing see Google doing pretty good increasing Revenue< Revenue net income pretty stable as well Revenue net income pretty stable as well and< and take a look at the share price right and take a look at the share price right over< over the long term it has been over the long term it has been appreciating< appreciating now if the company is appreciating now if the company is profitable< profitable of course there are no profitable of course there are no guarantees< guarantees that it will always go up in guarantees that it will always go up in the< the long term at least the chances of it the long term at least the chances of it going< going bankrupt is not so high right going bankrupt is not so high right because< because it's a profitable company and because it's a profitable company and also< also there is a higher chance a higher also there is a higher chance a higher probability< probability that the company can go up probability that the company can go up in< in the long term especially if the in the long term especially if the earnings< earnings are good they're always making earnings are good they're always making money< money this will reflect in their share money this will reflect in their share price< price now another company Amazon right price now another company Amazon right as< as you can see Amazon increasing Revenue as you can see Amazon increasing Revenue increasing< increasing uh net income except for 2022 increasing uh net income except for 2022 so< so 2022 was an anomaly because they so 2022 was an anomaly because they invested< invested in an electric automaker uh invested in an electric automaker uh Rion< Rion and that kind of suffered during Rion and that kind of suffered during 2022< 2022 the share price got plunged quite a 2022 the share price got plunged quite a bit< bit so uh only that one year but after bit so uh only that one year but after that< that as you can see 2023 is in profit that as you can see 2023 is in profit again< again so Amazon is one of those again so Amazon is one of those companies< companies that I think is also pretty companies that I think is also pretty decent< decent for the wheel strategy and again decent for the wheel strategy and again as< as you can see reflected in the share as you can see reflected in the share price< price so if you want to avoid the price so if you want to avoid the problem< problem whereby you get into a stock and problem whereby you get into a stock and then< then once you're assigned you you fear then once you're assigned you you fear right< right because you're not sure what's right because you're not sure what's going< going to happen is the market going to going to happen is the market going to continue< continue to go all the way down or is it continue to go all the way down or is it going< going to go back up right so if you want going to go back up right so if you want to< to reduce that risk of that happening to reduce that risk of that happening when< when you get into the wheel strategy when you get into the wheel strategy stocks< stocks then definitely go for the stocks then definitely go for the profitable< profitable companies now mistake number profitable companies now mistake number two< two now mistake number two is choosing two now mistake number two is choosing overvalued< overvalued stocks so at this point you overvalued stocks so at this point you might< might be saying hey Davis I went for you might be saying hey Davis I went for you know< know your suggestion to go for know your suggestion to go for profitable< profitable companies but after I got profitable companies but after I got into< into it the stock price still plunged into it the stock price still plunged down< down for quite some time and one of the down for quite some time and one of the reasons< reasons for that is that it could be reasons for that is that it could be overvalued< overvalued right so you could have overvalued right so you could have chosen< chosen the right stock but it is at the chosen the right stock but it is at the wrong< wrong price right so if it's overvalued wrong price right so if it's overvalued then< then chances are that the stock can then chances are that the stock can still< still go down so what I notice is that still go down so what I notice is that over< over time stocks will tend to grad over time stocks will tend to grad usually< usually gravitate to their mean value usually gravitate to their mean value but< but of course right valuation of a stock but of course right valuation of a stock can< can tend to be subjective right can tend to be subjective right depending< depending on how you calculate it and depending on how you calculate it and who< who you ask regarding the valuation who you ask regarding the valuation right< right and what kind of data you use right and what kind of data you use however< however there's still going to be a however there's still going to be a general< general consensus as to how a valuation general consensus as to how a valuation of< of a stock is arrived and with this of a stock is arrived and with this valuation< valuation at the very least it gives us valuation at the very least it gives us a< a rough estimate of where the stock a rough estimate of where the stock price< price can go to right so if we at least price can go to right so if we at least have< have a number evaluation then we can have a number evaluation then we can base< base on that see whether it's overvalue base on that see whether it's overvalue and< and it's undervalue so you could choose and it's undervalue so you could choose a< a good company to do a real strategy on a good company to do a real strategy on but< but if it's overvalued it still could go but if it's overvalued it still could go down< down so to air on the safe s side to down so to air on the safe s side to have< have a margin of safety we want to have a margin of safety we want to choose< choose profitable companies that are choose profitable companies that are currently< currently under value right so the next currently under value right so the next question< question you might ask is so how do I question you might ask is so how do I know< know what a company's valuation is so know what a company's valuation is so this< this a good question and there are this a good question and there are actually< actually already many sites that give actually already many sites that give you< you the valuation of the stock right you the valuation of the stock right they< they give you the valuation for example they give you the valuation for example the< the simply Wall Street so this side is the simply Wall Street so this side is taken< taken from Simply Wall Street as you can taken from Simply Wall Street as you can see< see over here they give you their see over here they give you their valuation< valuation right this is of Amazon Amazon valuation right this is of Amazon Amazon you< you can see the fair value is 336 you can see the fair value is 336 according< according to them current price 186 is according to them current price 186 is undervalue< undervalue so at least based on this undervalue so at least based on this Fair< Fair values I know that there's still Fair values I know that there's still some< some room to the upside right compared some room to the upside right compared to< to imagine if you go to a stock where to imagine if you go to a stock where the< the fair value maybe the fair value is the fair value maybe the fair value is about< about $100 current price 186 then the about $100 current price 186 then the chances< chances of it going up or at least the chances of it going up or at least the upside< upside uh room it can go up is not as upside uh room it can go up is not as high< high right now there are other sites as high right now there are other sites as well< well for example Guru Focus Morning Star well for example Guru Focus Morning Star so< so what if all the different sites give so what if all the different sites give you< you different valuations then you can you different valuations then you can just< just take an aggregate of it right so just take an aggregate of it right so what< what I do is I like to go to a few of what I do is I like to go to a few of the< the sites take a look at the value and the sites take a look at the value and then< then I will give a discounted value as then I will give a discounted value as well< well right so I'll try and find the well right so I'll try and find the lowest< lowest one so let's say for example 336 lowest one so let's say for example 336 is< is the lowest one then I might even is the lowest one then I might even discounted< discounted even further so maybe discounted even further so maybe discount< discount by 10 20% and if it's still discount by 10 20% and if it's still above< above the current price then you know above the current price then you know that< that the current price is under value so that the current price is under value so in< in this case again it give you a margin in this case again it give you a margin of< of safety so even if you get into the of safety so even if you get into the stock< stock at least you know there's still stock at least you know there's still some< some room to go on the upside by the way some room to go on the upside by the way if< if

com blueprint all< all right back to the video now mistake all right back to the video now mistake number< number three is avoiding assignment number three is avoiding assignment right< right this is a big one so a lot of right this is a big one so a lot of people< people actually get into the wheel people actually get into the wheel strategy< strategy not wanting to get assigned strategy not wanting to get assigned which< which is a little bit weird in my which is a little bit weird in my opinion< opinion because the whole idea of the opinion because the whole idea of the wheel< wheel strategy is to sell the cash wheel strategy is to sell the cash secure< secure put to get assigned and then sell secure put to get assigned and then sell the< the cover call so if you're always the cover call so if you're always trying< trying to avoid assignment then you're trying to avoid assignment then you're not< not really trading the wheel strategy not really trading the wheel strategy right< right you might as well just trade the right you might as well just trade the short< short putut by itself right just trade short putut by itself right just trade the< the short putut and then not get into the short putut and then not get into stock< stock positions right that also means stock positions right that also means that< that you have to take loss when it's that you have to take loss when it's time< time to take loss but if you want to time to take loss but if you want to trade< trade the wheel strategy then know that trade the wheel strategy then know that getting< getting assigned is just part of the getting assigned is just part of the strategy< strategy so there are two common things strategy so there are two common things that< that people do to avoid assignment so that people do to avoid assignment so the< the very first one they do is they sell the very first one they do is they sell a< a cash secure put with very low Delta so a cash secure put with very low Delta so maybe< maybe the price right now is somewhere maybe the price right now is somewhere around< around here right around 148 and they around here right around 148 and they might< might sell one that's super far away so might sell one that's super far away so maybe< maybe they go for something like 20 maybe they go for something like 20 Delta< Delta or maybe even 10 Delta now if you Delta or maybe even 10 Delta now if you are< are trading the short putut that means are trading the short putut that means you< you do not plan to get a sign then 20 you do not plan to get a sign then 20 Delta< Delta 30 Delta I think that's fine Delta 30 Delta I think that's fine because< because you're just trading the option because you're just trading the option by< by itself but if you're trading the by itself but if you're trading the wheel< wheel strategy with the whole idea of wheel strategy with the whole idea of actually< actually getting ass signed then 10 to actually getting ass signed then 10 to 20< 20 Delta is not really going to help you 20 Delta is not really going to help you with< with that uh there's two problems with with that uh there's two problems with this< this so problem number one is when you this so problem number one is when you choose< choose a low Delta for your cash SEC choose a low Delta for your cash SEC output< output the return is also going to be output the return is also going to be low< low because remember now there's a low because remember now there's a difference< difference between the short put also difference between the short put also known< known as The Naked put compared to the known as The Naked put compared to the cash< cash output with the cash secut you cash output with the cash secut you already< already have set aside your Capital that already have set aside your Capital that you< you don't mind getting assigned on the you don't mind getting assigned on the stock< stock so your capital outlay is much stock so your capital outlay is much higher< higher so if you're going to choose a higher so if you're going to choose a Delta< Delta that's so low then your return is Delta that's so low then your return is going< going to be very little now if you trade going to be very little now if you trade the< the short put by itself that means the the short put by itself that means the nak< nak put you're trading based on you know nak put you're trading based on you know whatever< whatever the buying power is so of whatever the buying power is so of course< course the return is going to be higher course the return is going to be higher so< so you need to be very clear what is the so you need to be very clear what is the strategy< strategy you're planning to trade so if strategy you're planning to trade so if you're< you're planning to trade the wheel you're planning to trade the wheel strategy< strategy you are going to commit the strategy you are going to commit the capital< capital at least choose a slightly capital at least choose a slightly higher< higher Delta 10 to 20 Delta is just way higher Delta 10 to 20 Delta is just way too< too far away and the second problem with too far away and the second problem with this< this is that if your cash secure put this is that if your cash secure put actually< actually expire worthless it's likely actually expire worthless it's likely because< because the stock has shut up so at this because the stock has shut up so at this point< point a lot of people get excited you point a lot of people get excited you know< know they say oh wow I sold the cash out know they say oh wow I sold the cash out putut< putut and then expired worthless I can putut and then expired worthless I can sell< sell the cash out putut again wow the sell the cash out putut again wow the wheel< wheel strategy is so good but the wheel strategy is so good but the problem< problem is that the market most likely problem is that the market most likely went< went up and if you actually had gotten went up and if you actually had gotten assigned< assigned right let's say for example you assigned right let's say for example you saw< saw the cash output somewhere here and saw the cash output somewhere here and then< then you got yourself assigned now then you got yourself assigned now you're< you're in a share position now the stock you're in a share position now the stock goes< goes up you're going to participate on goes up you're going to participate on the< the upside in terms of your capital the upside in terms of your capital gains< gains this is a big portion of the wheel gains this is a big portion of the wheel strategy< strategy so had you gotten assigned you strategy so had you gotten assigned you would< would have participated in the up move would have participated in the up move but< but because you wanted to you know avoid but because you wanted to you know avoid assignment< assignment you saw one C put that is so assignment you saw one C put that is so far< far away guess what all you did is get far away guess what all you did is get that< that very little premium and then you that very little premium and then you watch< watch the stock fly to the moon and watch the stock fly to the moon and you're< you're not on that boat now the second you're not on that boat now the second way< way that people avoid assignment is to way that people avoid assignment is to keep< keep rolling out and down so rolling out keep rolling out and down so rolling out and< and down is fine but there's a certain and down is fine but there's a certain point< point where you want to actually stop point where you want to actually stop rolling< rolling up and down so if you do it once rolling up and down so if you do it once just< just to get a lower assignment price just to get a lower assignment price that< that means to get your long shares at a that means to get your long shares at a slightly< slightly uh lower price that's fine but slightly uh lower price that's fine but if< if you keep rolling out and down for the if you keep rolling out and down for the whole< whole idea of avoiding assignment then whole idea of avoiding assignment then guess< guess what again it defeats the purpose guess what again it defeats the purpose so< so for example let's say the market came so for example let's say the market came down< down a little bit they touched the cash down a little bit they touched the cash cut< cut put what people will do is that they cut put what people will do is that they will< will roll out and down so right now they will roll out and down so right now they push< push to a lower strike price but they push to a lower strike price but they also< also push out to a further date so when also push out to a further date so when you< you push out to a further date what you push out to a further date what happens< happens is that it takes a longer time happens is that it takes a longer time for< for this option to expire and by the for this option to expire and by the time< time the market could have gone past and time the market could have gone past and then< then gone back up and then you wouldn't then gone back up and then you wouldn't have< have gotten a sign again same thing you have gotten a sign again same thing you would< would have just gotten the premium you would have just gotten the premium you miss< miss on the upside move so what happens miss on the upside move so what happens is< is that when the market comes down again is that when the market comes down again it< it touch the cash output they're just it touch the cash output they're just going< going to keep rolling down and rolling going to keep rolling down and rolling down< down again so again this is the same down again so again this is the same problem< problem if your cash secure put expire problem if your cash secure put expire worthless< worthless it's likely because the stock worthless it's likely because the stock has< has shut up had you gotten a sign you has shut up had you gotten a sign you would< would have participated in the up move would have participated in the up move so< so remember when you're training the so remember when you're training the wheel< wheel strategy the whole idea here is to wheel strategy the whole idea here is to get< get assigned because once you get get assigned because once you get assigned< assigned then this is where you can assigned then this is where you can actually< actually get the capital gains and actually get the capital gains and capital< capital gains I can tell you plays a big capital gains I can tell you plays a big part< part in the wheel strategy and if you part in the wheel strategy and if you choose< choose the stock right in the first part choose the stock right in the first part avoiding< avoiding mistake number one then you're avoiding mistake number one then you're actually< actually going to have quite a bit of actually going to have quite a bit of profits< profits in terms of the capital gains profits in terms of the capital gains now< now mistake number four is ignoring now mistake number four is ignoring potential< potential capital gains so talking about potential capital gains so talking about capital< capital gains just now this is the next capital gains just now this is the next mistake< mistake right so many people trade the mistake right so many people trade the wheel< wheel strategy only wanting to just make wheel strategy only wanting to just make the< the premiums and forgo the capital gains the premiums and forgo the capital gains for< for example you see that this is the for example you see that this is the price< price where you want to get assigned you price where you want to get assigned you don't< don't mind getting assigned so you have don't mind getting assigned so you have to< to cash the putut so now the market has to cash the putut so now the market has gone< gone below your cash secure putut and gone below your cash secure putut and let's< let's say at this point the cash secure let's say at this point the cash secure putut< putut expires now you assigned 100 putut expires now you assigned 100 shares< shares so so far so good but the problem shares so so far so good but the problem now< now is that many people right now start now is that many people right now start to< to sell the cover car exactly at where to sell the cover car exactly at where they< they were assigned right so what this they were assigned right so what this means< means is that you have removed any means is that you have removed any chances< chances of getting capital gains right chances of getting capital gains right because< because once the market shoots back up because once the market shoots back up and< and then it expires your shares get C and then it expires your shares get C away< away guess what you only get the prems away guess what you only get the prems for< for selling the cash SEC putut and the for selling the cash SEC putut and the covered< covered call and you miss this whole covered call and you miss this whole gain< gain upward so again no capital gains gain upward so again no capital gains down< down there so what you want to do down there so what you want to do instead< instead is wait until the price actually instead is wait until the price actually goes< goes up right and then two ways you can goes up right and then two ways you can do< do it either wait until the stochastics do it either wait until the stochastics oscillator< oscillator is overbought then you start oscillator is overbought then you start to< to sell the cover call or wait until it to sell the cover call or wait until it reaches< reaches its value right the valuation reaches its value right the valuation like< like I mentioned in mistake number two like I mentioned in mistake number two so< so this way at least you can secure some so this way at least you can secure some capital< capital gains which again can play a capital gains which again can play a very< very big part in your profits in terms very big part in your profits in terms of< of the wheel strategy so like I of the wheel strategy so like I mentioned< mentioned not many people realize that mentioned not many people realize that capital< capital gains is actually the biggest capital gains is actually the biggest potential< potential profit portion of the wheel potential profit portion of the wheel strategy< strategy and if you didn't make mistake strategy and if you didn't make mistake number< number one and did your due delions on number one and did your due delions on choosing< choosing the right stock in the first choosing the right stock in the first place< place then you actually don't have to place then you actually don't have to worry< worry about the stock not coming back up worry about the stock not coming back up so< so one of the reasons why a lot of so one of the reasons why a lot of people< people want to sell the cover call at people want to sell the cover call at the< the price which they were assigned was the price which they were assigned was because< because they fear that the stock is because they fear that the stock is never< never going to go back up right they never going to go back up right they fear< fear that the stock is just going to fear that the stock is just going to continue< continue to go down or maybe come back continue to go down or maybe come back UPS< UPS sideways and then they're going to UPS sideways and then they're going to sell< sell the cover call right but if again sell the cover call right but if again you< you chose the right stock then in the you chose the right stock then in the long< long term the stock will go up and then long term the stock will go up and then this< this is where capital gains can really this is where capital gains can really come< come in to help increase your returns come in to help increase your returns now< now the final mistake mistake number now the final mistake mistake number five< five and this is the one that I also get five and this is the one that I also get quite< quite a lot of questions on is selling quite a lot of questions on is selling your< your cover call below your entry price your cover call below your entry price so< so many people sell their cover call so many people sell their cover call below< below entry price hoping to further below entry price hoping to further reduce< reduce their cost right so let's say for reduce their cost. right so let's say for example< example this is where you got assigned example this is where you got assigned the< the 100 shares and then the market the 100 shares and then the market starts< starts to go down from where your entry starts to go down from where your entry price< price is in terms of where you assign price is in terms of where you assign the< the 100 shares so a lot of people panic the 100 shares so a lot of people panic down< down here so the want to quickly try and down here so the want to quickly try and reduce< reduce the cost of this uh shares by reduce the cost of this uh shares by keep< keep on selling this covered call and keep on selling this covered call and this< this is what they do right so they sell this is what they do right so they sell the< the cover call below their entry price the cover call below their entry price now< now all this is good if it continues to now all this is good if it continues to trade< trade down here and you know your cover trade down here and you know your cover call< call never really gets tested and over call never really gets tested and over time< time this really helps to reduce your uh time this really helps to reduce your uh cost< cost of this 100 shares which you got cost of this 100 shares which you got assign< assign down here however one of the big assign down here however one of the big risk< risk is what if the market just suddenly risk is what if the market just suddenly starts< starts to shoot up which can happen and starts to shoot up which can happen and if< if the market starts to shoot up the if the market starts to shoot up the problem< problem is that they can't really roll problem is that they can't really roll the< the cover car anymore many people think the cover car anymore many people think that< that they can just keep rolling the that they can just keep rolling the cover< cover call up and out once the stock cover call up and out once the stock goes< goes up to their cover call but you will goes up to their cover call but you will find< find if it hits too quickly and the move find if it hits too quickly and the move is< is too fast then it's very hard for you is too fast then it's very hard for you to< to roll up and out your cover call and to roll up and out your cover call and when< when they can't do that now what when they can't do that now what happened< happened is that you're stuck with a happened is that you're stuck with a cover< cover call that is below your entry cover call that is below your entry price< price and finally when the cover call price and finally when the cover call gets< gets assigned guess what your shares get gets assigned guess what your shares get CAU< CAU away at a price lower than where you CAU away at a price lower than where you entered< entered which means to say this uh gap entered which means to say this uh gap down< down here is your loss because what you down here is your loss because what you have< have essentially done is that you have have essentially done is that you have bought< bought at this price and you sold at bought at this price and you sold at this< this price giving you a capital loss so this price giving you a capital loss so don't< don't even talk about getting capital don't even talk about getting capital gains< gains right now you even have Capital gains right now you even have Capital loss< loss so it's very important to be loss so it's very important to be patient< patient when you're Trading wheel patient when you're Trading wheel strategy< strategy and not always feel the urge strategy and not always feel the urge thinking< thinking that you must be selling thinking that you must be selling something< something all the time it's not something all the time it's not necessarily< necessarily true you can just hold on to necessarily true you can just hold on to the< the stock wait until it finally goes the stock wait until it finally goes back< back up and then you start to sell the back up and then you start to sell the cover< cover call so again all this comes down cover call so again all this comes down to< to choosing the right stock so if you to choosing the right stock so if you had< had already chosen the right stock at had already chosen the right stock at the< the start especially if the stock is the start especially if the stock is profitable< profitable and you've seen that over the profitable and you've seen that over the past< past 10 years maybe even 20 years the past 10 years maybe even 20 years the stock< stock has always been going up even stock has always been going up even after< after market crashes then you have after market crashes then you have lesser< lesser reason for you to worry right you lesser reason for you to worry right you only< only worry if you start to choose those only worry if you start to choose those stocks< stocks where it's not profitable and stocks where it's not profitable and it's< it's very high volatility and you just it's very high volatility and you just enter< enter it because you hear that the enter it because you hear that the premiums< premiums are so high so what do you do premiums are so high so what do you do if< if the stock is now below the entry if the stock is now below the entry price< price and then you cannot really sell price and then you cannot really sell the< the cover call at or above the entry the cover call at or above the entry price< price well you have two options the very price well you have two options the very first< first option number one is simply do first option number one is simply do nothing< nothing if you have chosen the right nothing if you have chosen the right stock< stock in the first place and believe in stock in the first place and believe in the< the fundamentals of the company just the fundamentals of the company just wait< wait for it to go go up before selling wait for it to go go up before selling the< the covered call so again like I the covered call so again like I mentioned< mentioned all this all ties back to mentioned all this all ties back to choosing< choosing the right stock the whole choosing the right stock the whole success< success of wheel strategy really just success of wheel strategy really just comes< comes down to choosing the right stock comes down to choosing the right stock now< now if option one doesn't work for you now if option one doesn't work for you then< then you need to go for option two which then you need to go for option two which is< is to close the position for a loss when is to close the position for a loss when do< do you do this when you are no longer do you do this when you are no longer confident< confident in the stock and you don't confident in the stock and you don't believe< believe in the company's fundamentals believe in the company's fundamentals then< then there is absolutely no point then there is absolutely no point holding< holding on to the stock and hoping it holding on to the stock and hoping it goes< goes up because if you don't truly goes up because if you don't truly believe< believe in a stock you don't think that believe in a stock you don't think that you< you know in the long term it's going to you know in the long term it's going to go< go up to its valuation then get out of go up to its valuation then get out of it< it right because no point for you to it right because no point for you to hope< hope and pray and then you get into more hope and pray and then you get into more heartache< heartache sleepless nights for no reason heartache sleepless nights for no reason that< that is why again as you can see many that is why again as you can see many times< times I've emphasized in this video times I've emphasized in this video choosing< choosing the right stock for the wheel choosing the right stock for the wheel strategy< strategy is the biggest the primary strategy is the biggest the primary factor< factor to determine if you will be factor to determine if you will be profitable< profitable so here's an example of profitable so here's an example of Google< Google so Google as you know is one of Google so Google as you know is one of the< the stocks that I will and it has done the stocks that I will and it has done very< very well for me and as you can see back very well for me and as you can see back in< in 2022 the whole stock market pretty in 2022 the whole stock market pretty much< much went down Google was no exception much went down Google was no exception as< as well as you can see it went down now as well as you can see it went down now during< during this time a lot of people just during this time a lot of people just get< get fearful and they exit their get fearful and they exit their positions< positions thinking that oh it's going to positions thinking that oh it's going to be< be a market crash and this time it will be a market crash and this time it will be< be different there's always this little be different there's always this little voice< voice that appears in your head that voice that appears in your head that tells< tells you that oh no maybe this time is tells you that oh no maybe this time is different< different only when the stock recovers different only when the stock recovers then< then you realize oh it's the the same as then you realize oh it's the the same as the< the past few crashes so the market went the past few crashes so the market went down< down in 2022 a lot of people panic they down in 2022 a lot of people panic they quickly< quickly sell off the stock for a loss quickly sell off the stock for a loss only< only to regret it later on because the only to regret it later on because the market< market eventually uh recovered and market eventually uh recovered and during< during this time I've actually been during this time I've actually been reing< reing the stock as it came down I have a reing the stock as it came down I have a video< video on it doing the Wheeling on Google video on it doing the Wheeling on Google and< and also on Amazon and same thing as and also on Amazon and same thing as well< well for meta right meta was another of well for meta right meta was another of the< the company where I did the wheel the company where I did the wheel strategy< strategy as well I did some lips on it strategy as well I did some lips on it as< as well so again 2022 Mana really went as well so again 2022 Mana really went down< down right as you can see this is pretty down right as you can see this is pretty much< much a crash from $400 there about it much a crash from $400 there about it dropped< dropped all the way to about I think dropped all the way to about I think about< about $100 or maybe under $1100 that's a about $100 or maybe under $1100 that's a very< very big move down now during this time very big move down now during this time a< a lot of people pnic as well they sell a lot of people pnic as well they sell away< away their stock but I didn't do that I away their stock but I didn't do that I continue< continue to do it because again I have continue to do it because again I have the< the firm belief especially in the the firm belief especially in the fundamentals< fundamentals right the company is fundamentals right the company is profitable< profitable is doing well chances of it profitable is doing well chances of it going< going to bankrupt is not as high as like going to bankrupt is not as high as like AMC< AMC GameStop and even Neo so as you can AMC GameStop and even Neo so as you can see< see in the end it recovered and that's see in the end it recovered and that's where< where again the wheel strategy going to where again the wheel strategy going to help< help you uh get the profits from the help you uh get the profits from the capital< capital gains by the way I just realized capital gains by the way I just realized that< that I put the number wrong it should be that I put the number wrong it should be number< number five so uh just ignore this so number five so uh just ignore this so let< let us go to the recap so mistake number let us go to the recap so mistake number one< one choosing High volatility stocks and one choosing High volatility stocks and not< not profitable companies so if you want not profitable companies so if you want to< to at least have a smoother Journey when to at least have a smoother Journey when you're< you're training the wheel strategy and you're training the wheel strategy and not< not have stressful and sleepless nights not have stressful and sleepless nights then< then choose companies that are at least then choose companies that are at least profitable< profitable right don't go for the ones profitable right don't go for the ones that< that high volatility only mistake number that high volatility only mistake number two< two choosing overvalued stocks so air on two choosing overvalued stocks so air on the< the safe side just go for the stocks the safe side just go for the stocks that< that are currently undervalued then you that are currently undervalued then you can< can start planning out your wheel can start planning out your wheel strategy< strategy and if you want to find out strategy and if you want to find out what< what the valuation of stocks is just what the valuation of stocks is just simply< simply go to any of the sites which I simply go to any of the sites which I mentioned< mentioned earlier mistake number three mentioned earlier mistake number three avoiding< avoiding assignment remember again avoiding assignment remember again capital< capital gains is one of the uh big part capital gains is one of the uh big part the< the potential profits of the wheel the potential profits of the wheel strategy< strategy so the whole idea is to get strategy so the whole idea is to get assigned< assigned so definitely you do not want assigned so definitely you do not want to< to avoid assignment once it's below your to avoid assignment once it's below your cash< cash secur put let it get assigned and cash secur put let it get assigned and then< then write the stock on the way up then write the stock on the way up before< before you sell the cover call mistake before you sell the cover call mistake number< number four ignoring potential capital number four ignoring potential capital gains< gains like I mentioned earlier just now gains like I mentioned earlier just now and< and finally mistake number five and that and finally mistake number five and that is< is to sell cover call below your entry is to sell cover call below your entry price< price so if you do this you run the risk price so if you do this you run the risk of< of the market suddenly shooting up past of the market suddenly shooting up past your< your cover call and now you're stuck your cover call and now you're stuck with< with a cover call that is well below with a cover call that is well below your< your entry price and when it gets called your entry price and when it gets called away< away you're going to be called away for away you're going to be called away for a< a loss so do yourself a favor avoid this a loss so do yourself a favor avoid this five< five mistakes and you will see that your five mistakes and you will see that your wheel< wheel strategy will start to do better wheel strategy will start to do better and< and you have much much better sleep at and you have much much better sleep at night< night by the way if you like this video night by the way if you like this video then< then you

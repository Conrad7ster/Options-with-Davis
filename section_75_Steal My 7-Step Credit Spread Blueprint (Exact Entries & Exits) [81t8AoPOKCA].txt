=================================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video I all right alrighty so in today's video I am< am going to be sharing with you a simple am going to be sharing with you a simple seven< seven step credit spread trading plan seven step credit spread trading plan from< from entry to exit so if you are new to from entry to exit so if you are new to trading< trading options especially if you're new trading options especially if you're new to< to training credit spread then you can to training credit spread then you can use< use this seven step trading plan that I use this seven step trading plan that I have< have for you now this is not the end all have for you now this is not the end all and< and be all but it's definitely a very and be all but it's definitely a very great< great way for you to get started in great way for you to get started in trading< trading credit spreads so step number trading credit spreads so step number one< one is to build your watch list of index one is to build your watch list of index ETFs< ETFs and individual stocks right if you ETFs and individual stocks right if you like< like only index ETFs you can just build like only index ETFs you can just build you< you know a watch list out of index ETFs you know a watch list out of index ETFs or< or if you only prefer individual stocks or if you only prefer individual stocks then< then you can do that as well but if then you can do that as well but if you've< you've been watching my channel for some you've been watching my channel for some time< time now then you know that my time now then you know that my preference< preference is more towards index ETS preference is more towards index ETS mainly< mainly because index ETFs are not as mainly because index ETFs are not as volatile< volatile as individual stocks so here is volatile as individual stocks so here is some< some statistics and data by the some statistics and data by the tastytrade< tastytrade team as well as you can see tastytrade team as well as you can see they've< they've already done a study on the they've already done a study on the movements< movements of ETFs compared to stocks movements of ETFs compared to stocks right< right so as as you can see below this is right so as as you can see below this is the< the standard deviation moves so the standard deviation moves so basically< basically you can see that the ETFs tend basically you can see that the ETFs tend to< to stay in a narrower range compared to to stay in a narrower range compared to the< the stocks right so this is ETFs the stocks right so this is ETFs whereas< whereas for the stocks they actually whereas for the stocks they actually have< have a much wider range now when we are have a much wider range now when we are trading< trading the credit spreads ideally we do trading the credit spreads ideally we do not< not want the market to move that much not want the market to move that much right< right especially if it stays somewhere right especially if it stays somewhere in< in the middle we want it to stay in the in the middle we want it to stay in the expected< expected move or move in the opposite expected move or move in the opposite direction< direction right so if you got your direction right so if you got your direction< direction right then of course if the direction right then of course if the market< market moves in the opposite direction market moves in the opposite direction of< of your spread then you're going to of your spread then you're going to start< start to make a lot pretty quickly that start to make a lot pretty quickly that can< can happen in stocks right but if you're can happen in stocks right but if you're wrong< wrong then you can really just blow wrong then you can really just blow through< through your spread as well so that is through your spread as well so that is why< why I prefer index ETFs it's much more why I prefer index ETFs it's much more controlled< controlled even though if the market controlled even though if the market moves< moves against you it does not move as moves against you it does not move as much< much as compared to individual stocks much as compared to individual stocks now< now step number two is to go through the now step number two is to go through the chart< chart of each of the underlying on your chart of each of the underlying on your watch< watch list to identify oversold or watch list to identify oversold or overbought< overbought conditions now you can overbought conditions now you can identify< identify this oversold or overbought identify this oversold or overbought conditions< conditions by using indicators so it conditions by using indicators so it will< will either be the stochastic oscillator will either be the stochastic oscillator or< or the RSI so if you're interested in or the RSI so if you're interested in putting< putting on this stochastic oscillator I putting on this stochastic oscillator I actually< actually already have a video which I actually already have a video which I created< created to share with you you know what created to share with you you know what are< are the settings that I put on when I are the settings that I put on when I put< put on the stochastic oscillator right put on the stochastic oscillator right so< so you can go and watch the video I'll so you can go and watch the video I'll put< put the link at the top right hand put the link at the top right hand corner< corner of this video so basically what corner of this video so basically what we're< we're trying to look out for is this we're trying to look out for is this oversold< oversold or overbought so as you can see oversold or overbought so as you can see down< down here this is oversold which also down here this is oversold which also suggests< suggests that the market right has a suggests that the market right has a lesser< lesser downside than it has to the lesser downside than it has to the upside< upside now that is not to say that the upside now that is not to say that the market< market once it's oversold it won't market once it's oversold it won't continue< continue to be oversold now of course continue to be oversold now of course there's< there's always a chance right but this there's always a chance right but this is< is just a probability game right if you is just a probability game right if you see< see that the indicator is oversold it see that the indicator is oversold it just< just means you know chances are that the just means you know chances are that the move< move to the downside there's lesser move to the downside there's lesser chance< chance for it to continue moving down chance for it to continue moving down compared< compared to moving up so same thing as compared to moving up so same thing as well< well down here you can see that once well down here you can see that once it's< it's oversold we're looking for this and it's oversold we're looking for this and on< on the other side we are looking for on the other side we are looking for overbought< overbought right so basically when it's overbought right so basically when it's oversold< oversold we're looking to put on put oversold we're looking to put on put spreads< spreads and then when it's overbought spreads and then when it's overbought we're< we're looking to put on our call Credit we're looking to put on our call Credit spread< spread now step number three if it is spread now step number three if it is oversold< oversold you want to identify support oversold you want to identify support levels< levels and if it's overbought you want levels and if it's overbought you want to< to identify. resistance levels so ideally to identify resistance levels so ideally we< we want to place our credit spread we want to place our credit spread beyond< beyond the support and resistance levels beyond the support and resistance levels and< and this is very important if you're and this is very important if you're just< just starting out because this will give just starting out because this will give you< you a much higher chance of success you a much higher chance of success because< because as you already know support and because as you already know support and resistance< resistance levels are places where the resistance levels are places where the market< market can turn right so especially if market can turn right so especially if you< you couple that with you know when the you couple that with you know when the indicator< indicator is either overboard or indicator is either overboard or oversold< oversold you have a pretty good chance oversold you have a pretty good chance of< of the market or the trade actually of the market or the trade actually working< working out in your direction so for working out in your direction so for example< example as you can see down here there example as you can see down here there is< is a support somewhere around here is a support somewhere around here because< because prices have previously bounced because prices have previously bounced here< here and then gone back up right so we here and then gone back up right so we know< know that this could be a very possible know that this could be a very possible support< support error as well as down here as support error as well as down here as well< well you see the price bounce down here well you see the price bounce down here and< and then the market went up so this and then the market went up so this Alliance< Alliance that we can draw so what we're Alliance that we can draw so what we're really< really looking for is to place our really looking for is to place our credit< credit spread below our support area if credit spread below our support area if it's< it's over soaked alright so this is the it's over soaked alright so this is the put< put spread minus one plus one and on the put spread minus one plus one and on the other< other side if it's overbought so for other side if it's overbought so for overbought< overbought you want to draw a resistance overbought you want to draw a resistance level< level so as you can see the prices have level so as you can see the prices have touched< touched somewhere around here and then touched somewhere around here and then now< now it's at the same Point again so at now it's at the same Point again so at this< this point of time you can see also the this point of time you can see also the stochastics< stochastics is showing that it's stochastics is showing that it's overbought< overbought so this is where we want to overbought so this is where we want to look< look into selling our call Credit spread look into selling our call Credit spread so< so ideally we want our call Credit so ideally we want our call Credit spread< spread to be above where the resistance spread to be above where the resistance is< is because hopefully right if this is because hopefully right if this resistance< resistance actually holds then the resistance actually holds then the market< market can actually come back down and market can actually come back down and that's< that's where you're going to be able to that's where you're going to be able to bake< bake your profits on your credit spread bake your profits on your credit spread so< so step number four is to identify your so step number four is to identify your DTE< DTE which is these two expiration DTE which is these two expiration basically< basically how many days left for your basically how many days left for your options< options to expire and also the short leg options to expire and also the short leg strike< strike price so basically the lower the strike price so basically the lower the Delta< Delta the more conservative the higher Delta the more conservative the higher the< the Delta the more aggressive and I'll the Delta the more aggressive and I'll get< get into this in the next slide but for get into this in the next slide but for now< now let's talk about the DTE so whenever now let's talk about the DTE so whenever I< I share any strategy with anyone people I share any strategy with anyone people have< have always ask me Davis can I use the have always ask me Davis can I use the strategy< strategy you know on the 7dte the weekly strategy you know on the 7dte the weekly DTE< DTE you know the 14 DTE or even the zero DTE you know the 14 DTE or even the zero DTE< DTE and the answer I give them is of DTE and the answer I give them is of course< course yes you know there's no stopping course yes you know there's no stopping you< you for putting whatever you want to put you for putting whatever you want to put on< on right you can put zero DTE two dtes on right you can put zero DTE two dtes all< all up to you but whether we have an all up to you but whether we have an edge< edge using the time frame the DTE is edge using the time frame the DTE is another< another question so for this we want to another question so for this we want to lean< lean on research and this is a research lean on research and this is a research page< page that I've shared you know quite a page that I've shared you know quite a number< number of times basically This research number of times basically This research piece< piece is measuring the expected move piece is measuring the expected move compared< compared to the realized move so as we compared to the realized move so as we know< know when we are trading short options know when we are trading short options our< our Edge lies in the fact that the our Edge lies in the fact that the expected< expected move is greater than the expected move is greater than the realized< realized move right so that is why we realized move right so that is why we win< win more often than we actually should win more often than we actually should be< be as depicted by the theoretical win be as depicted by the theoretical win rate< rate right so in this case you'll notice rate right so in this case you'll notice that< that if you were to go with the seven that if you were to go with the seven days< days option right the seven DTE you days option right the seven DTE you notice< notice that the expected move is notice that the expected move is actually< actually not bigger than the realized actually not bigger than the realized move< move for the 14 days it's not bigger as move for the 14 days it's not bigger as well< well 21 days it's not bigger 30 days is well 21 days it's not bigger 30 days is not< not bigger than a realized move as well not bigger than a realized move as well only< only when it's from 45 days it's bigger only when it's from 45 days it's bigger right< right 45 days it's bigger than the right 45 days it's bigger than the realized< realized move 60 days expected bigger realized move 60 days expected bigger than< than realize yes and 90 days expected than realize yes and 90 days expected bigger< bigger than realized so basically bigger than realized so basically anything< anything under 45 days these are the anything under 45 days these are the times< times whereby we do not necessarily have times whereby we do not necessarily have a< a statistical Edge right and this is a a statistical Edge right and this is a pretty< pretty significant data set as you can pretty significant data set as you can see< see this is done since 1993. so there's see this is done since 1993.

so there's quite< quite a little bit of a data that has quite a little bit of a data that has gone< gone into this uh testing this gone into this uh testing this experiment< experiment so whenever we're trading you experiment so whenever we're trading you know< know this kind of strategies that credit know this kind of strategies that credit spreads< spreads or iron Condor put racial spreads or iron Condor put racial spreads< spreads basically we want the market to spreads basically we want the market to stay< stay in the expected range as long as stay in the expected range as long as possible< possible right as often as possible that possible right as often as possible that is< is why we always want to look to the is why we always want to look to the data< data whereby you know the expected move data whereby you know the expected move is< is bigger than the realized move but if is bigger than the realized move but if the< the expected move is not bigger than the the expected move is not bigger than the realized< realized move it means now we don't realized move it means now we don't really< really have an edge down there so should really have an edge down there so should you< you go for the seven days or even the you go for the seven days or even the zero< zero DTE you know credit spread well zero DTE you know credit spread well we've< we've already seen the data down here so we've already seen the data down here so it's< it's really up to you to decide right if it's really up to you to decide right if you< you are getting good results for it go you are getting good results for it go ahead< ahead but for me personally I prefer the ahead but for me personally I prefer the 45< 45 to around the 65 days DTE for me 45 to around the 65 days DTE for me that's< that's the ideal one anything longer that's the ideal one anything longer than< than that you know there won't be really than that you know there won't be really that< that much you know kind of a Theta Decay that much you know kind of a Theta Decay because< because it's going to be very slow right because it's going to be very slow right so< so roughly anywhere from 45 to 65 is so roughly anywhere from 45 to 65 is kind< kind of this sweet spot for me okay next kind of this sweet spot for me okay next we< we want to identify where your short leg we want to identify where your short leg strike< strike price is going to be right strike price is going to be right because< because now we already identified the because now we already identified the DTE< DTE we re-identified all right is it DTE we re-identified all right is it going< going to be a put spread or cost spread going to be a put spread or cost spread so< so now we know that okay we have seen so now we know that okay we have seen that< that the stochastics is oversold and that the stochastics is oversold and then< then now we have identified where our then now we have identified where our support< support area are right so for this we support area are right so for this we want< want to place our short strike right we want to place our short strike right we first< first focus on the short strike we want first focus on the short strike we want to< to place our short strike below where to place our short strike below where the< the support area is so there are the support area is so there are different< different places where you can put right different places where you can put right if< if you want to be a little bit bit more if you want to be a little bit bit more aggressive< aggressive you go for the higher Delta aggressive you go for the higher Delta then< then you can put it closer to where the then you can put it closer to where the current< current market price is for your. short current market price is for your short strike< strike so this is where your current strike so this is where your current Delta< Delta is basically will be slightly Delta is basically will be slightly higher< higher so when it's higher basically you higher so when it's higher basically you get< get slightly more premium and slightly get slightly more premium and slightly more< more favorable risk to reward ratio more favorable risk to reward ratio compared< compared to if you were to go for the compared to if you were to go for the lower< lower Delta so the lower Delta is lower Delta so the lower Delta is basically< basically you know your short strike is basically you know your short strike is slightly< slightly further away from where the slightly further away from where the current< current market is compared to the higher current market is compared to the higher Delta< Delta so again there's no one that is Delta so again there's no one that is better< better than the other it really comes better than the other it really comes down< down to your outlook and they are just down to your outlook and they are just trade-offs< trade-offs right so if you are slightly trade-offs right so if you are slightly more< more bullish you can go with this right more bullish you can go with this right because< because you get more premium up front because you get more premium up front but< but if you're more conservative then you but if you're more conservative then you want< want to go for this one right you put it want to go for this one right you put it slightly< slightly further away from where the slightly further away from where the current< current market price is and then you current market price is and then you know< know there's a lesser chance for the know there's a lesser chance for the market< market to actually Bridge your this market to actually Bridge your this short< short strike compared to this one with short strike compared to this one with the< the higher Delta now what about for the the higher Delta now what about for the call< call spread so for the call Credit call spread so for the call Credit spread< spread same thing as well right it's spread same thing as well right it's just< just the opposite so if you want to go just the opposite so if you want to go for< for slightly more aggressive take that for slightly more aggressive take that means< means you are very confident right that means you are very confident right that the< the market is going to drop after you the market is going to drop after you know< know it hits the resistance point then know it hits the resistance point then you< you can go for the higher Delta shot you can go for the higher Delta shot strike< strike for the call spread right you strike for the call spread right you could< could choose one that is slightly closer could choose one that is slightly closer to< to the market if you are slightly more to the market if you are slightly more conservative< conservative you can go for the one that conservative you can go for the one that is< is slightly higher okay next step by the is slightly higher okay next step by the way< way if you

com blueprint all< all right back to the video now that we all right back to the video now that we have< have already identified where our short have already identified where our short strike< strike is going to be next is where we strike is going to be next is where we want< want to Define our spread with right so want to Define our spread with right so this< this is where we want to take into this is where we want to take into account< account our maximum risk that we have account our maximum risk that we have allocated< allocated for the trade so this is very allocated for the trade so this is very important< important so you want to practice very important so you want to practice very good< good Capital allocation so that you good Capital allocation so that you really< really do not mess up right especially really do not mess up right especially when< when the market goes against you because when the market goes against you because there< there are times the market will go there are times the market will go against< against you you will lose money okay so against you you will lose money okay so you< you just have to be prepared for that you just have to be prepared for that this< this is just part and parcel of trading this is just part and parcel of trading so< so for this you want to identify what so for this you want to identify what your< your max risk is and then you start your max risk is and then you start building< building your spread from there so let's building your spread from there so let's say< say for example your Mac. series is 500 say for example your Mac series is 500 which< which means to say you cannot lose more which means to say you cannot lose more than< than 500 for any particular trade okay than 500 for any particular trade okay so< so in this case what you want to do so in this case what you want to do first< first is you want to start off with a first is you want to start off with a five< five dollar width right because that is five dollar width right because that is basically< basically the max loss of your credit basically the max loss of your credit spread< spread right your max loss for your spread right your max loss for your credit< credit spread is basically your width credit spread is basically your width minus< minus the premium so in this case if we minus the premium so in this case if we start< start off with a five dollar width right start off with a five dollar width right just< just to get you started to design and just to get you started to design and construct< construct your credit spread because you construct your credit spread because you have< have a 500 risk you put five dollars have a 500 risk you put five dollars with< with and then you see what kind of with and then you see what kind of Premium< Premium you get right so in this case Premium you get right so in this case you< you notice that your premium is a dollar you notice that your premium is a dollar 25< 25 cents so you know that your max risk 25 cents so you know that your max risk on< on this trade is actually 3. 75 cents on this trade is actually 3.

75 cents which< which is 375 dollars per contract which which is 375 dollars per contract which also< also means to say Hey you actually still also means to say Hey you actually still have< have you know some room to add more risk have you know some room to add more risk to< to this trade right if you want to to this trade right if you want to fulfill< fulfill this Capital allocation so in fulfill this Capital allocation so in this< this case some people were actually just this case some people were actually just double< double up their spread they were double up their spread they were actually< actually just times two and then now actually just times two and then now they< they will have a risk of roughly what they will have a risk of roughly what 750< 750 is that correct yeah 750 so it's 750 is that correct yeah 750 so it's slightly< slightly above to 500 and I don't really slightly above to 500 and I don't really like< like this approach and the reason is like this approach and the reason is because< because it's going to be much more because it's going to be much more riskier< riskier compared to if you were to widen riskier compared to if you were to widen your< your width right so the next approach your width right so the next approach will< will be to widen your width and actually will be to widen your width and actually I< I already explained this in a previous I already explained this in a previous video< video where you know uh what are the top video where you know uh what are the top three< three deadliest mistakes for Credit three deadliest mistakes for Credit Express< Express so this is actually one of them Express so this is actually one of them you< you know where people actually choose to you know where people actually choose to double< double up their spread you know if they double up their spread you know if they see< see that you know their risk is let's see that you know their risk is let's say< say a thousand dollars then if they see say a thousand dollars then if they see that< that per trade they actually reach only that per trade they actually reach only 375< 375 they're gonna you know just have a 375 they're gonna you know just have a multiple< multiple of this maybe it's times three multiple of this maybe it's times three contracts< contracts of this but the better contracts of this but the better approach< approach would actually to be to widen approach would actually to be to widen your< your width why because. your risk your width why because your risk portrait< portrait actually does not change right portrait actually does not change right your< your risk per trade is going to be the your risk per trade is going to be the same< same the difference is that for the one same the difference is that for the one which< which you have multiple credit spreads which you have multiple credit spreads you'll< you'll find out that you're actually you'll find out that you're actually going< going to hit your loss much faster going to hit your loss much faster because< because you're this long put strike down because you're this long put strike down here< here it's much closer to where the here it's much closer to where the market< market price is compared to where it is market price is compared to where it is if< if you were to widen the width so that if you were to widen the width so that is< is why the approach would be safer or is why the approach would be safer or rather< rather it's less riskier if you were to rather it's less riskier if you were to widen< widen the width so by going with a five widen the width so by going with a five dollar< dollar wide width you notice that your dollar wide width you notice that your original< original only 375 so what you can do is original only 375 so what you can do is you< you can just widen it a little bit now you can just widen it a little bit now so< so you go with the six dollar width so you go with the six dollar width right< right now and then now you see what's right now and then now you see what's the< the premium that you can get so you the premium that you can get so you calculate< calculate your max series is 450 dollars calculate your max series is 450 dollars per< per contract so now this is very close per contract so now this is very close to< to 500 and you can definitely go with to 500 and you can definitely go with this< this spread right now now what if your this spread right now now what if your max< max risk is a thousand dollars so in max risk is a thousand dollars so in this< this case you can start off with a 10 this case you can start off with a 10 wide< wide spread and then you work your way wide spread and then you work your way from< from there right so 10 wide spread and from there right so 10 wide spread and then< then you see your premium is 2. 50 cents then you see your premium is 2.

50 cents so< so that means your max risk will be 750 so that means your max risk will be 750 dollars< dollars so in this case what you want to dollars so in this case what you want to do< do is widen it again and to see you know do is widen it again and to see you know what's< what's your max rate so if you widen what's your max rate so if you widen this< this now to 12 width you'll find that this now to 12 width you'll find that your< your max risk will now be 880 which your max risk will now be 880 which means< means to say there is still some room means to say there is still some room for< for you to widen your width so you try for you to widen your width so you try and< and widen again now you go for the 13 and widen again now you go for the 13 wide< wide width and now you see that it's 950 wide width and now you see that it's 950 per< per contract which means to say now it's per contract which means to say now it's pretty< pretty close to where your max risk per pretty close to where your max risk per trade< trade is and that means you can go for trade is and that means you can go for one< one credit spread one put spread instead one credit spread one put spread instead of< of going for five dollar wide and then of going for five dollar wide and then you< you times you know multiples of that you times you know multiples of that right< right so this is for the put spread for right so this is for the put spread for the< the credit spread is just the opposite the credit spread is just the opposite so<. so I won't go into that step number six so I won't go into that step number six so< so now that you already gotten your so now that you already gotten your credit< credit spread with you know where your credit spread with you know where your strikes< strikes are it's time for you to strikes are it's time for you to actually< actually enter the trade right so you actually enter the trade right so you want< want to place this using a limit order want to place this using a limit order and< and it's not filled you can either wait and it's not filled you can either wait or< or adjust till you get filled so how do or adjust till you get filled so how do you< you know whether you have a good chance you know whether you have a good chance of< of getting fuel so the way I like to put of getting fuel so the way I like to put it< it is basically I like to take a look at it is basically I like to take a look at this< this expected price first right so this this expected price first right so this expected< expected price is shown on your platform expected price is shown on your platform on< on the TD Ameritrade tastytrade have as on the TD Ameritrade tastytrade have as well< well so you want to take a look at the well so you want to take a look at the platform< platform that you're using to see platform that you're using to see whether< whether they actually give you an whether they actually give you an indication< indication of where you're likely to get indication of where you're likely to get fuel< fuel right so for this you can see that fuel right so for this you can see that the< the mid is 1. 97 which means to say that the mid is 1.

97 which means to say that this< this is the mid price it's not the this is the mid price it's not the guaranteed< guaranteed fuel price the guaranteed guaranteed fuel price the guaranteed fuel< fuel price is down here so when we are fuel price is down here so when we are selling< selling credit spreads we want to get as selling credit spreads we want to get as much< much credit as possible so usually I much credit as possible so usually I like< like to start slightly higher than where like to start slightly higher than where the< the mid price is you know try to test a the mid price is you know try to test a little< little. bit of my luck to see whether I little bit of my luck to see whether I can< can get filled at a higher price because can get filled at a higher price because sometimes< sometimes you do actually get filled sometimes you do actually get filled when< when it's a little bit higher or the when it's a little bit higher or the market< market could just come to you so market could just come to you so generally< generally that is why you know I place generally that is why you know I place it< it around the mid price now so in this it around the mid price now so in this case< case let's say we start off at 1. 99 so case let's say we start off at 1.

99 so this< this is just two cents above the mid this is just two cents above the mid price< price so what I'll do is I'll put in the price so what I'll do is I'll put in the order< order ticket I'll confirm and hit send order ticket I'll confirm and hit send and< and if it's not filled there are two and if it's not filled there are two things< things you can do right if it's not free things you can do right if it's not free you< you could either wait until you get you could either wait until you get filled< filled or if you do. want to get filled filled or if you do want to get filled right< right if you're afraid that the market right if you're afraid that the market is< is going to run away then this is where is going to run away then this is where you< you want to do what is called price you want to do what is called price Discovery< Discovery right price Discovery is Discovery right price Discovery is basically< basically just to lower your credit basically just to lower your credit price< price until you get filled so maybe the price until you get filled so maybe the next< next one you can change to 1. 98 you know next one you can change to 1.

98 you know and< and see whether you get fuel if 198 and see whether you get fuel. if 198 cents< cents you're not filled we change to cents you're not filled we change to 1. 97< 1.

97 if it's still not filled you move 1. 97 if it's still not filled you move down< down 1.

#### Topic 1

96 if it's still not filled you down 1. 96 if it's still not filled you go< go down lower so basically you get the go down lower so basically you get the point< point right you just inch down bit by point right you just inch down bit by bit< bit now what if you're on an underlying bit now what if you're. on an underlying where< where this spread is actually pretty big where this spread is actually pretty big right< right this gap down here is pretty big right this gap down here is pretty big maybe< maybe on the left hand side you will see maybe on the left hand side you will see 1.

5< 1. 5 as the natural this is where you're 1.

5 as the natural this is where you're guaranteed< guaranteed to get filled and maybe on guaranteed to get filled and maybe on the< the right hand side is two dollars so if the right hand side is two dollars so if you< you see this you notice that the spread you see this you notice that the spread is< is pretty wide so in this case you may is pretty wide so in this case you may. not< not necessarily want to inch down by one not necessarily want to inch down by one cent< cent because if you're going to do that cent because if you're going to do that you< you may have to do a really long time you may have to do a really long time from< from two dollars you want to inch it all from two dollars you want to inch it all the< the way down to 150. so in this case the way down to 150.

so in this case maybe< maybe you can do 2 cents three cents or maybe you can do 2 cents three cents or even< even 5 cents interval right every five even 5 cents interval right every five cents< cents maybe start with two dollar it cents maybe start with two dollar it doesn't< doesn't get filled drop to 195 then you doesn't get filled drop to 195 then you go< go to 190 so on and so forth all right go to 190 so on and so forth all right so< so this is how I will actually enter so this is how I will actually enter into< into my trades now next you want to plan into my trades now next you want to plan your< your exit scenarios right so once you your exit scenarios right so once you already< already got the trade in you want to already got the trade in you want to plan< plan how you're going to exit so there plan how you're going to exit so there are< are generally two ways you can do that are generally two ways you can do that right< right and an additional Third Way so the right and an additional Third Way so the first< first way is basically a fixed take first way is basically a fixed take profit< profit right a fixed tax profit profit right a fixed tax profit generally< generally is like maybe 50 of the max generally is like maybe 50 of the max premium< premium that you can get so let's say premium that you can get so let's say for< for example if the max premium is two for example if the max premium is two dollars< dollars you may have a tick profit at dollars you may have a tick profit at around< around one dollar so as you can see down around one dollar so as you can see down here< here this is a study done by the tasty here this is a study done by the tasty trade< trade team again basically they compared trade team again basically they compared if< if you were to hold your credit spread if you were to hold your credit spread to< to expiration versus you know you were to expiration versus you know you were to< to take off at a fixed percentage so in to take off at a fixed percentage so in this< this case I believe they did it at 50 this case I believe they did it at 50 you< you can see that the win rate is much you can see that the win rate is much higher< higher if you had a tick profit at 50 higher if you had a tick profit at 50 right< right you can see that your return is right you can see that your return is also< also much higher you can see your daily also much higher you can see your daily pay< pay channel is higher than if you were pay channel is higher than if you were to< to hold to expiration now the other way to hold to expiration now the other way is< is to exit your trade early which in is to exit your trade early which in this< this sense is basically to exit at 21 this sense is basically to exit at 21 DTE< DTE so as you can see if you were to DTE so as you can see if you were to exit< exit at 21 DTE your average loss is much exit at 21 DTE your average loss is much lesser< lesser although you know you have a lesser although you know you have a slightly< slightly lower win rate but your return slightly lower win rate but your return is< is actually still higher than if you is actually still higher than if you were< were to hold all the way to expiration were to hold all the way to expiration so< so when you're trading credit spreads so when you're trading credit spreads ideally< ideally you do not want to hold to ideally you do not want to hold to expiration< expiration because if you hold to expiration because if you hold to expiration< expiration you also have the risk of expiration you also have the risk of early< early assignment right so it would be early assignment right so it would be better< better if you either chose to exit you better if you either chose to exit you know< know at a fixed take profit point or to know at a fixed take profit point or to exit< exit early at 21 DTE now you might be exit early at 21 DTE now you might be asking< asking which is better right which one asking which is better right which one should< should you choose so there really isn't should you choose so there really isn't one< one that is better it's just that there one that is better it's just that there are< are pros and cons so you can see that if are pros and cons so you can see that if you< you were to take profit at 50 right you you were to take profit at 50 right you will< will have a high win rate but you have will have a high win rate but you have no< no loss control right your loss will be no loss control right your loss will be pretty< pretty similar to if you will hold to pretty similar to if you will hold to expiration< expiration and for 21 DTE you will have expiration and for 21 DTE you will have lower< lower voltage quality which means to say lower voltage quality which means to say that< that you actually have you know lesser that you actually have you know lesser average< average losses but your p l is more average losses but your p l is more random< random so as you can see down here as random so as you can see down here as well< well for the max drawdown you can see well for the max drawdown you can see for< for the holding to expiration you notice for the holding to expiration you notice that< that it's pretty same as if you're a 50 that it's pretty same as if you're a 50 winner< winner right so this is talking about winner right so this is talking about you< you know the kind of losses that you you know the kind of losses that you could< could see on your trades so if you're could see on your trades so if you're one< one that you know you don't like to see one that you know you don't like to see that< that much losses you like a very that much losses you like a very controlled< controlled volatility in your p l then controlled volatility in your p l then you< you want to go for exiting at 21 DTE now you want to go for exiting at 21 DTE now the< the alternative will be just to have a the alternative will be just to have a combination< combination of both right you can either combination of both right you can either go< go for 50 winner or 21 DTE whichever go for 50 winner or 21 DTE whichever comes< comes first right so that means if it comes first right so that means if it hits< hits your 50 take profit you're out of hits your 50 take profit you're out of the< the trade and if at 21 DTE it doesn't the trade and if at 21 DTE it doesn't hit< hit your 50 take profit you just get out hit your 50 take profit you just get out. of< of the trade so this way you kind of of the trade so this way you kind of have< have like The Best of Both Worlds so have like The Best of Both Worlds so again< again there is a study done where they again there is a study done where they you< you know show the results of all the you know show the results of all the three< three different management styles right three different management styles right exit< exit at 21 DTE take profit at 50 and the exit at 21 DTE take profit at 50 and the combination< combination of both now this is on the combination of both now this is on the 16< 16 Delta puts because I don't think 16 Delta puts because I don't think there< there is a study on the put spread or at there is a study on the put spread or at least< least I couldn't find one so for this is least I couldn't find one so for this is pretty< pretty similar right so you can see that pretty similar right so you can see that with< with the combo you can see that it's with the combo you can see that it's slightly< slightly below the earlier and the slightly below the earlier and the winner< winner right but at the same time you winner right but at the same time you notice< notice that it's also pretty control notice that it's also pretty control your< your p l right at times right you'll your p l right at times right you'll notice< notice that your penile is actually notice that your penile is actually above< above winners if you were to take profit above winners if you were to take profit at< at 50 and pretty much on par with uh at 50 and pretty much on par with uh managing< managing earlier so this really comes managing earlier so this really comes down< down to you so either one of this is down to you so either one of this is good< good as long as you do not hold to good as long as you do not hold to expiration expiration expiration now< now you might be asking what about stop now you might be asking what about stop losses< losses Davis if I Implement a stop loss losses Davis if I Implement a stop loss it< it will improve my performance if I were it will improve my performance if I were to< to add this you know with the take to add this you know with the take profit< profit and the exit at 21 DTE so one profit and the exit at 21 DTE so one thing< thing you have to understand about the thing you have to understand about the credit< credit spread is that the credit spread credit spread is that the credit spread already< already has an inbuilt stop loss in already has an inbuilt stop loss in place< place that is why you put on the credit place that is why you put on the credit spread< spread in the first place it is a spread spread in the first place it is a spread it< it is not a naked position right if you it is not a naked position right if you go< go on a naked position and you're go on a naked position and you're thinking< thinking of putting a stop loss I can thinking of putting a stop loss I can understand< understand the kind of uh thinking but understand the kind of uh thinking but when< when it comes to a credit spread there when it comes to a credit spread there really< really is no point because it's really is no point because it's redundant< redundant it's like having a stop loss redundant it's like having a stop loss on< on top of another stop loss right so if on top of another stop loss right so if you< you already have a credit spread then you already have a credit spread then this< this is where you already have your stop this is where you already have your stop loss< loss no need to put another stop loss loss no need to put another stop loss now< now just in case you're wondering what now just in case you're wondering what happens< happens if you actually put a stop loss happens if you actually put a stop loss then< then the tasting trade team actually has then the tasting trade team actually has already< already done a study on this because already done a study on this because apparently< apparently a lot of people have been apparently a lot of people have been asking< asking about this as well and you can asking about this as well and you can see< see that the results the performance is see that the results the performance is actually< actually worse than if you were to hold actually worse than if you were to hold it< it operation can you see that so in this it operation can you see that so in this case< case you actually might as well just case you actually might as well just hold< hold the exploration rather than to hold the exploration rather than to manage< manage your loss that means to have a manage your loss that means to have a fixed< fixed cutoff point so as you can see in fixed cutoff point so as you can see in this< this case it doesn't really work so well this case it doesn't really work so well when< when it comes to trading options when it comes to trading options especially< especially when it comes to trading especially when it comes to trading spreads< spreads because spreads already have an spreads because spreads already have an inbuilt< inbuilt stop loss in place so when it inbuilt stop loss in place so when it comes< comes to trading credit spreads I don't comes to trading credit spreads I don't want< want you to focus on having a stop loss want you to focus on having a stop loss because< because there's no point but rather because there's no point but rather focus< focus on your max risk per trade what focus on your max risk per trade what you're< you're comfortable with as the max loss you're comfortable with as the max loss for< for the particular spread then you want for the particular spread then you want to< to exit based on either getting out at to exit based on either getting out at 50< 50 of the profit or exiting at 21 DTE or 50 of the profit or exiting at 21 DTE or a< a combination of both so guys this is a combination of both so guys this is the< the seven step credit spread trading the seven step credit spread trading plan< plan by the way if you like this video plan by the way if you like this video

them so clearly it's not tools work for them so clearly it's not the< the tools but me right so I guess a few the tools but me right so I guess a few of< of the AR moments is understanding that of the AR moments is understanding that as< as as Traders right you you need to have as as Traders right you you need to have an< an an age in the markets you need to an an age in the markets you need to know< know why your trading strategy works know why your trading strategy works right< right if you don't not know why then right if you don't not know why then probably< probably you know you won't have the probably you know you won't have the conviction< conviction the confidence to trade it conviction the confidence to trade it for< for the long run so that's one of the for the long run so that's one of the biggest< biggest realization having an age in the biggest realization having an age in the markets< markets trading systems is is is markets trading systems is is is important< important right to make sure that you important right to make sure that you know< know when exactly to buy when exactly to know when exactly to buy when exactly to sell< sell how much to buy how much to sell sell how much to buy how much to sell you< you know and all I think stuff that I you know and all I think stuff that I think< think most Traders can relate to right think most Traders can relate to right so< so yeah so understanding and age proper so yeah so understanding and age proper risk< risk management and then uh in the risk management and then uh in the recent< recent years May the last four to five recent years May the last four to five years< years I started expanding the uh trading years I started expanding the uh trading systems< systems that I trade so previously I was systems that I trade so previously I was more< more of like a one trick pony I just more of like a one trick pony I just trade< trade this particular strategy that's it trade this particular strategy that's it right< right but I realize you know every right but I realize you know every strategy< strategy has their own pros and cons strategy has their own pros and cons right< right so for example if you trade the uh right so for example if you trade the uh breakout< breakout trading in the US Stock Market breakout trading in the US Stock Market it's< it's going to do well in Bull markets it's going to do well in Bull markets but< but what about choppy markets bare but what about choppy markets bare Market< Market it's not going to do well so this Market it's not going to do well so this way< way if you have other trading systems way if you have other trading systems that< that comes in right you will you know that comes in right you will you know definitely< definitely smooth out your Equity curve definitely smooth out your Equity curve over< over time lower your risk lower your over time lower your risk lower your draw< draw down and ultimately you know sleep draw down and

trading< trading systems yeah yeah so I think you trading systems yeah yeah so I think you mentioned< mentioned quite a number of very mentioned quite a number of very important< important points so maybe let's take a important points so maybe let's take a step< step back a little bit first maybe back step back a little bit first maybe back to< to the time when you first started to the time when you first started trading< trading you mentioned it was like a I trading you mentioned it was like a I think< think it was a Forex Trading competition think it was a Forex Trading competition maybe< maybe can you talk more a little bit maybe can you talk more a little bit about< about that and how did you actually do about that and how did you actually do in< in the Forex Trading competition I in the Forex Trading competition I remember< remember that one was a university uh remember that one was a university uh that< that was my first exposure to Forex a that was my first exposure to Forex a

some price you been some money some price AF< AF try how difficult I just give it a AF try how difficult I just give it a shot< shot right so I think I believe the shot right so I think I believe the first< first time I joined the competition I I first time I joined the competition I I got< got knocked out pretty fast because I got knocked out pretty fast because I just< just blew up the account but the second just blew up the account but the second time< time I joined I I I thought I did pretty time I joined I I I thought I did pretty old< old okay was I think the top 10 probably old okay was I think the top 10 probably oh< oh wow what exact ranking a very small oh wow what exact ranking a very small price< price like maybe some V $50 $100 I was price like maybe some V $50 $100 I was ex< ex was a very small price but I was one ex was a very small price but I was one of< of the the top top 10 Traders back then of the the top top 10 Traders back then but< but again uh was it due to skill this but again uh was it due to skill this more< more of luck I I didn't really know what more of luck I I didn't really know what was< was doing I know that I I was taking was doing I know that

had previously of job you actually had previously of course< course yeah of course so it must be course yeah of course so it must be quite< quite a difficult transition in a sense quite a difficult transition in a sense because< because you have to give up like the because you have to give up like the security< security of a fixed paycheck to go for security of a fixed paycheck to go for you< you know only four $0000 and you're not you know only four $0000 and you're not even< even sure whether you know it will even sure whether you know it will actually< actually be something that you will do actually be something that you will do for< for a long term or you will be for a long term or you will be successful< successful in it so maybe could you walk successful in it so maybe could you walk me< me through what is the mindset you have me through what is the mindset you have because< because it can be quite difficult for because it can be quite difficult for someone< someone to transition from you know a someone to transition from you know a full-time< full-time secure job to do something's a full-time secure job to do something's a little< little bit uncertain okay so maybe some little bit uncertain okay so maybe some context< context here at this point in time right context here at this point in time right when< when I was about to leave my full-time when I was about to leave my full-time paying< paying job for something more uncertain paying job for something more uncertain I< I was single right uh no kids still I was single right uh no kids still living< living with my parents they don't need living with my parents they don't need me< me to support them so for me it's like a me to support them so for me it's like a no-brainer< no-brainer at point it's like a call no-brainer at point it's like a call option< option going along a call option I just option going along a call option I just sacrifice< sacrifice this one if all else feels I sacrifice this one if all else feels I can< can always go back to a corporate job so can always go back to a corporate job so I< I just you know for go a fix paying job I just you know for go a fix paying job for< for something is uncertain but hey the for something is uncertain but hey the upside< upside is kind of like unlimited right upside is kind of like unlimited right so< so you never know how far trading can so you never know how far trading can take< take you and for me even if I don't make take you and for me even if I don't make it< it at least I can acquire a new skill it at least I can acquire a new skill trading< trading from the other professional trading from the other professional Traders< Traders so to me there wasn't much doubt Traders so to me there wasn't much doubt about< about to what to do so mainly because about to what to do so mainly because also< also at a younger stage so you're also at a younger stage so you're willing< willing to just try things out but let's willing to just try things out but let's say< say if you were at maybe the middle say if you were at maybe the middle stages< stages maybe now you're married some stages maybe now you're married some kids<

was they invited us to play< play poker with the other candidates I play poker with the other candidates I think< think that was the second interview the think that was the second interview the first< first interview I was speaking to the first interview I was speaking to the interview< interview then the second interview the interview then the second interview the full< full we were playing poker together well full we were playing poker together well that< that was memorable yeah I didn't do well that was memorable yeah I didn't do well for< for the poker so I wasn't selected the for the poker so I wasn't selected the other< other one which I thought was quite other one which I thought was quite memorable< memorable was back then prop training memorable was back then prop training using< using a lot of the the order flow the using a lot of the the order flow the depth< depth of the market right so they give depth of the market right so they give us< us four screen four letterers right and us four screen four letterers right and us< us to sport any patterns where we can us to sport any patterns where we can spot< spot any trading opportunity basically spot any trading opportunity basically it's< it's arbitraging uh uh opportunity it's arbitraging uh uh opportunity that's< that's available buy at this low price that's available buy at this low price on< on this particular exchange and sell it on this particular exchange and sell it the< the higher price of this exchange so the higher price of this exchange so that< that was another interesting aspect for that was another interesting aspect for the< the interview okay so uh maybe can you the interview okay so uh maybe can you share< share a little bit more about your share a little bit more about your experience< experience then so once you got into the experience then so once you got into the proprietary< proprietary trading firm how was your proprietary trading firm how was your experience< experience like your time there overall experience like your time there overall say< say it's a good experience you learn a say it's a good experience you learn a lot< lot about frugality so because we have lot about frugality so because we have like< like 400 a month the the shop the place like 400 a month the the shop the place that< that ravel's place food isn't exactly that ravel's place food isn't exactly cheap< cheap so you really have to make do with cheap so you really have to make do with what< what you have I remember my daily what you have I remember my daily expense< expense was like I think $15 a day lunch expense was like I think $15 a day lunch dinner< dinner plus transport and that's enough dinner plus transport and that's enough right< right at that point in time so that right at that point in time so that taught< taught me. a lot about frugality to taught me a lot about frugality to really< really to be able to sustain with just really to be able to sustain with just that< that little bit then another thing is that little bit then another thing is also< also it taught me a lot about what not also it taught me a lot about what not to< to do as a Trader because to do as a Trader because just< just because you know you're working in just because you know you're working in a< a prop trading film doesn't mean every a prop trading film doesn't mean every Trader< Trader is a profitable Trader doesn't Trader is a profitable Trader doesn't mean< mean every Trader is a good Trader so mean every Trader is a good Trader so they< they are Trader who make uh bad they are Trader who make uh bad decisions< decisions bad mistakes and that's again decisions bad mistakes and that's again a< a learning Avenue for you to tell a learning Avenue for you to tell yourself< yourself you know don't be like them yourself you know don't be like them right< right so make sure not to end up like right so make sure not to end up like them< them right so I think those were the two them right so I think those were the two biggest< biggest lessons that I had right biggest lessons that I had right strategy< strategy wise not so much I think they strategy wise not so much I think they kind< kind of like left us to our own devices kind of like left us to our own devices to< to kind of like formulate our own there to kind of like formulate our own there wasn't< wasn't like a formal training so to wasn't like a formal training so to speak< speak to teach their strategies for you speak to teach their strategies for you all< all to implement or it's more like all to implement or it's more like something< something you have to devise on your own something you have to devise on your own in< in terms of the training I don't think in terms of the training I don't think we< we had like specific strategy so back we had like specific strategy so back then< then they were doing a lot of uh Futures then they were doing a lot of uh Futures spreading< spreading I think most people are not spreading I think most people are not familiar< familiar with this so basically they familiar with this so basically they they'll< they'll do what we call the calender they'll do what we call the calender spread< spread right so being doing spreads spread right so being doing spreads right< right so basically maybe in 0607 you right so basically maybe in 0607 you could< could still make good money doing it could still make good money doing it doing< doing doing it but my time when entered doing doing it but my time when entered the< the algorithm the the robots already the algorithm the the robots already entered< entered the scene them way faster than entered the scene them way faster than us< us so those strategies were not doable us so those strategies were not doable but< but by a human Trader we not we not as but by a human Trader we not we not as far< far so that strategy sort of like didn't far so that strategy sort of like didn't work< work anymore so by spreading to see if I work anymore so by spreading to see if I get< get it right does it mean that you are get it right does it mean that you are buying< buying one security and then you're buying one security and then you're selling< selling another one that is pretty selling another one that is pretty closely< closely correlated sort of so for for closely correlated sort of so for for them< them they were trading a lot of Nik so them they were trading a lot of Nik so Nik< Nik is traded if I'm not wrong on three Nik is traded if I'm not wrong on three different< different exchanges four different different exchanges four different contracts< contracts so you can do like Arbitrage contracts so you can do like Arbitrage spread< spread like for example on the US spread like for example on the US exchange< exchange against the Osaka exchange not exchange against the Osaka exchange not always< always the price are the same so always the price are the same so sometimes< sometimes when the price is very slight sometimes when the price is very slight difference< difference if you're fast enough you can difference if you're fast enough you can actually< actually make a soal risk-free profit actually make a soal risk-free profit not< not say risk free LA you know you have not say risk free LA you know you have to< to still lick the spread and make sure to still lick the spread and make sure you< you can capture the difference there's you can capture the difference there's some some some opportunities< opportunities uh few times right but as opportunities uh few times right but as time< time passes right the robots at faster time passes right the robots at faster and< and faster such opportunities kind of and faster such opportunities kind of like< like disappeared so that was actually like disappeared so that was actually one< one of the strategies like we were one of the strategies like we were taught< taught initially to kind of capture this taught initially to kind of capture this arbitraging< arbitraging opportunities do you go arbitraging opportunities do you go through< through a period where you know when you through a period where you know when you first< first got in you say that you're on first got in you say that you're on probation< probation is this a time whereby you're probation is this a time whereby you're just< just trading like a trial account so to just trading like a trial account so to speak< speak or the company's account and you speak or the company's account and you have< have to kind of prove yourself first have to kind of prove yourself first before< before you actually could trade your own before you actually could trade your own account< account under the firm's name then they account under the firm's name then they give< give you profit share because it was give you profit share because it was like< like that was what I did for my price like that was what I did for my price trading< trading firm right they gave you a trading firm right they gave you a company's< company's account to just trade first company's account to just trade first and< and then they want to see whether you're and then they want to see whether you're consistent< consistent enough then after you know consistent enough then after you know maybe< maybe a while you proven yourself then maybe a while you proven yourself then they< they actually give you actual account they actually give you actual account was< was it like this for yours or your was it like this for yours or your should< should away had a account to trade very should away had a account to trade very similar< similar so they give us like a demo similar so they give us like a demo account< account at the start to make sure that account at the start to make sure that uh< uh we know what we're doing I think uh we know what we're doing I think basically< basically we know how to manage our risk basically we know how to manage our risk right< right and then finally if you can then right and then finally if you can then they< they kind of like give you the life they kind of like give you the life account< account to trade you have any memorable account to trade you have any memorable experience< experience in your prop trading firm experience in your prop trading firm that< that kind of shape how you are as a that kind of shape how you are as a Trader< Trader today one of the more memorable Trader today one of the more memorable time< time is that trading always there's time is that trading always there's opportunities< opportunities when the markets are quiet opportunities when the markets are quiet or< or maybe waiting for big news that NFP or maybe waiting for big news that NFP we< we playing we're playing Counter Strike we playing we're playing Counter Strike you< you know Counter Strike yeah five 41 you know Counter Strike yeah five 41 playing< playing so that was very memorable so so playing so that was very memorable so so before< before you know Market actions pick up before you know Market actions pick up we< we just playing Counter Strike to kill we just playing Counter Strike to kill time< time don't do anything stupid so I don't time don't do anything stupid so I don't know< know if you ask me what's the more know if you ask me what's the more memorable< memorable that comes to my mind so memorable that comes to my mind so that's< that's very interesting so for my PL that's very interesting so for my PL firm< firm uh we cannot play games but we can firm uh we cannot play games but we can watch< watch movies right so we always have one watch movies right so we always have one of< of the screens where we will put up some of the screens where we will put up some of< of those movies to watch so for your of those movies to watch so for your film< film you actually could play games and film you actually could play games and is< is this like a form of relaxation or is is this like a form of relaxation or is just< just it's just so bored that you might just it's just so bored that you might as< as well just play game I think both are as well just play game I think both are relaxation< relaxation plus a bit of bonding with relaxation plus a bit of bonding with the< the the the other Traders even the the the the other Traders even the bosses< bosses believe us so yeah so oh that's bosses believe us so yeah so oh that's very< very interesting okay so now after you very interesting okay so now after you finish< finish the propor so I understand that finish the propor so I understand that you< you know uh after being in the prop for you know uh after being in the prop for some< some time you decided to leave right so some time you decided to leave right so to< to trade your account yeah so was this a to trade your account yeah so was this a difficult< difficult decision again for you because difficult decision again for you because you< you know in a prop firm you trade the you know in a prop firm you trade the firm's< firm's money so let's say if you have a firm's money so let's say if you have a very< very big loss day at least your own very big loss day at least your own money< money don't get touched right because money don't get touched right because it's< it's the F's money but if you now start it's the F's money but if you now start to< to trade your own account any losses you to trade your own account any losses you really< really feel it right now so can you talk really feel it right now so can you talk me< me through about that right I think for me through about that right I think for me< me to leave was not a very difficult me to leave was not a very difficult decision< decision because I know that number one decision because I know that number one is< is that when I leave I don't have to pay is that when I leave I don't have to pay the< the desk fees anymore we paying like, to the desk fees anymore we paying like, to 2,000< 2,000 a month that range was exact 2,000 a month that range was exact figure< figure so I can save on that and also I figure so I can save on that and also I do< do not need the soal facilities of the do not need the soal facilities of the pro< pro because I want to focus more on pro because I want to focus more on higher< higher time frame like you know the 4our higher time frame like you know the 4our daily< daily so again to me it doesn't really daily so again to me it doesn't really make< make sense to pay such fees to be a make sense to pay such fees to be a shortterm< shortterm Trader which is not what I shortterm Trader which is not what I want< want to be so touching on the fact that want to be so touching on the fact that I< I now would have to risk uh my own real I now would have to risk uh my own real money< money at the point in time I was really money at the point in time I was really trading< trading my own life account so risking trading my own life account so risking real< real money on the line wasn't a foreign real money on the line wasn't a foreign concept< concept to me so yeah of course the the concept to me so yeah of course the the the< the amount that I'm trading on my firm's the amount that I'm trading on my firm's account< account and my own life trading account account and my own life trading account is< is different right but I guess being is different right but I guess being exposed< exposed to the life markets getting your exposed to the life markets getting your feet< feet wet with your own life money the feet wet with your own life money the fear< fear isn't as bad compared to someone fear isn't as bad compared to someone from< from Trading the firm's money to their from Trading the firm's money to their own< own money might be bigger I'm not sure own money might be bigger I'm not sure but< but I still trading fors money is still but I still trading fors money is still sort< sort of your money because it's still sort of your money because it's still real< real money on the line here yeah that's real money on the line here yeah that's true< true so do you have any challenges you true so do you have any challenges you face< face right any difficulty you face when face right any difficulty you face when you< you first transition into trading your you first transition into trading your own< own account yeah one of the biggest own account yeah one of the biggest challeng< challeng is the capital size is not very challeng is the capital size is not very large< large to start with and of course large to start with and of course trading< trading how much money you make is a trading how much money you make is a function< function of how much Capital that you function of how much Capital that you have< have right someone with 10,000 someone have right someone with 10,000 someone with< with a million their have returns could with a million their have returns could be< be 10% but the numbers be very different be 10% but the numbers be very different so< so the challenge at one of the challenge so the challenge at one of the challenge at< at the start was you know getting a at the start was you know getting a sufficient< sufficient sufficiently large size of a sufficient sufficiently large size of a trading< trading account okay so did you at least trading account okay so did you at least maybe< maybe try to do some part-time job orite maybe try to do some part-time job orite hust< hust at that point of time to maybe try hust at that point of time to maybe try and< and build up your capital I think the and build up your capital I think the only< only thing part was uh the business only thing part was uh the business trading< trading V at Point time it was really trading V at Point time it was really sort< sort of live right uh wasn't bring any sort of live right uh wasn't bring any Revenue< Revenue yet but that eventually helped Revenue yet but that eventually helped to< to scale up the trading account you know to scale up the trading account you know through< through the CES that we sell right that through the CES that we sell right that helped< helped to you know scale up my own size helped to you know scale up my own size of< of my trading account okay um was there of my trading account okay um was there any< any time during this time where you did any time during this time where you did home< home you suddenly felt that you know home you suddenly felt that you know it's< it's a little bit too difficult I want it's a little bit too difficult I want to< to go back to maybe the comfort of a to go back to maybe the comfort of a full-time< full-time job or will you always I know full-time job or will you always I know this< this is my goal I'm just going to push this is my goal I'm just going to push through< through no matter what happens I guess I through no matter what happens I guess I might< might reconsider back a fulltime time might reconsider back a fulltime time job< job if like after trading on my own job if like after trading on my own let's< let's say after like one two years the let's say after like one two years the savings< savings starts to deplete and then the savings starts to deplete and then the the< the the money I'm bring from Trading is the the money I'm bring from Trading is not< not enough to sustain you I might not enough to sustain you I might consider< consider but I was really I think I'm consider but I was really I think I'm blessed< blessed and fortunate right from the blessed and fortunate right from the from< from the start you know when I started from the start you know when I started trading< trading right uh uh things were okay trading right uh uh things were okay plus< plus uh having the uh trading frer I plus uh having the uh trading frer I think< think the first thing I did we did after think the first thing I did we did after one< one or two years was we launch a one or two years was we launch a mentorship< mentorship program then that help bring mentorship program then that help bring another< another source of Revenue and like hey another source of Revenue and like hey you< you know people actually paying me to you know people actually paying me to Mentor< Mentor them how to trade great right so Mentor them how to trade great right so even< even in my trading let's say this month even in my trading let's say this month this< this qu doing money I still have money this qu doing money I still have money from< from the mentorship things could work from the mentorship things could work out< out so at a point time I just went with out so at a point time I just went with the< the belief that you know we'll take it the belief that you know we'll take it one< one step at a time and you know fast one step at a time and you know fast forward< forward to today fortunately I'm still forward to today fortunately I'm still not< not not employed that's a good thing not not employed that's a good thing yeah< yeah that's good to hear so at least yeah that's good to hear so at least there's< there's you know some at least other there's you know some at least other sources< sources of income to come in otherwise sources of income to come in otherwise from< from you know at least my own experience from you know at least my own experience as< as well if you were to just trade you as well if you were to just trade you know< know the markets just fulltime to try know the markets just fulltime to try and< and replace the current income it can and replace the current income it can get< get very psychologically very tough get very psychologically very tough because< because as we know in trading averages because as we know in trading averages we< we can definitely be profit for the year we can definitely be profit for the year but< but that does not mean month to month but that does not mean month to month we'll< we'll always be profit so there'll be we'll always be profit so there'll be always< always times let say we go through a always times let say we go through a draw< draw down if you always rely on a draw down if you always rely on a current< current or rather trading as your source current or rather trading as your source of< of income main source that can be a of income main source that can be a little< little bit tough psychologically yeah so little bit tough psychologically yeah so maybe< maybe can you share with us a little bit maybe can you share with us a little bit more< more now regarding your trading style more now regarding your trading style right< right how you are trading right now so right how you are trading right now so maybe< maybe for those who are not really maybe for those who are not really familiar< familiar with you share with us you know familiar with you share with us you know a< a little bit more about your trading a little bit more about your trading style< style how you approach the markets okay style how you approach the markets okay has< has changed a lot over the years but has changed a lot over the years but right< right now see I'm like uh a good 80% as right now see I'm like uh a good 80% as a< a systematic Trader trading across uh a systematic Trader trading across uh stock< stock markets Forex Market commodity stock markets Forex Market commodity markets< markets and at this stage like you know markets and at this stage like you know talking< talking to you now I run uh multiple talking to you now I run uh multiple trading< trading systems that that seeks to take trading systems that that seeks to take advantage< advantage of certain Market phenomenon advantage of certain Market phenomenon for< for example ear we talked about the for example ear we talked about the stock< stock market so let's say uh one trading stock market so let's say uh one trading system< system that that identifies stocks in an system that that identifies stocks in an uptrend< uptrend we will buy on the pullback and uptrend we will buy on the pullback and then< then sell on the rally that could be then sell on the rally that could be system< system number one system number two system number one system number two could< could be also trading a stock market but could be also trading a stock market but instead< instead of buying pullback we buy instead of buying pullback we buy breakout< breakout then we Trail our stops to breakout then we Trail our stops to right< right the trended system number two then right the trended system number two then the< the third trading system that I have is the third trading system that I have is uh< uh trading more towards the Forex and uh trading more towards the Forex and commodities< commodities markets the trend following commodities markets the trend following system< system for the Futures market so that system for the Futures market so that one< one usually does very well during a one usually does very well during a crisis< crisis period like 089 financial crisis crisis period like 089 financial crisis uh< uh covid crisis 2022 Russia Ukraine what uh covid crisis 2022 Russia Ukraine what that< that system will do very well so that that system will do very well so that one< one is really covers the backside of the one is really covers the backside of the first< first two system you know stock market first two system you know stock market don't< don't do well the first two system is don't do well the first two system is going< going to do very well so the system like going to do very well so the system like cushion< cushion the losses for the first two cushion the losses for the first two systems< systems during this difficult period systems during this difficult period then< then I have another fourth and fifth then I have another fourth and fifth trading< trading system which is more of a trading system which is more of a shorting< shorting the US Stocks basically shorting the US Stocks basically identifying< identifying stocks that are overbought identifying stocks that are overbought in< in the shortterm then we shot them and in the shortterm then we shot them and then< then we cover them a bit lower so these then we cover them a bit lower so these are< are think the five main trading systems are think the five main trading systems that< that I trade so to clarify when you mean that I trade so to clarify when you mean systematic< systematic trading is it automated systematic trading is it automated trading< trading or is it there still the uh trading or is it there still the uh manual< manual aspect where you you know place manual aspect where you you know place the< the trade by yourself still I would say the trade by yourself still I would say it's< it's uh for this particular systematic it's uh for this particular systematic trading< trading is 95 97% automated at the trading is 95 97% automated at the signals< signals are automated the only thing I signals are automated the only thing I need< need to do is to manually upload those need to do is to manually upload those orders< orders to my broker which is Interactive orders to my broker which is Interactive Broker< Broker so via API I need to press a few Broker so via API I need to press a few clicks< clicks of a button and upload all this clicks of a button and upload all this ERS< ERS each day then to run the scan using ERS each day then to run the scan using the< the software again a few clicks okay so the software again a few clicks okay so I< I think that kind of makes sense because I think that kind of makes sense because uh< uh if you mention like you mentioned you uh if you mention like you mentioned you know< know you've been trading many different know you've been trading many different markets< markets you should be pretty busy right markets you should be pretty busy right if< if you have to trade all the different if you have to trade all the different markets< markets and uh it's pretty much like 24 markets and uh it's pretty much like 24 hours< hours so for someone who let's say they hours so for someone who let's say they have< have a full-time job very hard for them have a full-time job very hard for them to< to implement it or maybe to see the to implement it or maybe to see the signal< signal if it's manual but if it's signal if it's manual but if it's automated< automated you know they can go about automated you know they can go about doing< doing their full-time job and then still doing their full-time job and then still have< have the system running in the have the system running in the background< background is that the idea of this background is that the idea of this systematic< systematic training yes so you need to systematic training yes so you need to pretty< pretty much do your scan before the US pretty much do your scan before the US Market< Market opens for example so you just Market opens for example so you just high< high level overviews every I open up the high level overviews every I open up the data< data click button you download the data click button you download the previous< previous day data then I open up the previous day data then I open up the software< software click the software you give out software click the software you give out the< the signal for the day then a few more the signal for the day then a few more clicks< clicks pick the orders and you know clicks pick the orders and you know calculate< calculate position size few more clicks calculate position size few more clicks upload< upload those orders to Interactive upload those orders to Interactive Broker< Broker probably less than 10 minutes but Broker probably less than 10 minutes but if< if you ask me oh okay so it's actually if you ask me oh okay so it's actually not< not as much time as you need so maybe not as much time as you need so maybe can< can you give a rough idea roughly how can you give a rough idea roughly how many< many you know how long you spend each many you know how long you spend each day< day just to do this trading at this day just to do this trading at this point< point systematic trading probably 10 point systematic trading probably 10 minutes< minutes per day at most but but the minutes per day at most but but the large< large part of the work is all doing the large part of the work is all doing the research< research and development phase which is research and development phase which is way< way in front which what people don't see way in front which what people don't see the< the testing the back testing you know the testing the back testing you know optimizing< optimizing you know making sure the optimizing you know making sure the system< system really works the draw down are system really works the draw down are you< you accepting it thinking P still spend you accepting it thinking P still spend like< like hours and hours of weeks and months like hours and hours of weeks and months then< then you get get to this 10 minute stage then you get get to this 10 minute stage so< so cannot you know cannot uh mislead and so cannot you know cannot uh mislead and let< let people oh it's only 10 minutes I let people oh it's only 10 minutes I mean< mean 10 minutes fair you know I give my mean 10 minutes fair you know I give my system< system you take you 10 minutes per day system you take you 10 minutes per day but< but the downside is that you may not but the downside is that you may not have< have the same conviction as me so again have the same conviction as me so again you< you probably need to spend some time you probably need to spend some time understanding< understanding what is it why it works so understanding what is it why it works so maybe< maybe can you share with me you know how maybe can you share with me you know how long< long actually does it take the process long actually does it take the process from< from the ideation of maybe a strategy from the ideation of maybe a strategy you< you plan to employ and the journey it you plan to employ and the journey it takes< takes to finally say okay this is ready takes to finally say okay this is ready for< for me to put in my real money inside I for me to put in my real money inside I think< think it depends it depends because think it depends it depends because after< after you know so many years of tral after you know so many years of tral every< every you kind of like know what works every you kind of like know what works and< and what don't so but let's say for now and what don't so but let's say for now today< today knowing what I do now I want to today knowing what I do now I want to take< take a new idea uh it won't take very take a new idea uh it won't take very long< long because usually you can get ideas long because usually you can get ideas from< from books podcast whatever you know from books podcast whatever you know take< take the ideas convert it into a set of take the ideas convert it into a set of rules< rules I then hand it to my programmer rules I then hand it to my programmer you're< you're going to give me the code to test you're going to give me the code to test it< it right and see whether it works or not it right and see whether it works or not within< within a few moments I'll know whether within a few moments I'll know whether it< it works or not so sometimes if the idea it works or not so sometimes if the idea works< works the results May not maybe the idea works the results May not maybe the idea might< might work but the results are maybe might work but the results are maybe just< just average we can make further T to just average we can make further T to improve< improve the the returns relative to to improve the the returns relative to to risk< risk right so usually it won't take very risk right so usually it won't take very long< long from ideation to tack testing long from ideation to tack testing because< because you know it's pretty because you know it's pretty straightforward< straightforward at this stage yeah but straightforward at this stage yeah but for< for someone who is maybe new very new for someone who is maybe new very new take< take a lot of time because they do not take a lot of time because they do not know< know what they do not know they don't know what they do not know they don't know< know what a blind spots to check you know what a blind spots to check you know< know sometimes the data they use may not know sometimes the data they use may not even< even be a clean data might be you know even be a clean data might be you know uh< uh data that's faulty so that might take uh data that's faulty so that might take a< a little bit more time yeah yeah that's a little bit more time yeah yeah that's true< true so uh regarding this term back true so uh regarding this term back testing< testing I used to did it you know a long testing I used to did it you know a long long< long time ago do some back testing and long time ago do some back testing and what< what from my understanding of back what from my understanding of back testing< testing is that the data which you use testing is that the data which you use also< also pretty important like what you also pretty important like what you mentioned< mentioned if it's not clean sometimes mentioned if it's not clean sometimes the< the data that comes out it's not really the data that comes out it's not really accurate< accurate and then when you start to accurate and then when you start to trade< trade it you realize that it's it's not trade it you realize that it's it's not really< really conforming to what you actually really conforming to what you actually had< had in your back test so maybe a had in your back test so maybe a question< question to you would be you know after question to you would be you know after the< the back test part where you see that the back test part where you see that okay< okay this is the results you like it do okay this is the results you like it do you< you straight away put real money in a you straight away put real money in a sense< sense where by the real actual size or sense where by the real actual size or do< do you do something like a forward test do you do something like a forward test where< where you try the smallest one for a where you try the smallest one for a period< period of time to see whether it kind of period of time to see whether it kind of confirms< confirms to the back test results you confirms to the back test results you have< have or do you actually just you know have or do you actually just you know see< see the back test result you're see the back test result you're confident< confident of that you just put your confident of that you just put your money< money in there so usually I don't do any money in there so usually I don't do any forward< forward testing usually if I see the forward testing usually if I see the back< back test results it's okay what I like back test results it's okay what I like to< to do is a robust testing so to change a to do is a robust testing so to change a few< few parameters and see how the results few parameters and see how the results differ< differ if after changing a few differ if after changing a few parameters< parameters the whole echoer from going parameters the whole echoer from going outward< outward suddenly collapse it's a outward suddenly collapse it's a something< something is wrong so to me that's something is wrong so to me that's probably< probably cury thing and I wouldn't want probably cury thing and I wouldn't want to< to trade the system so usually after to trade the system so usually after back< back test the results are okay I usually back test the results are okay I usually just< just change the parameters 10 20% just change the parameters 10 20% different< different up and down and see how the EO different up and down and see how the EO curve< curve changes if it just still curve changes if it just still profitable< profitable that gives me more confidence profitable that gives me more confidence then< then I'll trade in the Life markets life then I'll trade in the Life markets life markets< markets I won't use full size yet I markets I won't use full size yet I probably< probably test with 30% of my original probably test with 30% of my original size< size pretty much with didn't expectation size pretty much with didn't expectation I< I slowly scale up then to the full size I slowly scale up then to the full size okay< okay so um if you were to trade the real okay so um if you were to trade the real money< money for this uh systems and you money for this uh systems and you realize< realize that after trading it for some realize that after trading it for some time< time suddenly you see you know maybe the time suddenly you see you know maybe the losing< losing staks have has gone past what the losing staks have has gone past what the test< test results actually show maybe the test results actually show maybe the test< test results shows maybe the maximum test results shows maybe the maximum losing< losing streight maybe is six or seven in losing streight maybe is six or seven in a< a row but suddenly you have like eight a row but suddenly you have like eight in< in row at that point in time do you in row at that point in time do you still< still continue trading it or do you say still continue trading it or do you say oh< oh maybe something is not right you take oh maybe something is not right you take a< a step back reevaluate again walk me a step back reevaluate again walk me through< through that process so this one through that process so this one actually< actually I'm still struggling with this actually I'm still struggling with this right< right so I think what happened is during right so I think what happened is during covid< covid one of my trading systems covid one of my trading systems previously< previously the max thrown was about 23 previously the max thrown was about 23 22< 22 23% during Co went up to 30 close to 22 23% during Co went up to 30 close to 35< 35 so point I'm like wow should I still 35 so point I'm like wow should I still continue< continue because it really exceeds the continue because it really exceeds the maximum< maximum draw Down based on the back test maximum draw Down based on the back test but< but one thing I also do know that your but one thing I also do know that your maximum< maximum draw down is always in the maximum draw down is always in the future< future it's never in the back test right future it's never in the back test right so< so fortunately for that period the so fortunately for that period the recovery< recovery was equally faster because the recovery was equally faster because the covid< covid crashed down the spike up was then covid crashed down the spike up was then fast< fast so I followed the rules of the fast so I followed the rules of the system< system and within like few months we got system and within like few months we got off< off the draw down but if you ask me off the draw down but if you ask me right< right let's say if we didn't get out the right let's say if we didn't get out the draw< draw down within a few months prolonged draw down within a few months prolonged to< to like eight months a year 1. 5 years to like eight months a year 1.

5 years would< would I still continue trading system would I still continue trading system probably< probably not yeah and so this is why probably not yeah and so this is why recently< recently I also learned a very important recently I also learned a very important concept< concept from my from actually my concept from my from actually my programmer< programmer Cesar Alvarez is a qu Trader programmer Cesar Alvarez is a qu Trader as< as well asking the same question what if as well asking the same question what if one< one day you know your trading system one day you know your trading system stops< stops working how do you you don't get stops working how do you you don't get caught< caught with the system that stops caught with the system that stops working< working so he Shar with me with me this working so he Shar with me with me this concept< concept that really you know wow you concept that really you know wow you know< know that I Implement today so basically know that I Implement today so basically he< he says that he has a portfolio of he says that he has a portfolio of trading< trading system let's say for example he trading system let's say for example he has< has 10 right but he doesn't trade all 10 has 10 right but he doesn't trade all 10 so< so what he does right is that he would so what he does right is that he would every< every I don't know what his exact every I don't know what his exact parameters< parameters but the concept is every parameters but the concept is every month< month or every quarter you'll review the month or every quarter you'll review the performance< performance of these trading systems he performance of these trading systems he only< only trade the let's say for example the only trade the let's say for example the top< top five performing ones the five that top five performing ones the five that doesn't< doesn't perform as well he will not doesn't perform as well he will not trade< trade them so when you do this on the trade them so when you do this on the when< when you do this so-call rebalancing on when you do this so-call rebalancing on a< a regular basis you will never end up a regular basis you will never end up with< with the trading system that stops with the trading system that stops working< working because you always with the best working because you always with the best five< five trading systems per se so yeah this five trading systems per se so yeah this makes< makes a lot of sense so that's something makes a lot of sense so that's something that< that I strive to do now just pick the that I strive to do now just pick the best< best few trading systems to trade those best few trading systems to trade those that< that don't perform as well keep it at that don't perform as well keep it at the< the side because if it's really going to the side because if it's really going to go< go with a really bad draw now this go with a really bad draw now this concept< concept will you know make me stay away concept will you know make me stay away from< from it so that's very interesting from it so that's very interesting concept< concept that uh you just mentioned concept that uh you just mentioned because< because it's almost very similar to how because it's almost very similar to how the< the ETFs they actually decide what they the ETFs they actually decide what they put< put inside right they always see you put inside right they always see you know< know which are the Performing ones then know which are the Performing ones then those< those that's not performing they kick it those that's not performing they kick it out< out of it so they'll always be the ones out of it so they'll always be the ones that< that are doing well inside the ETF those that are doing well inside the ETF those that< that didn't really do well they take it that didn't really do well they take it out< out so will there be at any time where out so will there be at any time where you< you revisit those that don't do well you revisit those that don't do well again< again and then maybe might choose to put again and then maybe might choose to put that< that back in or is it once it's taken that back in or is it once it's taken out< out you don't revisit them again from me out you don't revisit them again from me I< I like to read visit my old systems from I like to read visit my old systems from time< time to time to see how it's performing time to time to see how it's performing you< you know in recent Market condition but you know in recent Market condition but still< still I think the criteria is quite still I think the criteria is quite strict< strict life let's say I only want to strict life let's say I only want to pick< pick the top five that he has to pick the top five that he has to re-qualify< re-qualify back to the top five I I re-qualify back to the top five I I judge< judge it based on the year-to date judge it based on the year-to date return< return right to make sure that to judge return right to make sure that to judge the< the performance so if your year-to date the performance so if your year-to date return< return is not in the top five then I won return is not in the top five then I won be< be trading you yeah so one thing I be trading you yeah so one thing I emphasize< emphasize quite a bit in my YouTube emphasize quite a bit in my YouTube videos< videos is that you know losses will come videos is that you know losses will come and< and especially losing streaks will come and especially losing streaks will come right< right and especially in options trading right and especially in options trading we< we already know based on the strategy we we already know based on the strategy we construct< construct what is like the rough win construct what is like the rough win rate< rate and then from there we can kind of rate and then from there we can kind of see< see you know what's the losing streak so see you know what's the losing streak so I< I want to know you know how do you I want to know you know how do you handle< handle losing streaks these days it got handle losing streaks these days it got a< a lot better because I trade multiple a lot better because I trade multiple trading< trading systems so the losing streak the trading systems so the losing streak the draw< draw down is a lot lesser compared to draw down is a lot lesser compared to let's< let's say just trading one system so let's say just trading one system so previously< previously I was just trading let's say previously I was just trading let's say one< one system like Trend following only one system like Trend following only like< like 40 45% winning rate your losing like 40 45% winning rate your losing streak< streak can be like months or some even streak can be like months or some even years< years especially one system so that one years especially one system so that one how< how do you overcome it is that you how do you overcome it is that you really< really must be super confident of the really must be super confident of the trading< trading system that you're trading trading system that you're trading you're< you're not convinced after few months of you're not convinced after few months of losses< losses you that's it I'm out of here so losses you that's it I'm out of here so so< so Trend following how I stick with this so Trend following how I stick with this I'm< I'm so I'm so bought into it because of I'm so I'm so bought into it because of people< people have been doing it for like people have been doing it for like decades< decades you know Mary Capital all the decades you know Mary Capital all the Big< Big H funds been for so long so I I'm Big H funds been for so long so I I'm very< very certain it works but of course very certain it works but of course sometimes< sometimes the the the length of the draw sometimes the the the length of the draw out< out can know can uh bring you down out can know can uh bring you down emotionally< emotionally and psychologically so this emotionally and psychologically so this is< is where having multiple trading systems is where having multiple trading systems work< work because just because this work because just because this particular< particular system is not doing well at particular system is not doing well at this< this moment doesn't mean that other this moment doesn't mean that other trading< trading systems are doing poorly so trading systems are doing poorly so having< having multiple trading systems do help having multiple trading systems do help with< with this draw down period it basically with this draw down period it basically shortens< shortens your draw down period and you shortens your draw down period and you can< can kind of sleep better at night so can kind of sleep better at night so it's< it's almost like diversification in a it's almost like diversification in a sense< sense right you have multiple systems so sense right you have multiple systems so this< this way if one doesn't do well at least this way if one doesn't do well at least the< the others and of course they have to be the others and of course they have to be trading< trading differently right not like every trading differently right not like every single< single one is a trend trading because if single one is a trend trading because if that's< that's the case everyone will all be hit that's the case everyone will all be hit if< if the market goes choppy so you have if the market goes choppy so you have maybe< maybe one's Trend following and then maybe one's Trend following and then other< other system capture different you know other system capture different you know types< types of uh movements in the market so types of uh movements in the market so at< at least the equity curve kind of at least the equity curve kind of smoothed< smoothed out over the long term is that smoothed out over the long term is that the< the idea behind that yep exactly yeah the idea behind that yep exactly yeah okay< okay sometimes by trading other markets okay sometimes by trading other markets as< as well like opportunities that the as well like opportunities that the trend< trend following markets didn't cover you trend following markets didn't cover you could< could you know take advantage of the could you know take advantage of the conditions< conditions of other markets like stocks conditions of other markets like stocks and< and Forex Commodities they quite and Forex Commodities they quite uncorrelated< uncorrelated so it's you know great to uncorrelated so it's you know great to have< have different exposure to this have different exposure to this different< different markets so let's say for different markets so let's say for somebody< somebody who is brand new to System somebody who is brand new to System trading< trading and they want to kind of get trading and they want to kind of get their< their feedb right just to try it would their feedb right just to try it would you< you suggest they trade also many systems you suggest they trade also many systems right< right at the start or just one what right at the start or just one what would< would you suggest just one because at would you suggest just one because at the< the start if they so many they'll be the start if they so many they'll be overwhelmed< overwhelmed and they'll overwhelmed and they'll. probably< probably be more prone to errors and probably be more prone to errors and that< that be more costly so just take the one that be more costly so just take the one system< system one simple trading system prove system one simple trading system prove to< to yourself that you can follow the to yourself that you can follow the rules< rules of the trading system if you prove rules of the trading system if you prove yourself< yourself that you can do it then slowly yourself that you can do it then slowly consider< consider adding a second one yeah the consider adding a second one yeah the next< next question I want to ask you is on next question I want to ask you is on trading< trading for living so I actually do get trading for living so I actually do get this< this question quite a bit a lot of uh my this question quite a bit a lot of uh my audience< audience they are towards their audience they are towards their retirement< retirement years and they want to look retirement years and they want to look to< to trading to replace their current to trading to replace their current income< income so I'd like to hear from you you income so I'd like to hear from you you know< know what's your take on it and also know what's your take on it and also when< when do you think is the right time for when do you think is the right time for someone< someone to transition to it or whether someone to transition to it or whether should< should they even transition to full-time should they even transition to full-time trading< trading at all so for me personally I trading at all so for me personally I don't< don't rely on one source of income I don't rely on one source of income I have< have multiple source of income right now have multiple source of income right now YouTube< YouTube courses trading and stuff like YouTube courses trading and stuff like that< that so if you ask me whether if someone that so if you ask me whether if someone just< just want to transit to trading for a just want to transit to trading for a living< living and just to rely on one this living and just to rely on one this source< source of income then really source of income then really psychologically< psychologically right you are going to psychologically right you are going to be< be there's a lot of pressure compared to be there's a lot of pressure compared to someone< someone who has multiple source of someone who has multiple source of income< income so I can't speak to them because income so I can't speak to them because I< I am not in that position right now I am not in that position right now right< right so but what I would do if I were right so but what I would do if I were in< in that position is I would definitely in that position is I would definitely need< need to allocate uh money for my living need to allocate uh money for my living expenses< expenses on a separate account let's see expenses on a separate account let's see 12< 12 months 24 months whatever number that 12 months 24 months whatever number that you're< you're comfortable with right I think you're comfortable with right I think ideally< ideally at least 18 months that money ideally at least 18 months that money will< will fund your living expenses then the will fund your living expenses then the remaining< remaining money is probably in your remaining money is probably in your trading< trading account make sure it's also trading account make sure it's also sufficiently< sufficiently large enough that it can sufficiently large enough that it can generate< generate a return that makes sense to generate a return that makes sense to you< you so for example if you want to trade you so for example if you want to trade for< for a living with let's say $220,000 in for a living with let's say $220,000 in Singapore< Singapore not possible Right you're Singapore not possible Right you're doing< doing like what 300% a year which is doing like what 300% a year which is very< very unlikely right consistently so you very unlikely right consistently so you probably< probably need a six figure account size probably need a six figure account size also< also depending on your skills a Traer also depending on your skills a Traer what< what kind of returns that you can what kind of returns that you can deliver< deliver right to kind of like to to to deliver right to kind of like to to to sustain< sustain your retirement yeah so so yeah sustain your retirement yeah so so yeah I< I think probably you set aside funds to I think probably you set aside funds to meet< meet your needs plus making sure that meet your needs plus making sure that your< your account size is sufficiently large your account size is sufficiently large enough< enough to to meet for your retirement enough to to meet for your retirement now< now the next thing I want to ask you is now the next thing I want to ask you is how< how important would you say A person's how important would you say A person's mindset< mindset is to do well in trading even in mindset is to do well in trading even in System< System trading where most part is System trading where most part is automated automated automated I< I think as a Trader or any other endeav I think as a Trader or any other endeav you< you have to persevere because the the you have to persevere because the the learning< learning curve is quite steep right now learning curve is quite steep right now you< you looking back you a good few years you looking back you a good few years and< and and if you're in it just to make the and and if you're in it just to make the money< money and not so much of the know the money and not so much of the know the interest< interest the passion to learn what the interest the passion to learn what the market< market is about then you probably give market is about then you probably give up< up after a few months right so I think up after a few months right so I think number< number one is that you got to have at number one is that you got to have at least< least an interest in this field right in least an interest in this field right in what< what you're doing because if you don't what you're doing because if you don't have< have this interest right the losses the have this interest right the losses the draw< draw down is going to weigh out very draw down is going to weigh out very quickly< quickly so I think that's that's number quickly so I think that's that's number one< one number two it's I think do manage one number two it's I think do manage expectations< expectations you com very lofty expectations you com very lofty expectations< expectations then you might be maybe a expectations then you might be maybe a pretty< pretty decent Trader you may aage I pretty decent Trader you may aage I don't< don't know 20 25% a year but you think don't know 20 25% a year but you think it's< it's not good enough I should be doing it's not good enough I should be doing 100< 100 200% like those social media Traders 100 200% like those social media Traders again< again your lofy expectations is going to again your lofy expectations is going to you< you know make you feel lousy about you know make you feel lousy about yourself< yourself and actual fact he actually yourself and actual fact he actually pretty< pretty done decent already so I think pretty done decent already so I think yeah< yeah those two comes to mind so on this yeah those two comes to mind so on this topic< topic of you know what makes a good topic of you know what makes a good Trader< Trader in your experience right you've Trader in your experience right you've gone< gone through trading for quite some time gone through trading for quite some time you've< you've been in the prop trading firm and you've been in the prop trading firm and you've< you've helped quite a number of people you've helped quite a number of people already< already right in your own courses your already right in your own courses your mentorship< mentorship as well what do you see right mentorship as well what do you see right that< that you think you know makees someone that you think you know makees someone at< at least have a good chance of doing at least have a good chance of doing well< well in this trading Endeavor I think well in this trading Endeavor I think number< number one is you have to be able number one is you have to be able to< to follow I want say follow the rules I to follow I want say follow the rules I mean< mean for system Str you have to follow mean for system Str you have to follow the< the the rules but there are times where the the rules but there are times where you< you also must have the initiative to you also must have the initiative to always< always want to be a a student of the always want to be a a student of the markets< markets where you I mean some of the markets where you I mean some of the best< best Traders I know they always learning best Traders I know they always learning they< they never stop learning just because they never stop learning just because they're< they're profitable they always learning they're profitable they always learning because< because they're just genuinely curious because they're just genuinely curious about< about the market so some of the best about the market so some of the best Traders< Traders I know just have this trade just Traders I know just have this trade just always< always curious all the time about always curious all the time about markets< markets how can I you know exploit this markets how can I you know exploit this inefficiency< inefficiency how can I make my system inefficiency how can I make my system better< better and blah blah blah so to me better and blah blah blah so to me that's< that's a homework of a great Trader how that's a homework of a great Trader how can< can someone be a profitable Trader my can someone be a profitable Trader my students< students really I just want them to just students really I just want them to just follow< follow the rules right just signal is follow the rules right just signal is there< there just take it right don't let your there just take it right don't let your emotions< emotions override the rules if you can emotions override the rules if you can do< do this long enough right there's no do this long enough right there's no reason< reason why you know you can't be a reason why you know you can't be a profitable< profitable Trader okay Nick so I profitable Trader okay Nick so I understand< understand you have three young kids uh understand you have three young kids uh how< how old are they at the moment no they how old are they at the moment no they eight< eight five eight five 863< 863 I think so still still pretty young 863 I think so still still pretty young so< so uh how do you actually juggle your so uh how do you actually juggle your time< time like like with trading you know time like like with trading you know your< your YouTube channel your students as your YouTube channel your students as well< well and spending time with our family well and spending time with our family maybe< maybe can you just give me an idea of maybe can you just give me an idea of that< that so my trading the right we'll start that so my trading the right we'll start around< around 9 plus a. m where one of my guy around 9 plus a.

m where one of my guy right< right chat right helps me run one of my right chat right helps me run one of my trading< trading systems because as I said right trading systems because as I said right a< a last before we do is uh uh systematic a last before we do is uh uh systematic so< so he has the tools to help me run the so he has the tools to help me run the system< system in terms of running the scans and system in terms of running the scans and then< then placing the order so he'll do it on then placing the order so he'll do it on my< my behalf instead of me doing it so my behalf instead of me doing it so freeze< freeze up some of my time over there so freeze up some of my time over there so that< that one is covered right then usually that one is covered right then usually when< when I come back uh if I have work to do when I come back uh if I have work to do in< in terms of creative work usually is in terms of creative work usually is more< more of a the books and stuff like more of a the books and stuff like writing< writing but some of the other creativ writing but some of the other creativ part< part is also working with the programmer part is also working with the programmer to< to develop new trading system so to develop new trading system so sometimes< sometimes I need to think down know like sometimes I need to think down know like let's< let's say I have a trading idea I need let's say I have a trading idea I need to< to convert it into a set of rules I need to convert it into a set of rules I need to< to think sit down and think through how to think sit down and think through how do< do I take that idea and quantify into an do I take that idea and quantify into an objective< objective set so that take sometime a objective set so that take sometime a bit< bit of creative work as well so once I bit of creative work as well so once I convert< convert it to a set of rules I then just convert it to a set of rules I then just pass< pass it to my programmer programmer then pass it to my programmer programmer then a< a few days later he'll send me back the a few days later he'll send me back the code< code and then I can take the source code code and then I can take the source code and< and run it on the software and see how's and run it on the software and see how's the< the back test result so that's another the back test result so that's another thing< thing I do pretty regularly and then uh thing I do pretty regularly and then uh few< few times few times May< May once or twice a month now I shoot a May once or twice a month now I shoot a YouTube< YouTube video uh because I think been YouTube video uh because I think been doing< doing it for quite a. while now so I doing it for quite a while now so I don't< don't do it as often now because I think don't do it as often now because I think uh< uh a little bit burn out to be honest uh a little bit burn out to be honest right< right you know doing the same thing you right you know doing the same thing you know< know for 10 years so right now I'm in a know for 10 years so right now I'm in a phase< phase where you know ask myself what phase where you know ask myself what other< other type of YouTube videos do I want other type of YouTube videos do I want to< to do what trading videos do I want to to do what trading videos do I want to do< do right what kind of concept what kind do right what kind of concept what kind of< of know educational videos I to put out of know educational videos I to put out so< so that one uh I'm still kind of like so that one uh I'm still kind of like strategizing< strategizing I think have a few ideas on strategizing I think have a few ideas on my< my top my list and right now I'm trying my top my list and right now I'm trying to< to publish maybe one two videos per to publish maybe one two videos per month< month right not not as often as last month right not not as often as last time< time so after that I think comes lunch time so after that I think comes lunch then< then I I work out usually before lunch then I I work out usually before lunch right< right after lunch do a b more creative right after lunch do a b more creative work< work uh I'm a very fun of taking naps I work uh I'm a very fun of taking naps I like< like to take NPS almost every day like to take NPS almost every day because< because I think because I wake up pretty because I think because I wake up pretty early< early each day so NEP helps me my day early each day so NEP helps me my day and< and then you know more creative work I and then you know more creative work I work< work a lot around my blog and before I work a lot around my blog and before I know< know the kids are home spend time with know the kids are home spend time with them< them and I'm usually quite uh often in them and I'm usually quite uh often in front< front of my computer so sometimes emails front of my computer so sometimes emails comes< comes in I to reply uh needs help comes in I to reply uh needs help students< students asking questions I reply along students asking questions I reply along the< the way uh my trading hours before us the way uh my trading hours before us Market< Market opening to run some scans share Market opening to run some scans share with< with you earlier for about 10 minutes y with you earlier for about 10 minutes y so<

that one to run scin upload the orders< orders before the US Market opens so all orders before the US Market opens so all in< in all generally this is kind of my life in all generally this is kind of my life right< right now yeah okay so you mentioned right now yeah okay so you mentioned about< about the US market do you actually stay about the US market do you actually stay up< up late or is it only after you upload up late or is it only after you upload the< the data you let it run then you go the data you let it run then you go about< about do your own stuff I don't stay up about do your own stuff I don't stay up. late< late because I know the orders are I late because I know the orders are I mean< mean the systems already in place right mean the systems already in place right so< so those that need to close before the so those that need to close before the US< US market close the API should do it but US market close the API should do it but there< there are times you know sometimes the there are times you know sometimes the API< API just screws up something my PC API just screws up something my PC automatically< automatically shut down so I have this automatically shut down so I have this habit< habit now of waking up every around 4:00 habit now of waking up every around 4:00 5< 5 a. m.

I would just wake up to check my 5 a. m.

I would just wake up to check my position< position make sure everything should be position make sure everything should be the< the way it is right because even. though the way it is right because even though the< the US market now closes at I think 400 the US market now closes at I think 400 a. m.

< a. m.

#### Topic 1

you can actually exit position up a. m.

you can actually exit position up to< to up to 8 a. m.

right after market hour to up to 8 a. m.

right after market hour so< so usually after few Windows few hours so usually after few Windows few hours if< if right somehow or other the positions if right somehow or other the positions are< are not exited or not doing well I are not exited or not doing well I exited< exited after market I was paid at exited after market I was paid at horrible< horrible spread and then just get out horrible spread and then just get out the< the tree yeah so you mentioned something the tree yeah so you mentioned something very< very interesting that you know you're very interesting that you know you're afraid< afraid the computer crash because you're afraid the computer crash because you're doing< doing the system training so is this doing the system training so is this system< system training very dependent on your system training very dependent on your computer< computer actually being up or can you do computer actually being up or can you do it< it something like a VPN you know where it something like a VPN you know where it's< it's always 24 hours you can do it on it's always 24 hours you can do it on the< the VPS I think I actually I do have the VPS I think I actually I do have have< have that but I find it's a bit slow and have that but I find it's a bit slow and clunky< clunky I usually use the VPS when I'm clunky I usually use the VPS when I'm overseas< overseas right I don't have success to overseas right I don't have success to this< this computer but otherwise when I'm this computer but otherwise when I'm here< here I will use my own computer here here I will use my own computer here even< even though there's a risk of this this even though there's a risk of this this thing< thing going down it rarely happens right thing going down it rarely happens right it's< it's usually more of the the somehow the it's usually more of the the somehow the the< the API like so for example we talk a the API like so for example we talk a little< little bit about researching trading little bit about researching trading systems< systems working the programmer yeah systems working the programmer yeah there's< there's another set of programmer I work there's another set of programmer I work with< with to make sure that API is running with to make sure that API is running smoothly< smoothly so they also spend a lot of smoothly so they also spend a lot of money< money running the API creating the API money running the API creating the API from< from scratch you know so then every time from scratch you know so then every time you< you add new features is get new testing you add new features is get new testing like< like oh my goodness so so yeah something like oh my goodness so so yeah something API< API do do let me down so I also still API do do let me down so I also still have< have to check so it seems there's have to check so it seems there's actually< actually quite a bit of work but if for actually quite a bit of work but if for someone< someone just new to systems trading do someone just new to systems trading do they< they have to do all this no no of course they have to do all this no no of course not< not this because I the API comes in not this because I the API comes in because< because I have certain uh intraday because I have certain uh intraday trading< trading systems where the positions trading systems where the positions needs< needs to close let's say 10 minutes needs to close let's say 10 minutes before< before the market closes because I I before the market closes because I I don't< don't stay awake manually close I want don't stay awake manually close I want API< API to run it so sometimes the API API to run it so sometimes the API closes< closes the wrong position or closes the closes the wrong position or closes the wrong< wrong number of stocks and stuff as we wrong number of stocks and stuff as we we've< we've been you know tweaking it to we've been you know tweaking it to making< making sure that it closes the right making sure that it closes the right number< number of stocks that we buy yeah okay number of stocks that we buy yeah okay so< so this API uh basically it has to work so this API uh basically it has to work according< according to what is being programmed according to what is being programmed otherwise< otherwise you know the the the trading otherwise you know the the the trading system< system won't work as plan is that system won't work as plan is that correct< correct yes correct okay so I think correct yes correct okay so I think there's< there's you know you really have to make there's you know you really have to make sure< sure based on the programmers that they sure based on the programmers that they are< are actually doing you know properly so are actually doing you know properly so that< that your systems can run because you're that your systems can run because you're running< running real money down there yeah and running real money down there yeah and the< the programmer sometimes you know I mean the programmer sometimes you know I mean it< it sounds simple to just close positions it sounds simple to just close positions like< like say 10 minutes before the market like say 10 minutes before the market closing< closing but sometimes you know you run closing but sometimes you know you run multiple< multiple trading systems you might buy multiple trading systems you might buy multiple< multiple stocks then let's say you want multiple stocks then let's say you want to< to close the position only for this to close the position only for this particular< particular system and not this system so particular system and not this system so the< the a will get confused so you need to the a will get confused so you need to explain< explain breakdown is only for this explain breakdown is only for this system< system and not this one so this is where system and not this one so this is where the< the complexity ends up but but your the complexity ends up but but your question< question earlier doesn't new retail question earlier doesn't new retail Trader< Trader need to get all this get involved Trader need to get all this get involved no< no right because this is like more of no right because this is like more of like< like systematic intraday trading I like systematic intraday trading I rather< rather recommend they start with like rather recommend they start with like trading< trading systems that have positions trading systems that have positions running< running for a few days a few weeks or running for a few days a few weeks or even< even a few months they don't require even a few months they don't require much< much less complexity way easier to much less complexity way easier to execute< execute just manually click enough to execute just manually click enough to need< need all this complexity at it now the need all this complexity at it now the next< next thing maybe can you share me does next thing maybe can you share me does your< your children do they know your your your children do they know your your trading< trading and having this uh YouTube trading and having this uh YouTube channel< channel no I don't think so they don't channel no I don't think so they don't know< know what I what I do for they just see know what I what I do for they just see why< why my home every day and they thought why my home every day and they thought that< that a job unemployed we didn't really that a job unemployed we didn't really explain< explain much to them and we just kind of explain much to them and we just kind of left< left it as it is okay so do you hope left it as it is okay so do you hope your< your children in future f in your your children in future f in your footsteps< footsteps right maybe to do trading as footsteps right maybe to do trading as well< well in a sense I think trading is a a well in a sense I think trading is a a is< is a great skill to learn right if they is a great skill to learn right if they have< have interest they're passionate for it have interest they're passionate for it I< I would definitely encourage them to to I would definitely encourage them to to learn< learn it but if they find it yeah it's learn it but if they find it yeah it's not< not meant for me I I won't force it on not meant for me I I won't force it on them< them as well but yeah I think it's a them as well but yeah I think it's a great< great skill to acquire so what if one great skill to acquire so what if one day< day your children maybe University right day your children maybe University right there< there was get to find out about trading there was get to find out about trading same< same like you as well and they suddenly same like you as well and they suddenly say< say to you Daddy I like trading so much say to you Daddy I like trading so much I'm< I'm going to quit my studies I want to I'm going to quit my studies I want to do< do trading full-time what would you say do trading full-time what would you say to< to that I would give them the same to that I would give them the same support< support that my parents give to me that support that my parents give to me that you< you know I they don't need my I don't you know I they don't need my I don't need< need their money to to to survive but I need their money to to to survive but I wouldn't< wouldn't necessarily give them money to wouldn't necessarily give them money to say< say start their own trading or funing say start their own trading or funing own< own account or rather they go there and own account or rather they go there and rais< rais their own money on the own to rais their own money on the own to understand< understand the value of money rather understand the value of money rather than< than just you know SP feed them the than just you know SP feed them the money< money the capital yeah so that means you money the capital yeah so that means you still< still want them to know that you know no still want them to know that you know no free< free lunch so to speak if you want to do free lunch so to speak if you want to do this< this trading you definitely have to go this trading you definitely have to go out< out and still earn the money find your out and still earn the money find your own< own account and then still trade but own account and then still trade but will< will you at least at them in a sense will you at least at them in a sense whereby< whereby you know what works what don't whereby you know what works what don't work< work you just tell them yeah just trade work you just tell them yeah just trade this< this that kind or would you want them to this that kind or would you want them to discover< discover you know the ups and downs the discover you know the ups and downs the Journey< Journey of trading by themselves I think Journey of trading by themselves I think it< it would help that I will share with it would help that I will share with them< them at least some Concepts that maybe them at least some Concepts that maybe you< you know if 10 years later it still you know if 10 years later it still works< works right I sh hey you know this works right I sh hey you know this Concepts< Concepts you know been using for ex Concepts you know been using for ex number< number of years is working even until number of years is working even until today< today you might want to explore it but today you might want to explore it but of< of course this is not the N orb or there of course this is not the N orb or there other< other things out there like maybe other things out there like maybe options< options trading or whatever right I've options trading or whatever right I've never< never touched before this is again never touched before this is again opportunities< opportunities for you to go and explore opportunities for you to go and explore you< you know since you guys are still new you know since you guys are still new okay< okay so in closing I have a few final okay so in closing I have a few final questions< questions so uh one of the questions I questions so uh one of the questions I get< get a lot like I mentioned is regarding get a lot like I mentioned is regarding retirement< retirement so imagine that you are also retirement so imagine that you are also you< you know pushing your retirement years you know pushing your retirement years uh< uh how would you actually trade if you uh how would you actually trade if you were< were approaching retirement or in your were approaching retirement or in your retirement< retirement years would it be any retirement years would it be any different< different from what you're doing now if different from what you're doing now if so< so how would it be like H I think when so how would it be like H I think when it< it comes to retirement you definitely it comes to retirement you definitely want< want to lower the the draw down you want to lower the the draw down you don't< don't want to be like having maximum don't want to be like having maximum draw< draw down of like what 30 40 50% it's draw down of like what 30 40 50% it's just< just way too high so it's probably not just way too high so it's probably not more< more than 15 or 20% that's that's for me more than 15 or 20% that's that's for me I< I think a number that I'm comfortable I think a number that I'm comfortable with< with and definitely also split the with and definitely also split the number< number of systems that I'm trading number of systems that I'm trading Maybe< Maybe probably I won't be doing any much Maybe probably I won't be doing any much changes< changes because right changes because right now< now depending on different market now depending on different market conditions< conditions one of two of my systems will conditions one of two of my systems will likely< likely do well in this I probably won't likely do well in this I probably won't do< do much changes to it maybe what I'll do do much changes to it maybe what I'll do is< is maybe pull out some funds and then is maybe pull out some funds and then maybe< maybe just buy and hold the maybe just buy and hold the index< index. be more passive right and and and index be more passive right and and and and< and and and just in and and and just in case< case I mean I not buy the index as well case I mean I not buy the index as well because< because you know why would I buy the because you know why would I buy the index< index when the trading has lower RIS and index when the trading has lower RIS and higher< higher return So yeah so I think I higher return So yeah so I think I probably< probably won't do much changes to it probably won't do much changes to it yeah< yeah maybe yeah maybe risk< risk lower level of risk right instead risk lower level of risk right instead maybe< maybe I don't know one 2% but might want maybe I don't know one 2% but might want to< to dial back down the risk have some to dial back down the risk have some money< money in bonds so you got something uh money in bonds so you got something uh consistent< consistent coming in terms of an income consistent coming in terms of an income Yeah< Yeah so basically more like uh geared Yeah so basically more like uh geared towards< towards income and also slightly lower towards income and also slightly lower risk< risk right not too big of a w risk right not too big of a w fluctuation< fluctuation so maybe Trend following fluctuation so maybe Trend following would< would you say it's something that would would you say it's something that would be< be something that somebody would look be something that somebody would look into< into in retirement even though that you into in retirement even though that you know< know the the win rate is not that high know the the win rate is not that high so< so the draw down can be quite long like so the draw down can be quite long like you< you say would you say that falls into it you say would you say that falls into it or< or better something else no TR is a bad or better something else no TR is a bad idea< idea for for it for for recurring income idea for for it for for recurring income trf< trf is good for Building Wealth right in trf is good for Building Wealth right in terms< terms of let's say you won need the terms of let's say you won need the money< money for the next 10 15 20 years okay money for the next 10 15 20 years okay yeah< yeah fair enough Trend flowing Trend yeah fair enough Trend flowing Trend flow< flow is good for those of you who uh flow is good for those of you who uh want< want something to cushion during want something to cushion during recession< recession that's good but regular income recession that's good but regular income I< I would say probably from a systematic I would say probably from a systematic standpoint< standpoint I think mean reversion standpoint I think mean reversion trading< trading is one that comes to mind so me trading is one that comes to mind so me inversion< inversion trading the idea behind it inversion trading the idea behind it especially< especially in the stock market uh realm especially in the stock market uh realm is< is more of like identifying stocks that is more of like identifying stocks that in< in uptrend buy the pullback sell the in uptrend buy the pullback sell the rally< rally why that is good for income is rally why that is good for income is because< because the wind rate is pretty high I because the wind rate is pretty high I think< think close to 70% 60 plus 70% so that think close to 70% 60 plus 70% so that consistency< consistency would helps with the the consistency would helps with the the peace< peace of mind right for people who who peace of mind right for people who who want< want that recurring income the downside want that recurring income the downside is< is your losses are usually larger than is your losses are usually larger than your< your winners not by a lot but they they your winners not by a lot but they they are< are slightly larger so that's the are slightly larger so that's the downside< downside but I guess the consistency downside but I guess the consistency would< would help with people wanting to earn would help with people wanting to earn that< that consistent income so it seems like that consistent income so it seems like uh< uh similar to options trading there's uh similar to options trading there's always< always like a trade-off right to have always like a trade-off right to have the< the high win rate uh you have to at the high win rate uh you have to at least< least have slightly bigger risk to least have slightly bigger risk to compare< compare to your reward right and for compare to your reward right and for Trend< Trend trolling Trend following is the Trend trolling Trend following is the opposite< opposite although you have a low win opposite although you have a low win rate< rate you actually have a very big reward rate you actually have a very big reward compared< compared to the RIS yeah yep so if you compared to the RIS yeah yep so if you could< could turn back time to any point in could turn back time to any point in your< your time in life to do things your time in life to do things differently< differently which part of time you know differently which part of time you know in< in your life would you go back to what in your life would you go back to what would< would you do differently and why most of would you do differently and why most of the< the time I would say that you know I I the time I would say that you know I I don't< don't want to do anything differently don't want to do anything differently because< because every difficulties every because every difficulties every hardship< hardship failures hardship failures always< always a lesson behind it right so always a lesson behind it right so usually< usually I would say That's my kind of usually I would say That's my kind of like< like default template answer but now like default template answer but now right< right now in this chair if you ask me I right now in this chair if you ask me I think< think one thing that if I really could think one thing that if I really could do< do I would say you know to really take do I would say you know to really take good< good care of the the body my human body good care of the the body my human body because< because right now I have a few injuries because right now I have a few injuries on< on my end and I wish that you know if I on my end and I wish that you know if I had< had done things better I've been more had done things better I've been more aware< aware I've been taught uh the proper way aware I've been taught uh the proper way to< to like LIF weights I won have to be to like LIF weights I won have to be going< going through this injuries that I'm going through this injuries that I'm going< going through right now right and this going through right now right and this is< is injuries that last quite a while so I is injuries that last quite a while so I think< think like time this something I would think like time this something I would want< want to change right yeah okay so if want to change right yeah okay so if there's< there's one piece of advice you can give there's one piece of advice you can give for< for people starting out and in trading for people starting out and in trading right< right to at least give them a good right to at least give them a good chance< chance a decent chance to do well in chance a decent chance to do well in this< this trading Endeavor what would that this trading Endeavor what would that one< one piece of advice be so I think for me one piece of advice be so I think for me one< one advice I think it's not just apply one advice I think it's not just apply to< to trading but in life in general is to trading but in life in general is that< that uh the concept of reverse that uh the concept of reverse engineering< engineering if you see someone has the engineering if you see someone has the soal< soal level of success that you desire soal level of success that you desire right< right that you want just reverse right that you want just reverse engineer< engineer the their process so takes engineer the their process so takes trading< trading for example you want to be a trading for example you want to be a profitable< profitable Trader and you know people profitable Trader and you know people who< who have done it like genuine people who who have done it like genuine people who have< have you know really made money trading have you know really made money trading just< just reverse engineer their process I just reverse engineer their process I think< think most traders that I've come across think most traders that I've come across the< the more successful they as a Trader the the more successful they as a Trader the more< more they actually willing to share more they actually willing to share maybe< maybe those that don't really want to maybe those that don't really want to share< share maybe share maybe those< those very uh quantitative trading for those very uh quantitative trading for funds< funds on a very low time frame right you funds on a very low time frame right you know< know and stuff like that where they are know and stuff like that where they are you< you know bounded by certain contracts you know bounded by certain contracts they< they can't share but most people that they can't share but most people that come< come across yeah you know they they're come across yeah you know they they're profitable< profitable they're willing to usually profitable they're willing to usually share< share so reverse engineer they their share so reverse engineer they their process< process the concepts right on how they process the concepts right on how they reach< reach that stage like what are the reach that stage like what are the strategies< strategies that they use not don't have strategies that they use not don't have to< to know what is the exact entries and to know what is the exact entries and exits< exits but have an idea a concept to the exits but have an idea a concept to the strategies< strategies that they are trading and strategies that they are trading and then< then try to formulate your own base on then try to formulate your own base on those< those Concepts go and you know test it those Concepts go and you know test it out< out right and then just reverse engineer out right and then just reverse engineer the< the the process you know same thing for the the process you know same thing for losing< losing weight how do people lose weight losing weight how do people lose weight it's< it's probably through the proper die it's probably through the proper die thing< thing and again reverse engineer what thing and again reverse engineer what are< are the food that they eat how much they are the food that they eat how much they eat< eat why they eat much then you know just eat why they eat much then you know just reverse< reverse engineer and I guess you know it reverse engineer and I guess you know it takes< takes work definitely so reverse takes work definitely so reverse engineering< engineering concept is not difficult but engineering concept is not difficult but doing< doing the work again that one I think doing the work again that one I think most< most people would have problem executing most people would have problem executing on< on it because they just want things on it because they just want things delivered< delivered easy but I mean nothing in delivered easy but I mean nothing in life< life is it's easy especially if it's you life is it's easy especially if it's you know< know if the reward if there's rewards at know if the reward if there's rewards at the< the end of it you got to put in effort the end of it you got to put in effort for< for it yeah that's right so it's pretty for it yeah that's right so it's pretty much< much like they're saying success lives much like they're saying success lives clu< clu right so instead of trying to clu right so instead of trying to reinvent< reinvent the wheel on your own you know reinvent the wheel on your own you know see< see somebody that you know you want to see somebody that you know you want to have< have the kind of results that they're have the kind of results that they're having< having just you know model after them having just you know model after them not< not need to copy but see what they're not need to copy but see what they're doing< doing that actually leads to the kind of doing that actually leads to the kind of results< results that you want and I kind of just results that you want and I kind of just follow< follow that as well yeah I mean you just follow that as well yeah I mean you just said< said it exactly in fact just to share said it exactly in fact just to share with< with you the entire my entire systematic with you the entire my entire systematic soal< soal trading strategy the entire soal trading strategy the entire portfolio< portfolio is actually taken or learned portfolio is actually taken or learned from< from other Traders before me I just from other Traders before me I just pretty< pretty much know buy off their books pretty much know buy off their books they< they share their rules in the in the they share their rules in the in the books< books right I pull out the concepts the books right I pull out the concepts the ideas< ideas and I just pass it to a program ideas and I just pass it to a program hey< hey let's test this idea see how it hey let's test this idea see how it works< works and if it's okay let's you know works and if it's okay let's you know refine< refine and took it from there I didn't refine and took it from there I didn't invent< invent anything I mean I just simply invent anything I mean I just simply learn< learn from people who are better than me learn from people who are better than me and< and try to make it my own that's all I and try to make it my own that's all I did< did yeah so finally if people want to did yeah so finally if people want to know< know more about you you know other than know more about you you know other than going< going to your YouTube

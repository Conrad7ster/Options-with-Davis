Language: en all< all right all right all righty so in all right all right all righty so in today's< today's video if you notice I had an today's video if you notice I had an additional< additional all right in my introduction additional all right in my introduction when< when there's normally just all right all when there's normally just all right all righty< righty so today's video I have three all righty so today's video I have three all right< right all right Al righty and the reason right all right Al righty and the reason is< is because in this video I'm going to be is because in this video I'm going to be sharing< sharing with you my top three index ETFs sharing with you my top three index ETFs option< option strategies for beginners so that option strategies for beginners so that is< is why there is the extra already is why there is the extra already because< because it's that good all right stop because it's that good all right stop this< this Davis if you have already left this this Davis if you have already left this video< video I don't blame you but if you are video I don't blame you but if you are still< still here and you're interested to find still here and you're interested to find out< out more about what I have to say then I out more about what I have to say then I appreciate< appreciate you I appreciate you all appreciate you I appreciate you all right< right let's get down to business so the right let's get down to business so the very< very first strategy for the index ETFs very first strategy for the index ETFs that< that I think is very suitable for that I think is very suitable for beginners< beginners to use as well and that is beginners to use as well and that is none< none other than the ever popular bullo none other than the ever popular bullo spread< spread so if you're not familiar with spread so if you're not familiar with what< what the bullo spread is if you're new what the bullo spread is if you're new to< to trading options then the buut spread to trading options then the buut spread is< is basically a bullish strategy that is basically a bullish strategy that consists< consists of two single options right you consists of two single options right you have< have the shut and then you have the long have the shut and then you have the long putut< putut so the buut spread is also known putut so the buut spread is also known as< as the put credit spread so if you were as the put credit spread so if you were to< to take a look at the chart down here to take a look at the chart down here basically< basically the buut spread consists of basically the buut spread consists of you< you selling one put option this is where you selling one put option this is where you're< you're going to get some premium all you're going to get some premium all right< right so going to put $2 signs down here right so going to put $2 signs down here to< to show you that you're are receiving a to show you that you're are receiving a credit< credit by selling this and when you buy credit by selling this and when you buy this< this back what happens is that you're this back what happens is that you're actually< actually going to pay some money to buy actually going to pay some money to buy this< this and the reason we want to buy this this and the reason we want to buy this put< put option down here is because it put option down here is because it serves< serves as a protection in a sense serves as a protection in a sense whereby< whereby if the market really crashes all whereby if the market really crashes all the< the way down then guess what your loss the way down then guess what your loss is< is limited right it's kept to this point is limited right it's kept to this point down< down here so you cannot lose more than down here so you cannot lose more than what< what you have reached on this trade so what you have reached on this trade so let's< let's say for example touchwood in the let's say for example touchwood in the event< event whereby the index ETF really event whereby the index ETF really crashes< crashes all the way to zero you actually crashes all the way to zero you actually do< do not lose your hope whole account but do not lose your hope whole account but rather< rather just whatever you risk on the rather just whatever you risk on the trade< trade right so for example if you have trade right so for example if you have only< only rised $500 for the trade then the only rised $500 for the trade then the most< most you could lose is only $500 so for most you could lose is only $500 so for this< this spread itself you notice that this spread itself you notice that because< because you are selling a put option because you are selling a put option that< that is nearer to where the current that is nearer to where the current market< market price is so this is where the market price is so this is where the current< current market price is because you're current market price is because you're selling< selling the put that is closer to where selling the put that is closer to where the< the current market price is you're going the current market price is you're going to< to get more premium than when you buy to get more premium than when you buy this< this put option because this put option this put option because this put option that< that you buy is going to be further out that you buy is going to be further out of< of the money so you're going to pay of the money so you're going to pay slightly< slightly lesser than the credit which slightly lesser than the credit which you< you receive so overall the net should be you receive so overall the net should be a< a positive credit right so you'll be a positive credit right so you'll be receiving< receiving credit and in options world we receiving credit and in options world we call< call it premium so we receive a premium call it premium so we receive a premium for< for selling this bull put spread now why for selling this bull put spread now why trade< trade the bull put spread on index ETFs trade the bull put spread on index ETFs so< so the reason is because the index ETFs so the reason is because the index ETFs has< has a positive drift right so if you're has a positive drift right so if you're not< not familiar with what the term positive not familiar with what the term positive drift< drift means it means that the market drift means it means that the market just< just wants to go higher over the long just wants to go higher over the long term< term so so if you were to take a look at term so so if you were to take a look at the< the main index ETFs like for example the the main index ETFs like for example the spiders< spiders the iwm and the qqqs if you were spiders the iwm and the qqqs if you were to< to take a look at the prices back like to take a look at the prices back like what< what 10 20 years ago you notice that it what 10 20 years ago you notice that it is< is much much lower right and that is why is much much lower right and that is why it< it has a positive Dill because over time it has a positive Dill because over time the< the market generally wants to go higher the market generally wants to go higher so< so these are the broad-based index ETFs so these are the broad-based index ETFs that< that I'm talking about so by playing the that I'm talking about so by playing the trade< trade to the upside you generally will trade to the upside you generally will participate< participate in this positive drift as participate in this positive drift as well< well so that is why you want to go with well so that is why you want to go with the< the boob put spread because it is the boob put spread because it is generally< generally a positive strategy where you generally a positive strategy where you make< make money if the market goes higher so make money. if the market goes higher so if< if you were to take a look at this uh if you were to take a look at this uh chart< chart down here rather this graph over chart down here rather this graph over here< here now this is done by the tasty trade here now this is done by the tasty trade team< team so they have done quite a bit of team so they have done quite a bit of research< research into the put spread the bull research into the put spread the bull put< put spread so as you can see down here put spread so as you can see down here they< they have tested you know three they have tested you know three different< different spread width of the bull put different spread width of the bull put spread< spread right you have the $1 wide spread spread right you have the $1 wide spread $10< $10 wide spread and the $5 wide spread $10 wide spread and the $5 wide spread so< so what you will notice is that they all so what you will notice is that they all made< made money over time right and as you made money over time right and as you can< can see this studies stretched all the can see this studies stretched all the way< way back to sometime right 2006 around way back to sometime right 2006 around 2007< 2007 there so this is you know quite a 2007 there so this is you know quite a significant< significant study set because they have significant study set because they have studied< studied this for you know over a decade studied this for you know over a decade or< or so so that is not to say that or so so that is not to say that although< although you will be overall profitable although you will be overall profitable doesn't< doesn't mean that you will not lose doesn't mean that you will not lose money< money right so I want you to bring your money right so I want you to bring your attention< attention to this time frame down here attention to this time frame down here which< which is somewhere around 2008 which is which is somewhere around 2008 which is the< the great financial crisis so in 2008 the great financial crisis so in 2008 the< the market crashed so when the market the market crashed so when the market crash< crash is very hard to avoid a loss crash is very hard to avoid a loss because< because the bullo spread by itself is a because the bullo spread by itself is a bullish< bullish strategy so as you can see down bullish strategy so as you can see down here< here all the three spreads would have here all the three spreads would have lost< lost money right but of course they lost lost money right but of course they lost based< based on varying degrees depending on based on varying degrees depending on the< the width of the spread so generally you the width of the spread so generally you know< know if your spread width is a little know if your spread width is a little bit< bit tighter you're going to lose much bit tighter you're going to lose much more< more right as you can see this is the more right as you can see this is the green< green color one the depicted by the $1 green color one the depicted by the $1 wide< wide uh spread down here you can see wide uh spread down here you can see that< that it has the lowest point at this that it has the lowest point at this point< point in 2009 right and that is why you point in 2009 right and that is why you know< know I mentioned that I'm not a very big know I mentioned that I'm not a very big fan< fan of very tight spreads because it's fan of very tight spreads because it's much< much easier for you to hit your max loss much easier for you to hit your max loss so< so many people think that you know so many people think that you know having< having a smaller or rather a tighter having a smaller or rather a tighter spread< spread is going to be less riskier than spread is going to be less riskier than a< a wider spread now this is only true if a wider spread now this is only true if you< you just trade one contract but most of you just trade one contract but most of the< the time we have to put our Capital the time we have to put our Capital allocation< allocation into it right so let's say allocation into it right so let's say for< for example you've decided to risk say for example you've decided to risk say $1,000< $1,000 per trade if you're going to RIS $1,000 per trade if you're going to RIS $1,000< $1,000 per trade there will be maybe $1,000 per trade there will be maybe around< around 10 contracts of $1 wide one around 10 contracts of $1 wide one contract< contract of $10 wide two contracts of $5 contract of $10 wide two contracts of $5 wide< wide so in terms of the maximum risk wide so in terms of the maximum risk they< they are all the same but which is the they are all the same but which is the one< one that is going to hit the max loss one that is going to hit the max loss most< most often that is the $1 wide because most often that is the $1 wide because as< as you know it's so tight that it's much as you know it's so tight that it's much closer< closer to where the market is all right closer to where the market is all right so< so this is what you need to really so this is what you need to really understand< understand so in general when we put on understand so in general when we put on the< the bullpull spread you want to think of the bullpull spread you want to think of it< it over the long term right so as you it over the long term right so as you can< can see down here the stud is from can see down here the stud is from somewhere< somewhere 2006 they stretch forth to all somewhere 2006 they stretch forth to all the< the way to 2017 and even to probably the way to 2017 and even to probably 2018< 2018 and in the long term this is where 2018 and in the long term this is where your< your profit comes in so again remember your profit comes in so again remember when< when you're trading options you want to when you're trading options you want to think< think for the overall statistical Edge think for the overall statistical Edge in< in the market over the long term rather in the market over the long term rather just< just looking at the next few trades or just looking at the next few trades or so< so now when do you put on the bull put so now when do you put on the bull put spread< spread so I'm going to be sharing with spread so I'm going to be sharing with you< you two very simple ways that you can you two very simple ways that you can get< get into the buut spread now this is not get into the buut spread now this is not the< the N all or Beall way to get into you the N all or Beall way to get into you know< know the buut spread but this is just know the buut spread but this is just for< for you to get your feet wet just for for you to get your feet wet just for you< you to get started and a pretty simple you to get started and a pretty simple way< way as well so the very first way is to way as well so the very first way is to enter< enter into a buut spread when the market enter into a buut spread when the market is< is near a support area so what is a is near a support area so what is a support< support area a support area is where you support area a support area is where you can< can see on the chart that the prices has can see on the chart that the prices has bounced< bounced off you know certain price bounced off you know certain price levels< levels a few times so as you can see levels a few times so as you can see down< down here the price has bounced off down here the price has bounced off somewhere< somewhere around somewhere around 64. 5< 64.

5 right and you can see right now 64. 5 right and you can see right now this< this is currently where the market price this is currently where the market price is< is at least of this recording so this is is at least of this recording so this is considered< considered where the support is so this considered where the support is so this is< is where you can consider putting on a is where you can consider putting on a bull< bull put spread where you put the short bull put spread where you put the short put< put below this support area right down put below this support area right down here< here and then you can just buy your uh here and then you can just buy your uh long< long put further away by the way you do long put further away by the way you do this< this as a spread that means you do this this as a spread that means you do this in< in one single order ticket rather than in one single order ticket rather than spread< spread them up right so if you enter spread them up right so if you enter into< into a buut spread you do not want to into a buut spread you do not want to separate< separate leg in right that means you do separate leg in right that means you do not< not want to sell the put first and then not want to sell the put first and then later< later buy the long put right rather you later buy the long put right rather you you< you want to enter them as a spread enter you want to enter them as a spread enter it< it together this way there is no legging it together this way there is no legging risk< risk all right so this is the first way risk all right so this is the first way now< now the second way is to use an now the second way is to use an indicator< indicator right called the either the indicator right called the either the stochastics< stochastics or the RSI so these two stochastics or the RSI so these two indicators< indicators they indicate to you whether indicators they indicate to you whether the< the market condition is either the market condition is either overbought< overbought or overso so as you can see overbought or overso so as you can see down< down here this is the stochastic so what down here this is the stochastic so what you< you want to look out for is when the you want to look out for is when the stochastics< stochastics or the RSI goes below this stochastics or the RSI goes below this line< line down here at the bottom right this line down here at the bottom right this line< line down here this is where indicates line down here this is where indicates that< that the market is oversold and this is that the market is oversold and this is where< where you can consider putting on the where you can consider putting on the bull< bull spread now one thing for you to bull spread now one thing for you to understand< understand and I mentioned this in quite understand and I mentioned this in quite a< a number of my videos as well when I a number of my videos as well when I talk< talk about the stochastic is that the talk about the stochastic is that the stochastics< stochastics is not a Wonder indicator stochastics is not a Wonder indicator whereby< whereby every time it's oversold the whereby every time it's oversold the market< market is going to go up right as you market is going to go up right as you know< know Market is very Dynamic that means know Market is very Dynamic that means to< to say that if the market is oversold it to say that if the market is oversold it can< can still continue to be oversold but can still continue to be oversold but what< what we're doing down here is just put what we're doing down here is just put the< the odds in our favor because if the the odds in our favor because if the market< market is over but so then it just means market is over but so then it just means the< the chances of it going further down is the chances of it going further down is not< not as high as it going up right so not as high as it going up right so definitely< definitely there'll be times where you definitely there'll be times where you put< put on the trade and then the market put on the trade and then the market still< still continues to go down that is all still continues to go down that is all part< part and parcel of trading again you part and parcel of trading again you cannot< cannot win every single trade you will cannot win every single trade you will still< still have losers but this is just a way still have losers but this is just a way for< for you to at least identify you know for you to at least identify you know what< what is the underlying Market condition what is the underlying Market condition because< because it's much better than if you because it's much better than if you were< were to enter a boo spread when the were to enter a boo spread when the market< market is overboard when the market is market is overboard when the market is overboard< overboard usually is when the market has overboard usually is when the market has gone< gone up quite a bit gone up quite a bit that< that is not a smart time for you to that is not a. smart time for you to actually< actually put on a bull put spread right actually put on a bull put spread right so< so again when we put on any trades we so again when we put on any trades we want< want to try to get as you know many of want to try to get as you know many of the< the odds in our favor before we enter the odds in our favor before we enter into< into a trade so that's why you know if into a trade so that's why you know if you< you were to use the stochastic RSI you you were to use the stochastic RSI you can< can use this as an indication when the can use this as an indication when the market< market is overs so to put on the bull market is overs so to put on the bull put< put spread now the third way to enter put spread now the third way to enter into< into the market is a combination of both into the market is a combination of both right< right so when you see that the market is right so when you see that the market is oversold< oversold and at the same time it's near oversold and at the same time it's near the< the support area then you can enter into the support area then you can enter into a< a bull put spread so this is what you a bull put spread so this is what you call< call a Confluence of different call a Confluence of different indicators< indicators so to speak because you have indicators so to speak because you have a< a support level telling you you know the a support level telling you you know the market< market is likely to bounce back up you market is likely to bounce back up you also< also have the indicator that tells you also have the indicator that tells you it's< it's oversold so again likelier for the it's oversold so again likelier for the market< market to go up but again I stress that market to go up but again I stress that doesn't< doesn't mean that the market won't go doesn't mean that the market won't go further< further down right again everything is further down right again everything is based< based on probability but as long as you based on probability but as long as you continue< continue to do this over time there continue to do this over time there should< should be an edge for you that plays out should be an edge for you that plays out all< all right so this is the very first all right so this is the very first strategy< strategy that is the bput spread now strategy that is the bput spread now let's< let's get into the second strategy and let's get into the second strategy and that< that is the iron Condor so for those of that is the iron Condor so for those of you< you who are new to trading options the you who are new to trading options the iron< iron condol is a neutral strategy that iron condol is a neutral strategy that consists< consists of two credit spreads right so consists of two credit spreads right so the< the very first credit spread is the bull the very first credit spread is the bull put< put spread so this is what we have just put spread so this is what we have just talked< talked about and then you have the bare talked about and then you have the bare call< call spread so the bare call spread is call spread so the bare call spread is the< the counterpart right so the counterpart the counterpart right so the counterpart is< is the call spread at the top of where is the call spread at the top of where the< the market would be because the call the market would be because the call spread< spread is a bearish strategy that means spread is a bearish strategy that means we< we want the market to go down and the we want the market to go down and the bullish< bullish strategy is the blut spread and bullish strategy is the blut spread and we< we want the market go up so the ion we want the market go up so the ion Condor< Condor combines this two strategy Condor combines this two strategy whereby< whereby you aim to profit if the market whereby you aim to profit if the market stays< stays Within These two zone so this is stays Within These two zone so this is the< the iron Condor strategy now why do we the iron Condor strategy now why do we want< want to use the iron Condor on index want to use the iron Condor on index ETFs< ETFs by the way if you like this video ETFs by the way if you like this video so< so far Please

com blueprint all right back with davis. com blueprint all right back to< to the video well that is because the to the video well that is because the iron< iron Condor is a strategy that aims to iron Condor is a strategy that aims to capture< capture profits if the market stays capture profits if the market stays within< within the expected move so the expected within the expected move so the expected move< move is a very important term for you to move is a very important term for you to understand< understand especially if you want to understand especially if you want to trade< trade options for the long term so I've trade options for the long term so I've mentioned< mentioned this in quite a number of mentioned this in quite a number of videos< videos uh if you're not very familiar videos uh if you're not very familiar with< with the expected move uh there is a with the expected move uh there is a video< video I've already created called the video I've already created called the number< number one secret to becoming number one secret to becoming consistently< consistently profitable in trading consistently profitable in trading options< options I'll put the link at the top options I'll put the link at the top right< right hand corner of this video so you right hand corner of this video so you can< can go ahead to watch that if you're not can go ahead to watch that if you're not sure< sure but basically the expected move sure but basically the expected move just< just basically depicts where the market just basically depicts where the market would< would likely be in a given range over would likely be in a given range over the< the next number of days right depending the next number of days right depending on< on the volatility and the reason why the on the volatility and the reason why the I< I condra is good is because most of the I condra is good is because most of the time< time the realiz move that means the time the realiz move that means the actual< actual move of the underlying Market is actual move of the underlying Market is lesser< lesser than the expected move which lesser than the expected move which means< means to say in layman terms most of the means to say in layman terms most of the time< time the market would stay inside the time the market would stay inside the expected< expected range move which is the range expected range move which is the range which< which we want right so let's say if I which we want right so let's say if I bring< bring it back to this uh chart down here bring it back to this uh chart down here let's< let's assume that what we're putting on let's assume that what we're putting on down< down here is the expected move so this down here is the expected move so this is< is the expected move and the realized is the expected move and the realized move< move is basically inside of this move so move is basically inside of this move so most< most of the time if the market stays most of the time if the market stays inside< inside here this is where you will make inside here this is where you will make money< money on the iron Condor so extend I money on the iron Condor so extend I Studies< Studies have already shown that the Studies have already shown that the realized< realized move of the index ETF is often realized move of the index ETF is often lesser< lesser than the expected move so this is lesser than the expected move so this is the< the whole reason why the I Condor can the whole reason why the I Condor can actually< actually be profitable in the first actually be profitable in the first place< place so making this a profitable place so making this a profitable strategy< strategy in the long term but don't take strategy in the long term but don't take it< it from me right rather take a look at it from me right rather take a look at the< the studies right see all the studies the studies right see all the studies being< being done I'm a very big fan big being done I'm a very big fan big advocate< advocate of seeing studies I generally advocate of seeing studies I generally won't< won't put my money into something until won't put my money into something until I< I actually see the studies to see that I actually see the studies to see that we< we actually have some Edge in the market we actually have some Edge in the market for< for trading the strategy so as you can for trading the strategy so as you can see< see down here this is off the spy and see down here this is off the spy and again< again this is a very significant study again this is a very significant study set< set I think it's done over a number of set I think it's done over a number of uh< uh decades maybe one or two decades and uh decades maybe one or two decades and you< you can see down here right this is the you can see down here right this is the average< average realized move this is the average realized move this is the average< average expected move and as you can see average expected move and as you can see the< the realized move is lesser than the the realized move is lesser than the expected< expected move right you can see also expected move right you can see also they< they break down depending on the they break down depending on the different< different volatility so it doesn't different volatility so it doesn't matter< matter if the market is highly volatile matter if the market is highly volatile or< or it's in a very low volatility or it's in a very low volatility environment< environment you can see that in all environment you can see that in all instances< instances the realized move is lesser instances the realized move is lesser than< than the expected move which means to than the expected move which means to say< say we are going to profit on the iron say we are going to profit on the iron Condor< Condor most of the time now does this Condor most of the time now does this mean< mean that every single trade is going to mean that every single trade is going to be< be a winner definitely not right because be a winner definitely not right because you< you notice the keyword down here is you notice the keyword down here is average< average right average just means that average right average just means that there< there are times where you know the there are times where you know the expected< expected move is going to be lesser than expected move is going to be lesser than the< the realized move and there'll be times the realized move and there'll be times where< where is more than the expected move but where is more than the expected move but in< in the overall terms in terms of the in the overall terms in terms of the average< average realized move is still lesser average realized move is still lesser than< than the expected move and that is where than the expected move and that is where the< the edge lies in terms of iron Condor the edge lies in terms of iron Condor now< now when do you want to put on the iron now when do you want to put on the iron Condor< Condor so there are two ways that you Condor so there are two ways that you can< can put on the iron Condor the very can put on the iron Condor the very first< first way is using what you see on the first way is using what you see on the charts< charts right so basically you wait till charts right so basically you wait till the< the market goes within a previous high the market goes within a previous high and< and low then you place the strikes and low then you place the strikes outside< outside of the high and low so this is outside of the high and low so this is just< just an example by the way on the chart just an example by the way on the chart so< so as you can see down here this is uh so as you can see down here this is uh the< the price has gone down quite a bit to the price has gone down quite a bit to somewhere< somewhere within the previous high and somewhere within the previous high and low< low so you can see this is the previous low so you can see this is the previous high< high this is the previous low so right high this is the previous low so right now< now it's somewhere within the high and now it's somewhere within the high and low< low so this is where we can place the low so this is where we can place the iron< iron Condor strikes the short strikes iron Condor strikes the short strikes beyond< beyond the highs and lows right because beyond the highs and lows right because the< the highs and lows can serve as you know the highs and lows can serve as you know support< support and resistance levels as well so support and resistance levels as well so for< for example if the market goes down here for example if the market goes down here this< this can then possibly bring it up you this can then possibly bring it up you know< know bounce it back up and let's say for know bounce it back up and let's say for example< example if the market goes up then it example if the market goes up then it could< could possibly come back down because could possibly come back down because there< there is you know a pre previous High there is you know a pre previous High which< which could serve as a resistance right which could serve as a resistance right so< so that is why you know when you place so that is why you know when you place your< your strikes outside of these highs and your strikes outside of these highs and lows< lows it gives you a higher chance of the lows it gives you a higher chance of the market< market actually staying within this market actually staying within this range< range so this is the first way so the range so this is the first way so the second< second way is just to continuously put second way is just to continuously put it< it on over time and let the statistical it on over time and let the statistical Edge< Edge play out right so as you can see Edge play out right so as you can see down< down here this is a study again done by down here this is a study again done by the< the tasty trade team they put on a 20 the tasty trade team they put on a 20 Delta< Delta $10 wide iron Condor and they Delta $10 wide iron Condor and they tested< tested two different exit tactics right tested two different exit tactics right the< the first exit tactic is to exit once the first exit tactic is to exit once the< the whole iron Condor expires and the the whole iron Condor expires and the second< second one is the exit when there's 21 second one is the exit when there's 21 days< days left to exploration what that means days left to exploration what that means is< is that let's say you put on the iron is that let's say you put on the iron Condor< Condor at roughly 45 DTE now when this Condor at roughly 45 DTE now when this 45< 45 DTE goes down to 21 DTE you exit the 45 DTE goes down to 21 DTE you exit the trade< trade so as you can see both are trade so as you can see both are actually< actually profitable you were to look at actually profitable you were to look at the< the scale on the left hand side it tells the scale on the left hand side it tells you< you how much money you make you know you how much money you make you know based< based on one contract so the way they based on one contract so the way they tested< tested this is is just by putting on one tested this is is just by putting on one contract< contract and then they exit either at 21 contract and then they exit either at 21 DTE< DTE and then put on a new iron condol or DTE and then put on a new iron condol or they< they just leave it to expire and then they just leave it to expire and then they< they put on the new one so as you can they put on the new one so as you can see< see they just continuously put it on and see they just continuously put it on and the< the whole idea here is to capture the the whole idea here is to capture the fact< fact that the expected move is fact that the expected move is overstated< overstated compared to the realized move overstated compared to the realized move right< right so this is where the edge is they right so this is where the edge is they just< just want to play The Edge out and as just want to play The Edge out and as you< you can see over the long term you're you can see over the long term you're going< going to be profitable now are you going going to be profitable now are you going to< to be profitable all the time definitely to be profitable all the time definitely not< not right so as you can see there will not right so as you can see there will be< be times where you do lose money be times where you do lose money there'll< there'll be losing streaks of course as there'll be losing streaks of course as well< well because probability depicts that well because probability depicts that you< you can have losing streaks but over the you can have losing streaks but over the long< long term it should play out now one is long term it should play out now one is better< better than the other so you can see the better than the other so you can see the one< one at 21 DTE has a much Superior one at 21 DTE has a much Superior performance< performance than holding to expiration performance than holding to expiration which< which is the reason why I. don't really which is the reason why I don't really suggest< suggest you hold your Ion Condor to suggest you hold your Ion Condor to expiration< expiration because you also have expiration because you also have assignment< assignment risk because if your Ion cond assignment risk because if your Ion cond goes< goes in money either the call side or goes in money either the call side or the< the put side then good luck to you right the put side then good luck to you right because< because you're going to be assigned because you're going to be assigned shares< shares either you're going to be long shares either you're going to be long the< the underlying shares or short the the underlying shares or short the underlying< underlying shares and the worst case is underlying shares and the worst case is that< that if you do get assign you may get a that if you do get assign you may get a margin< margin call if you don't have enough margin call if you don't have enough funds< funds and that's going to be very messy funds and that's going to be very messy right< right so the best way is just get out at right so the best way is just get out at 21< 21 DTE you get much Superior performance 21 DTE you get much Superior performance as< as well so that is the iron Condor now as well so that is the iron Condor now the< the third and final strategy which the third and final strategy which really< really warranted my last already in my really warranted my last already in my introduction< introduction is the Jade iron Condor so introduction is the Jade iron Condor so the< the Jade in condo is a name that I coed the Jade in condo is a name that I coed myself< myself thank you very much and it's myself thank you very much and it's really< really thanks to the people at tasty really thanks to the people at tasty trade< trade because they came up with the trade because they came up with the strategy< strategy called the Jade lizard but strategy called the Jade lizard but basically< basically Jade lizard is this same basically Jade lizard is this same structure< structure but without this long put down structure but without this long put down here< here so the Jade lizard is an undefined here so the Jade lizard is an undefined RIS< RIS strategy whereas the Jade iron RIS strategy whereas the Jade iron Condor< Condor is just the defined RIS version Condor is just the defined RIS version so< so I just basically named the word you so I just basically named the word you know< know Jade iron Condor after the know Jade iron Condor after the undefined< undefined risk version which is the Jade undefined risk version which is the Jade lizard< lizard okay so what is the Jade iron lizard okay so what is the Jade iron Condor< Condor so the Jade iron Condor is a Condor so the Jade iron Condor is a neutral< neutral to Pish strategy that is neutral to Pish strategy that is constructed< constructed in a way that you do not constructed in a way that you do not have< have any risk to the upside so if you have any risk to the upside so if you notice< notice the construct of this Jade iron notice the construct of this Jade iron Condor< Condor is similar to an iron Condor Condor is similar to an iron Condor right< right where you have a p spread and a right where you have a p spread and a call< call spread but the difference is that call spread but the difference is that for< for the bare call spread the call spread for the bare call spread the call spread side< side you notice it has a much smaller side you notice it has a much smaller width< width compared to the bull put spread width compared to the bull put spread and< and the reason the way we construct this and the reason the way we construct this is< is because we want no risk to the upside is because we want no risk to the upside whereby< whereby even if the market does shoot whereby even if the market does shoot all< all the way past your call spread this all the way past your call spread this is< is actually still a profit so how does is actually still a profit so how does this< this work right so I'm just going to this work right so I'm just going to very< very quickly just get into this so as we very quickly just get into this so as we already< already know the bare call spread the already know the bare call spread the max< max loss of what you lose on this bare max loss of what you lose on this bare call< call spread will be the width of the call spread will be the width of the spread< spread right so let's say for example if spread right so let's say for example if the< the width of the spread is $1 it means the width of the spread is $1 it means to< to say if you will lose on this whole B to say if you will lose on this whole B call< call spread you will lose $100 right call spread you will lose $100 right based< based on one be call spread now if you based on one be call spread now if you already< already know that the max loss will be already know that the max loss will be based< based on $1 we have to collect a total based on $1 we have to collect a total credit< credit for this whole spread the Jade credit for this whole spread the Jade Condor< Condor to be more than $1 so let's say Condor to be more than $1 so let's say for< for example you sell the bull put spread for example you sell the bull put spread and< and you receive a credit for let's say and you receive a credit for let's say a150< a150 and for the B call spread you sell a150 and for the B call spread you sell it< it and you receive a credit of let's say it and you receive a credit of let's say 50< 50 Cent so you receive a total credit 50 Cent so you receive a total credit down< down here of $2 so your total premium is down here of $2 so your total premium is $2< $2 for the J and condo now if the market $2 for the J and condo now if the market was< was to really shoot all the way up past was to really shoot all the way up past your< your call spread you will lose a dollar your call spread you will lose a dollar of< of this $2 wide which means to say you of this $2 wide which means to say you still< still leave a remainder of a positive $1 still leave a remainder of a positive $1 so< so I hope you kind of understand this so so I hope you kind of understand this so if< if you're not too sure again I've if you're not too sure again I've already< already created a video an in-depth already created a video an in-depth video< video on the J iron Condor on my channel video on the J iron Condor on my channel as< as well just go ahead to search for the as well just go ahead to search for the Jade< Jade iron Condor and I break it down Jade iron Condor and I break it down even< even deeper all right so this is just an even deeper all right so this is just an introduction< introduction to the Jade iron Condor now introduction to the Jade iron Condor now why< why the Jade iron Condor on the index why the Jade iron Condor on the index ETFs< ETFs so the reason is very similar to ETFs so the reason is very similar to the< the buut spread right like the bull put the buut spread right like the bull put spread< spread it also takes advantage of the spread it also takes advantage of the positive< positive drift on the index ETF but it positive drift on the index ETF but it also< also at the same time provide some hedge also at the same time provide some hedge to< to the downside right it have the Hedge to the downside right it have the Hedge to< to the downside mainly because of this to the downside mainly because of this call< call spread down here because you're call spread down here because you're still< still collecting some credit on this still collecting some credit on this call< call spread and at the same time it also call spread and at the same time it also captures< captures profit if the market stays captures profit if the market stays within< within the expected move so in this case within the expected move so in this case let's< let's say it does stay within the two let's say it does stay within the two short< short strikes you will stand to make short strikes you will stand to make your< your max profit here and if the market your max profit here and if the market Ries< Ries past the call spread unlike the Ries past the call spread unlike the iron< iron Condor right it's still in a profit iron Condor right it's still in a profit so< so that's why you know the Jade iron so that's why you know the Jade iron Condor< Condor is pretty versatile right it Condor is pretty versatile right it combines< combines The Best of Both Worlds the combines The Best of Both Worlds the bull< bull put spread and the iron Condor and bull put spread and the iron Condor and that< that is the reason why the J iron Condor that is the reason why the J iron Condor is< is actually a pretty good strategy for is actually a pretty good strategy for the< the index ETFs and if you really think the index ETFs and if you really think about< about it the way this Jade iron Condor about it the way this Jade iron Condor is< is you can think of it as it is a put is you can think of it as it is a put spread< spread but you just add some protection spread but you just add some protection in< in terms of a very small call spread so in terms of a very small call spread so this< this way if the market does go down this way if the market does go down right< right your draw down is not going to be right your draw down is not going to be as< as much as if you just put on a bullo as much as if you just put on a bullo spread< spread without this call spread right spread without this call spread right because< because you're going to take the whole because you're going to take the whole heat< heat of the move down but because you're heat of the move down but because you're going< going to have this uh call spread down going to have this uh call spread down here< here so let me just remove this thing here so let me just remove this thing yep< yep so if you were to have this call yep so if you were to have this call spread< spread down here as the market goes down spread down here as the market goes down this< this call spread will take some profit this call spread will take some profit okay< okay so this is the Jade iron condra now okay so this is the Jade iron condra now when< when do you put on the Jade iron Condor when do you put on the Jade iron Condor so< so for the Jade iron Condor unlike the so for the Jade iron Condor unlike the bull< bull put spread you don't have to wait bull put spread you don't have to wait till< till the market is near a support level till the market is near a support level or< or the stochastic RSI is oversold or the stochastic RSI is oversold although< although you can but then for the most although you can but then for the most part< part right you can put on the jadeon part right you can put on the jadeon Condor< Condor with not as a strict criteria Condor with not as a strict criteria compared< compared to the buut spread right compared to the buut spread right because< because for the buut spread you really because for the buut spread you really do< do want to be very bullish on the do want to be very bullish on the underlying< underlying first you want to be very underlying first you want to be very bullish< bullish on the index ETF first before bullish on the index ETF first before you< you actually put it on but for the jit you actually put it on but for the jit iron< iron Condor you can be somewhere neutral iron Condor you can be somewhere neutral to< to bullish so which means to say once to bullish so which means to say once the< the market you know make some sort of the market you know make some sort of retracement< retracement you can actually just choose retracement you can actually just choose to< to put on the jadeon condo all right to put on the jadeon condo

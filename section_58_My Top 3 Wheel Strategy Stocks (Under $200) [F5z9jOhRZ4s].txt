=============================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you the top I'm going to be sharing with you the top three< three stocks for the wheel strategy so three stocks for the wheel strategy so these< these three stocks are all under $200 so these three stocks are all under $200 so if< if you don't have that big of account if you don't have that big of account you< you can definitely will the stocks as you can definitely will the stocks as well< well now before I actually get into the well now before I actually get into the stocks< stocks I want to First share with you stocks I want to First share with you the< the four golden rules for how I select the four golden rules for how I select the< the wheel strategy stocks right so these the wheel strategy stocks right so these are< are the criteria so generally when I are the criteria so generally when I choose< choose stocks for the wheel strategy I choose stocks for the wheel strategy I want< want to choose stocks where at least I want to choose stocks where at least I think< think that there's a higher probability think that there's a higher probability of< of it going up once I enter into the of it going up once I enter into the stock< stock rather than you know be held in stock rather than you know be held in this< this underlying and be trapped there for this underlying and be trapped there for years< years and years on end right so there years and years on end right so there are< are four golden rules and the very first are four golden rules and the very first rule< rule is that the company has to be rule is that the company has to be profitable< profitable right so for me this is a profitable right so for me this is a very< very important one because when the very important one because when the company< company is profitable then at least the company is profitable then at least the chances< chances of it going bankrupt is not that chances of it going bankrupt is not that high< high right because there are companies high right because there are companies that< that people have traded the wheel that people have traded the wheel strategy< strategy on and then it just went strategy on and then it just went straight< straight to zero right because the straight to zero right because the company< company is not even making money they're company is not even making money they're trading< trading it mainly because it's very high trading it mainly because it's very high volatility< volatility so I like to take a different volatility so I like to take a different approach< approach because if you were to get into approach because if you were to get into the< the wheel strategy it's going to be the wheel strategy it's going to be pretty< pretty Capital intensive right because pretty Capital intensive right because the< the whole idea here is for you to the whole idea here is for you to actually< actually get into the stock position actually get into the stock position right< right if you're going to get a sign then right if you're going to get a sign then there's< there's going to be a hefty Capital there's going to be a hefty Capital intensive< intensive uh investment so I want to intensive uh investment so I want to make< make sure that if the company is make sure that if the company is profitable< profitable at least there's a chance profitable at least there's a chance that< that the company can Ste over time the that the company can Ste over time the stock< stock price will go up now that's rule stock price will go up now that's rule number< number one now rule number two the number one now rule number two the company< company has to generally have increasing company has to generally have increasing revenue< revenue and profits over the past few revenue and profits over the past few years< years so what I found is that when a years so what I found is that when a company< company generally has increasing revenue company generally has increasing revenue and< and profits over the past few years that and profits over the past few years that also< also kind of reflex in the stock price also kind of reflex in the stock price as< as well because remember every single as well because remember every single stock< stock that we are trading is actually a stock that we are trading is actually a company< company right so if it's a company that company right so if it's a company that is< is doing well it has been making money is doing well it has been making money generally< generally that also reflects in its generally that also reflects in its share< share price as well and what you find is share price as well and what you find is that< that if you find a company that do not that if you find a company that do not actually< actually. have increasing Revenue profits actually have increasing Revenue profits in< in fact they have increasing losses over in fact they have increasing losses over the< the years you will also find that their the years you will also find that their share< share price is very erratic right up and share price is very erratic right up and down< down right one of those stocks are like down right one of those stocks are like AMC< AMC so those are stocks I generally stay AMC so those are stocks I generally stay away< away from now rule number three so this away from now rule number three so this is< is to make sure that I have a margin of is to make sure that I have a margin of safety< safety and that is to see that the stock safety and that is to see that the stock is< is at least under value at that point in is at least under value at that point in time< time when I want to enter for the wheel time when I want to enter for the wheel strategy< strategy so you might get into a strategy so you might get into a underlying< underlying where the company is underlying where the company is profitable< profitable and that is increasing profitable and that is increasing revenue< revenue and profits over the past few revenue and profits over the past few years< years but it might be overvalue so if years but it might be overvalue so if the< the stock is overvalued then there is a the stock is overvalued then there is a chance< chance whereby once you enter into the chance whereby once you enter into the wheel< wheel strategy the stock might suddenly wheel strategy the stock might suddenly just< just plunge right go back down to its just plunge right go back down to its value< value and then uh you might be stuck in value and then uh you might be stuck in that< that position for quite some time so that position for quite some time so definitely< definitely I want to look out for one definitely I want to look out for one right< right at least to air on the safe side right at least to air on the safe side to< to find an underly a stock that is under to find an underly a stock that is under value< value and I'm going to share with you value and I'm going to share with you later< later on how to find out whether it's later on how to find out whether it's undervalued< undervalued or not and finally rule undervalued or not and finally rule number< number four is strong technicals so number four is strong technicals so basically< basically strong technicals is you take basically strong technicals is you take a< a look at the chart right the company a look at the chart right the company has< has to be around for quite a number of has to be around for quite a number of years< years and have gone through a number of years and have gone through a number of Market< Market crashes right basically the major Market crashes right basically the major crashes< crashes and it has survived the market crashes and it has survived the market crashes< crashes and each time it has come out of crashes and each time it has come out of it< it making new highs right so for me this it making new highs right so for me this is< is also important to know the durability is also important to know the durability or< or how strong this company is during or how strong this company is during Market< Market crisis okay so this are the four Market crisis okay so this are the four rules< rules okay so now let's get into the rules okay so now let's get into the stocks< stocks so the very first stock is none stocks so the very first stock is none other< other than alphabet right so alphabet other than alphabet right so alphabet the< the ticket symbol is Google right g g is the ticket symbol is Google right g g is the< the class A shares you can also go for the class A shares you can also go for the< the class B shares there's g g so at the class B shares there's g g so at this< this point in time uh Google right now this point in time uh Google right now or< or alphabet is at 165 $5 thereabouts or alphabet is at 165 $5 thereabouts right< right at least as of this recording now right at least as of this recording now let< let us see whether alphabet actually let us see whether alphabet actually meets< meets the four golden rules which we meets the four golden rules which we have< have defined just now so rule number one have defined just now so rule number one company< company has to be profitable and as you company has to be profitable and as you can< can see over here Google is profitable can see over here Google is profitable or< or rather alphabet right as you can see or rather alphabet right as you can see the< the net income is 73. 8 billion and the the net income is 73.

8 billion and the net< net profit margin is net profit margin is 24. 01< 24.

01 and this has increased from the 24. 01 and this has increased from the previous< previous year so alphabet definitely has previous year so alphabet definitely has met< met room rule number one now what about met room rule number one now what about rule< rule number two so rule number two is rule number two so rule number two is that< that the company generally has to have that the company generally has to have increasing< increasing revenue and profits over the increasing revenue and profits over the past< past few years and as you can see since past few years and as you can see since 2019< 2019 uh Google has had increasing 2019 uh Google has had increasing revenue< revenue and as for the net income revenue and as for the net income generally< generally has been increasing over time generally has been increasing over time as< as well now of course there's an anomaly as well now of course there's an anomaly at< at 2021 uh most likely is because due to at 2021 uh most likely is because due to the< the fact whereby you know after the the fact whereby you know after the pandemic< pandemic a lot of businesses start to pandemic a lot of businesses start to you< you know shift their uh marketing more you know shift their uh marketing more towards< towards digital side and they start to towards digital side and they start to use< use more of uh Google services as you use more of uh Google services as you know< know a lot of their business comes from know a lot of their business comes from the< the ad revenue and also a lot of people the ad revenue and also a lot of people start< start to you know watch a lot of online start to you know watch a lot of online videos< videos right most particularly during videos right most particularly during the< the pandemic time right everybody stuck the pandemic time right everybody stuck at< at home and then they're just watching at home and then they're just watching YouTube< YouTube and as you can see as a business YouTube and as you can see as a business this< this company alphabet is doing very well this company alphabet is doing very well so< so definitely it has satisfied rule so definitely it has satisfied rule number< number two now rule number three under number two now rule number three under value< value so as you can see over here this value so as you can see over here this is< is uh the website of Simply Wall Street is uh the website of Simply Wall Street so< so there are quite a number of websites so there are quite a number of websites that< that you can go to that actually you that you can go to that actually you know< know shares what they think is the fair know shares what they think is the fair value< value of the stock so you definitely value of the stock so you definitely want< want to go to you know a few of this want to go to you know a few of this take< take a look at them and then just have take a look at them and then just have an< an aggregate of all of them and you an aggregate of all of them and you could< could even discount some of the values could even discount some of the values that< that they give right just to give you an that they give right just to give you an even< even more margin of safety so as you can even more margin of safety so as you can see< see over here based on simply Wall see over here based on simply Wall Street< Street the fair value of Google or Street the fair value of Google or rather< rather alphabet is $253 $3 and as of rather alphabet is $253 $3 and as of this< this current price of 165 it is this current price of 165 it is currently< currently under value right so at least currently under value right so at least we< we know that there is going to be some we know that there is going to be some chance< chance of the market going up at this chance of the market going up at this current< current price and as you can see over current price and as you can see over. here< here at the bottom it says that Google here at the bottom it says that Google is< is significantly below fair value right is significantly below fair value right you< you can see Google is trading below fair you can see Google is trading below fair value< value by more than 20% so when I see a value by more than 20% so when I see a company< company which has rule number one rule company which has rule number one rule number< number two and rule number three and it number two and rule number three and it is< is really undervalued then this is is really undervalued then this is actually< actually a very good candidate for us to actually a very good candidate for us to do< do the whe strategy and finally rule do the whe strategy and finally rule number< number four it must have strong number four it must have strong technicals< technicals so the company must have gone technicals so the company must have gone through< through Market crashes and has made new through Market crashes and has made new highs< highs each time so does Google satisfy highs each time so does Google satisfy this< this criteria absolutely right as you this criteria absolutely right as you can< can see over here Google went through can see over here Google went through the< the financial crisis in 2008 the market the financial crisis in 2008 the market actually< actually went down quite a bit but as actually went down quite a bit but as you< you can see based on a very broad you can see based on a very broad perspective< perspective right for the past 10 plus perspective right for the past 10 plus years< years you can see that this drop down years you can see that this drop down here< here doesn't even look like much right here doesn't even look like much right but< but at the point of time that was a but at the point of time that was a really< really big crash right but as you can really big crash right but as you can see< see Market has since recovered over time see Market has since recovered over time and< and has just made higher highs right and has just made higher highs right even< even in 2018 right 2018 uh thanks to even in 2018 right 2018 uh thanks to Donald< Donald Trump we have the uh trade war Donald Trump we have the uh trade war and< and then 2020 we have the pandemic and and then 2020 we have the pandemic and then< then in 2022 thanks to Mr ptin where he then in 2022 thanks to Mr ptin where he put< put in his troops into Ukraine and put in his troops into Ukraine and caused< caused the worldwide inflation which caused the worldwide inflation which caused< caused the markets to really uh come caused the markets to really uh come down< down right as you can see during all down right as you can see during all these< these Market crashes alphabet managed to these Market crashes alphabet managed to come< come back up on top and then make new come back up on top and then make new highs< highs again right so alphabet definitely highs again right so alphabet definitely fit< fit the criteria of having strong fit the criteria of having strong technicals< technicals so in my opinion alet is technicals so in my opinion alet is definitely< definitely a good stock to wield and I definitely a good stock to wield and I have< have been willing alphabet for quite have been willing alphabet for quite some< some time now and has been doing very some time now and has been doing very well< well for me now the second stock is well for me now the second stock is Amazon< Amazon right Amazon as of this current Amazon right Amazon as of this current recording< recording is about recording is about $186< $186 so does Amazon fulfill the four $186 so does Amazon fulfill the four golden< golden rules as well well let's take a golden rules as well well let's take a look< look so rule number one is the company look so rule number one is the company profitable< profitable well it is right as you can profitable well it is right as you can see< see over here net income 3.

43 billion see over here net income 3. 43 billion and< and net profit is and net profit is 5.

29< 5. 29 and as you can see over here there 5.

29 and as you can see over here there has< has been a very big jump in the uh has been a very big jump in the uh profits< profits right the net income and a net profits right the net income and a net profit< profit margin over profit margin over 1,000%< 1,000% now what about rule number two 1,000% now what about rule number two does< does Amazon have increasing revenue and does Amazon have increasing revenue and profits< profits over the past few years well so profits over the past few years well so as< as you can see over here based on the as you can see over here based on the revenue< revenue the blue bar it does. have revenue the blue bar it does have increasing< increasing Revenue but for the net increasing Revenue but for the net income< income you notice that it was increasing income you notice that it was increasing until< until one year 2022 there was actually a until one year 2022 there was actually a loss< loss and the loss is really because of loss and the loss is really because of an< an investment which they did into the an investment which they did into the electric< electric automaker rivan which you know electric automaker rivan which you know suffered< suffered you know a very big decline the suffered you know a very big decline the share< share price I think about 80 plus per. share price I think about 80 plus per.

so< so that was the only uh big reason why so that was the only uh big reason why there< there was this NE negative income down there was this NE negative income down there< there but after that in 2023 as you can there but after that in 2023 as you can see< see it recovered and it did pretty well see it recovered and it did pretty well so< so rule number three it has to be so rule number three it has to be undervalue< undervalue so is Amazon undervalued and undervalue so is Amazon undervalued and as<. as you can see over here it is as you can see over here it is significantly< significantly undervalue as well right significantly undervalue as well right according< according to Simply Wall Street as you according to Simply Wall Street as you can< can see over here the fair value is can see over here the fair value is $336< $336 and at the current price of $336 and at the current price of $186< $186 it is undervalue in fact according $186 it is undervalue in fact according to< to Simply Wall Street is to Simply Wall Street is 44. 6%< 44.

6% under value now if you want to 44. 6% under value now if you want to have< have a little bit more conservative have a little bit more conservative value< value you can definitely take 336 and value you can definitely take 336 and then< then you have a discounted value of that then you have a discounted value of that right< right maybe you discount it by 10% and right maybe you discount it by 10% and so< so on even though if you discount it so on even though if you discount it you're< you're still going to find that the you're still going to find that the current< current price is still under value so current price is still under value so rule< rule number three it has passed this rule number three it has passed this criteria< criteria now for rule number four does criteria now for rule number four does Amazon< Amazon have strong technicals well it Amazon have strong technicals well it clearly< clearly has and in fact Amazon has gone clearly has and in fact Amazon has gone through< through the most difficult period for through the most difficult period for any< any tech company and that is 2000 right any tech company and that is 2000 right the< the year 2000 that was where the tech the year 2000 that was where the tech stock< stock crashed there was this internet stock crashed there was this internet bubble< bubble where a lot of company actually bubble where a lot of company. actually went< went bankrupt right a lot of company no went bankrupt right a lot of company no longer< longer are listed and Google didn't longer are listed and Google didn't actually< actually uh went through that time actually uh went through that time because< because it was only listed sometime in because it was only listed sometime in 2004< 2004 or 2005 but Amazon was listed 2004 or 2005 but Amazon was listed before< before the Doom bubble right so it went before the Doom bubble right so it went through< through the Doom bubble as a young through the Doom bubble as a young company< company it survived that and in the end company it survived that and in the end it< it went even higher in terms of the it went even higher in terms of the share< share price right so as you can see share price right so as you can see Amazon< Amazon definitely is a very strong Amazon definitely is a very strong company< company in terms of the technicals and I company in terms of the technicals and I would< would say it's a good candidate for the would say it's a good candidate for the wheel< wheel strategy as well now finally the wheel strategy as well now finally the third< third and final stock is palente tier so third and final stock is palente tier so palente< palente tier at the moment is currently palente tier at the moment is currently $37.

com blueprint all< all right back to the video so first of all right back to the video so first of all< all is the company profitable well as all is the company profitable well as you< you can see over here as of 2023 Helen you can see over here as of 2023 Helen here< here is profitable right it has a net here is profitable right it has a net income< income of 209 million thereabouts and a income of 209 million thereabouts and a net< net profit margin on net 43 and it has net profit margin on net 43 and it has increased< increased from its previous year so rule increased from its previous year so rule number< number one the criteria has already been number one the criteria has already been satisfied< satisfied it is a profitable company as satisfied it is a profitable company as of of of 2023< 2023 now what about rule number two does 2023 now what about rule number two does it< it have increasing revenue and profits it have increasing revenue and profits over< over the past few years so pentier over the past few years so pentier unfortunately< unfortunately does not have rule number unfortunately does not have rule number two< two criteria fulfilled right because as two criteria fulfilled right because as you< you can see for the years from 2019 all you can see for the years from 2019 all the< the way to 2022 it was actually still in the way to 2022 it was actually still in a< a loss but it does have increasing a loss but it does have increasing Revenue< Revenue so why do I still select pener Revenue so why do I still select pener as< as one of the real strategies well first as one of the real strategies well first of< of all I would say pener is a little bit of all I would say pener is a little bit more< more speculative but it actually I would more speculative but it actually I would say< say it has potential to start to do very say it has potential to start to do very well< well in the long term because even well in the long term because even though< though it was losing you know at least though it was losing you know at least from< from this point from 2019 2022 you can from this point from 2019 2022 you can see< see from 2020 onwards the losses has see from 2020 onwards the losses has been< been getting smaller and smaller. until a been getting smaller and smaller until a point< point in 2023 it finally turned a profit point in 2023 it finally turned a profit and< and it has been increasing Revenue so I and it has been increasing Revenue so I definitely< definitely do think that pener has a definitely do think that pener has a good< good potential to do well in the long good potential to do well in the long term< term as long as the company continues to term as long as the company continues to be< be profitable so if you were to actually be profitable so if you were to actually take< take a look at the quarterly income take a look at the quarterly income statement< statement you will see that it's statement you will see that it's actually< actually doing pretty well right quarter actually doing pretty well right quarter on< on quarter as you can see since June on quarter as you can see since June 2023< 2023 you can see that the net income has 2023 you can see that the net income has actually< actually been steadily increasing along actually been steadily increasing along with< with the revenue so again like I with the revenue so again like I mentioned< mentioned I do think that palena do have mentioned I do think that palena do have the< the potential to be increasing over the the potential to be increasing over the next< next few years uh but it's a little bit next few years uh but it's a little bit more< more speculative compared to Amazon and more speculative compared to Amazon and Google< Google because it's not as established Google because it's not as established right< right at the moment uh it's relatively right at the moment uh it's relatively new< new company compared to them it has not new company compared to them it has not withstand< withstand many of the past Market withstand many of the past Market crashes< crashes but at the moment I do think crashes but at the moment I do think that< that it does have some potential so rule that it does have some potential so rule number< number three is paler undervalue so as number three is paler undervalue so as you< you can see over here according to you can see over here according to Simply< Simply Wall Street the fair value of Simply Wall Street the fair value of pener< pener is pener is $518< $518 and at the current price of $518 and at the current price of $372< $372 it is 28. 2% undervalue and always a $372 it is 28.

2% undervalue and always a good< good thing for us to see that it is good thing for us to see that it is significant< significant L under value and as you can significant L under value and as you can see< see over here uh simply Wall Street has see over here uh simply Wall Street has mentioned< mentioned that it's significantly below mentioned that it's significantly below fair< fair value which is by more than 20% so fair value which is by more than 20% so it< it passes rule number three now what it passes rule number three now what about< about rule number four so as you can see about rule number four so as you can see over< over here uh like I mentioned pener is a over here uh like I mentioned pener is a relatively< relatively new company so it doesn't relatively new company so it doesn't have< have that strong of a technicals have that strong of a technicals compared< compared to you know Amazon or Google compared to you know Amazon or Google but< but it did go through 2022 right as you but it did go through 2022 right as you can< can see over here it went down but then can see over here it went down but then now< now it has broken the high of where 2022 now it has broken the high of where 2022 once< once was and then it has shut up right once was and then it has shut up right so< so I do think again pener is a more so I do think again pener is a more speculative< speculative stock but I do think it has speculative stock but I do think it has some< some good potential so if you do want to some good potential so if you do want to will< will pener I would say a smaller will pener I would say a smaller allocation< allocation compared to Amazon and Google allocation compared to Amazon and Google okay< okay so now that I've shared with you okay so now that I've shared with you the< the three stocks for the wheel strategy the three stocks for the wheel strategy I'm< I'm not just going to stop there I'm I'm not just going to stop there I'm going< going to share with you how and when to going to share with you how and when to enter< enter into the wheel strategy for this enter into the wheel strategy for this stocks< stocks right so how do you get into the stocks right so how do you get into the wheel< wheel strategy so there are two methods wheel strategy so there are two methods for< for this so the very first method is the for this so the very first method is the traditional< traditional wheel strategy which traditional wheel strategy which basically< basically is what everybody is doing basically is what everybody is doing right< right so basically the traditional wheel right so basically the traditional wheel strategy< strategy is a single entry mechanism strategy is a single entry mechanism right< right you enter it one time wait until right you enter it one time wait until you< you know you get assigned and then once you know you get assigned and then once you're< you're assigned once the market goes you're assigned once the market goes back< back up you sell the cover call again back up you sell the cover call again right< right so how do you get into it so since right so how do you get into it so since it's< it's going to be single entry I do think it's going to be single entry I do think that< that the timing is a little bit more that the timing is a little bit more important< important than the next method which important than the next method which I'll< I'll share later on so for this what I I'll share later on so for this what I like< like to do is that I want to wait until like to do is that I want to wait until the< the stochastic is in the oversold the stochastic is in the oversold territory< territory before selling the cash sture territory before selling the cash sture output< output so remember we already have four output so remember we already have four rules< rules in our place the four Gooding rules in our place the four Gooding rules< rules this four criteria has really rules this four criteria has really helped< helped us choose and underline that we helped us choose and underline that we know< know that at least has the potential for know that at least has the potential for it< it to go up uh in the long term so right it to go up uh in the long term so right now< now we need to identify the timing for now we need to identify the timing for this< this so for this the timing is that we this so for this the timing is that we want< want to wait until the stochastics as want to wait until the stochastics as you< you can see over here by the way this is you can see over here by the way this is the< the slow stochastic a number of people the slow stochastic a number of people have< have asked which stochastic this is so have asked which stochastic this is so we< we want to wait for it to actually go we want to wait for it to actually go down< down into the oversold territory down down into the oversold territory down here< here and the price would most likely here and the price would most likely come< come down and then at the point in time come down and then at the point in time then< then you can start to sell the cash then you can start to sell the cash secure< secure now as for what DTE and what secure now as for what DTE and what Delta< Delta to choose generally for the wheel Delta to choose generally for the wheel strategy< strategy I like the DTE sometime around strategy I like the DTE sometime around a< a week or two weeks right because the a week or two weeks right because the whole< whole idea here is that I actually want whole idea here is that I actually want to< to get assigned right I want to get into to get assigned right I want to get into the< the stock position the stock position and< and then if the market goes up I'm going and then if the market goes up I'm going to< to get capital gains on that as well and to get capital gains on that as well and also< also for the Delta I like to actually also for the Delta I like to actually choose< choose somewhere around at the money choose somewhere around at the money right< right because again like I mentioned I right because again like I mentioned I want< want to get assigned so that is why at want to get assigned so that is why at the< the money have the higher chances of you the money have the higher chances of you getting< getting assigned right too many times getting assigned right too many times you< you see people get into the wheel you see people get into the wheel strategy< strategy and then they sell a Delta strategy and then they sell a Delta that's< that's so far away right maybe like 20 that's so far away right maybe like 20 Deltas< Deltas or even 10 Delta hoping to just Deltas or even 10 Delta hoping to just get< get the premium right the thing is that get the premium right the thing is that yes< yes you get the premium but that's only yes you get the premium but that's only because< because maybe the stock has already shot because maybe the stock has already shot up< up up all the way right it may have come up up all the way right it may have come down< down a little bit and maybe your 10 down a little bit and maybe your 10 Delta< Delta or 20 Delta is somewhere here it Delta or 20 Delta is somewhere here it didn't< didn't touch here and it goes all the didn't touch here and it goes all the way< way up and then you only get the premium way up and then you only get the premium but< but had you been assigned the stock you but had you been assigned the stock you would< would actually captured this move down would actually captured this move down here< here which you get the capital gains here which you get the capital gains which< which is going to be a very big part of which is going to be a very big part of the< the amount the profit that you're going the amount the profit that you're going to< to make from the wheel strategy right so to make from the wheel strategy right so that< that is why I like to go somewhere that is why I like to go somewhere around< around where the current market price is around where the current market price is somewhere< somewhere around at the money hopefully somewhere around at the money hopefully I< I do get a sign Market comes down and I do get a sign Market comes down and then< then if I do get a signed Market is then if I do get a signed Market is going< going to go up now if I don't get a going to go up now if I don't get a signed< signed then I'm going to just sell the signed then I'm going to just sell the put< put option over and over again until I put option over and over again until I get< get a sign now as for the exit then it's get a sign now as for the exit then it's going< going to be the opposite right I'm going going to be the opposite right I'm going to< to wait until the stochastic is in the to wait until the stochastic is in the overboard< overboard region and then I'm going to overboard region and then I'm going to start< start to sell my cover call now the start to sell my cover call now the other< other way is that if you want to take a other way is that if you want to take a longer< longer term stunts whereby you want to longer term stunts whereby you want to wait< wait until the valuation price has been wait until the valuation price has been hit< hit so as you can see down here this is hit so as you can see down here this is Google< Google so Google valuation is I think Google so Google valuation is I think somewhere< somewhere around 200 plus so what you somewhere around 200 plus so what you. could< could do is that once you assigned you could do is that once you assigned you could< could also wait until the price go all could also wait until the price go all the< the way until P the valuation price then the way until P the valuation price then you< you sell the cover call so if you do you sell the cover call so if you do that< that then you're going to get a much that then you're going to get a much bigger< bigger capital gains but at the same bigger capital gains but at the same time< time you have to be prepared to be you time you have to be prepared to be you know< know this is going to be less active know this is going to be less active kind< kind of trade right that means you're kind of trade right that means you're just< just pretty much going to hold the just pretty much going to hold the position< position until it goes up but if you position until it goes up but if you want< want to take a little bit more active want to take a little bit more active approach< approach then you can just simply sell approach then you can just simply sell the< the cover call one it's overbought and the cover call one it's overbought and then< then once it come all the way down again then once it come all the way down again once< once it's oversold then you sell the put once it's oversold then you sell the put option< option again and then you rinse and option again and then you rinse and repeat< repeat okay so this is Method number one repeat okay so this is Method number one now< now method number two is the income grid now method number two is the income grid wheel< wheel strategy and this is where you wheel strategy and this is where you have< have multiple entry so I've already have multiple entry so I've already talked< talked about this in a separate video talked about this in a separate video very< very much more in depth uh but I'll just very much more in depth uh but I'll just go< go through the overview here so if you go through the overview here so if you want< want to go more in depth into want to go more in depth into understanding< understanding what this income grid understanding what this income grid wheel< wheel strategy is just go to my channel wheel strategy is just go to my channel and< and just type income grid wheel strategy and just type income grid wheel strategy so< so for this method for the entry we're so for this method for the entry we're pretty< pretty much just going to stagger the pretty much just going to stagger the cash< cash secure outputs right so you can do cash secure outputs right so you can do this< this according to you know fixed price this according to you know fixed price intervals< intervals so maybe every $5 $10 or intervals so maybe every $5 $10 or whatever< whatever it is and the other way is to whatever it is and the other way is to stagger< stagger them by percentage level so stagger them by percentage level so maybe< maybe each uh level will be a certain maybe each uh level will be a certain percentage< percentage apart maybe 5% apart or 3% percentage apart maybe 5% apart or 3% apart< apart so on and so forth right so apart so on and so forth right so basically< basically you want to have multiple basically you want to have multiple levels< levels so you are not too concerned levels so you are not too concerned about< about the time because we know that the about the time because we know that the market< market in the long term hopefully goes market in the long term hopefully goes up< up right especially according to the up right especially according to the four< four golden rules which we have already four golden rules which we have already chosen< chosen the stock so we've really done chosen the stock so we've really done the< the due diligence on the stock part now the due diligence on the stock part now in< in terms of the timing we don't really in terms of the timing we don't really have< have to be too particular right because have to be too particular right because once< once the market comes down uh we will once the market comes down uh we will just< just sell the cash cput the next level just sell the cash cput the next level again< again comes down then we sell again so again comes down then we sell again so we< we sell one by one and then once we get we sell one by one and then once we get filed< filed on the way up we can also sell the filed on the way up we can also sell the covered< covered call as well so for this I don't covered call as well so for this I don't really< really take a look at the St St castic really take a look at the St St castic but< but if you want to as well you can maybe but if you want to as well you can maybe for< for example if it comes down to the for example if it comes down to the oversold< oversold region and then you want to oversold region and then you want to start< start doing the levels staggering your start doing the levels staggering your cash< cash SEC output you can as well so for cash SEC output you can as well so for the< the exit same thing as well you want to the exit same thing as well you want to stagger< stagger your cover calls on the way up stagger your cover calls on the way up so< so for this you can either wait until so for this you can either wait until it's< it's overboard and then you start to it's overboard and then you start to sell< sell the cover calls again once for sell the cover calls again once for example< example if at this point it's overboard example if at this point it's overboard you< you sell this first cover call and then you sell this first cover call and then once< once it goes past this cover call you once it goes past this cover call you can< can sell the next one and so on and so can sell the next one and so on and so forth< forth right so again I've already forth right so again I've already covered< covered this in another video you can go covered this in another video you can go to< to my channel and search for the income to my channel and search for the income G< G real strategy explain it much more in G real strategy explain it much more in detail< detail there so the other way is that detail there so the other way is that you< you can wait until it's uh over the you can wait until it's uh over the valuation< valuation price so again wait until the valuation price so again wait until the market< market has gone all the way up to about market has gone all the way up to about $200< $200 plus then you start to sell the $200 plus then you start to sell the cover< cover call so for this no right and cover call so for this no right and wrong< wrong really comes down to how active wrong really comes down to how active you< you want to be right so the only you want to be right so the only difference< difference between method one and Method difference between method one and Method two< two is the capital intensiveness right two is the capital intensiveness right so< so method two is is going to be a little so method two is is going to be a little bit< bit more Capital intensive so you bit more Capital intensive so you definitely< definitely need to have a much bigger definitely need to have a much bigger Capital< Capital but if you don't have that much Capital but if you don't have that much of< of a bigger Capital then you can go for of a bigger Capital then you can go for method< method one all right guys so these are method one all right guys so these are the< the three stocks that you can use the the three stocks that you can use the wheel< wheel strategy on and I've been Wheeling wheel strategy on and I've been Wheeling them< them for quite some time it has been them for quite some time it has been doing< doing very well for me so definitely do doing very well for me so definitely do try< try that out using either method one or try that out using either method one or method< method two by the way if you like this method two by the way if you like this video< video

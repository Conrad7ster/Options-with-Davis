### The Complete Beginner's Guide To Managing Losing Iron Condors-6aR57Wu6myg
=============================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video let's< let's talk about how to manage losing let's talk about how to manage losing iron< iron Condor so in my previous video I iron Condor so in my previous video I talked< talked about how to manage losing credit talked about how to manage losing credit spreads< spreads if you haven't already watched spreads if you haven't already watched that< that just go ahead to my channel and you that just go ahead to my channel and you will< will find it there so for this video will find it there so for this video let's< let's talk about how to manage losing let's talk about how to manage losing iron< iron Condors because the iron Condor is iron Condors because the iron Condor is a< a very different animal compared to the a very different animal compared to the credit< credit spread or more specifically the credit spread or more specifically the individual< individual credit spread like the blue individual credit spread like the blue put< put spread and the bear call spread and put spread and the bear call spread and the< the reason is because now this time you the reason is because now this time you have< have on both sides right so this is an have on both sides right so this is an iron< iron control that I put on for the iron control that I put on for the spiders spiders spiders now< now I have many different trades on on now I have many different trades on on the< the index ETF so this is just one of the the index ETF so this is just one of the many< many trades which I have on so this is a many trades which I have on so this is a skewed< skewed iron Condor so basically a skewed skewed iron Condor so basically a skewed iron< iron Condor is whereby you have very iron Condor is whereby you have very different< different size width on each side so as different size width on each side so as you< you can see for the put side it is you can see for the put side it is slightly< slightly bigger than on the call side slightly bigger than on the call side because< because of the skew right so for index because of the skew right so for index ETFs< ETFs such as the spiders the qqqs iwms ETFs such as the spiders the qqqs iwms they< they have put skew so basically what it they have put skew so basically what it means< means is that your options on the put means is that your options on the put side< side will be slightly more expensive and side will be slightly more expensive and that's< that's only because the perceived Risk that's only because the perceived Risk by< by the market is to the downside right by the market is to the downside right so< so at the same time when you put on this so at the same time when you put on this skewed< skewed iron Condor you'll notice that skewed iron Condor you'll notice that for< for the put side it's always going to be for the put side it's always going to be wider< wider so what this iron Condor is is wider so what this iron Condor is is basically< basically I have 16 Deltas on both sides basically I have 16 Deltas on both sides for< for the short options and for the long for the short options and for the long options< options right they are both five Deltas options right they are both five Deltas right< right so you can go ahead to your option right so you can go ahead to your option chain< chain and you'll notice that for the 16 chain and you'll notice that for the 16 Deltas< Deltas as well as for the five Deltas Deltas as well as for the five Deltas they< they are pretty much further away from they are pretty much further away from each< each other each other in< in terms of distance from the market for in terms of distance from the market for the< the put side and the call side right so the put side and the call side right so for< for example the put side you'll notice for example the put side you'll notice that< that it might be maybe 20 30 dollars that it might be maybe 20 30 dollars wide< wide but whereas on the call side it wide but whereas on the call side it might< might be only maybe 20 or 25 dollars might be only maybe 20 or 25 dollars wide< wide all right so this is the difference wide all right so this is the difference between< between a normal iron Condor and a between a normal iron Condor and a skewed< skewed iron Condor so if you're just skewed iron Condor so if you're just starting< starting out I don't want you to be too starting out I don't want you to be too concerned< concerned or too worried about this you concerned or too worried about this you might< might just want to go with the standard might just want to go with the standard width< width which is maybe like ten dollars width which is maybe like ten dollars wide< wide on each side all right but in terms wide on each side all right but in terms of< of how you manage this losing iron of how you manage this losing iron Condors< Condors they are the same all right Condors they are the same all right they're< they're pretty much the same all right they're pretty much the same all right so< so in this case you can see that this is so in this case you can see that this is an< an iron Condor so the iron Condor is an iron Condor so the iron Condor is very< very different compared to the credit very different compared to the credit spreads< spreads because if you were to put on spreads because if you were to put on just< just a boot put spread let's say for just a boot put spread let's say for example< example just the poo poo spread and the example just the poo poo spread and the market< market was to trade up from this point market was to trade up from this point in< in time you're going to see that your in time you're going to see that your put< put spread is going to be very put spread is going to be very profitable< profitable right you're going to be in profitable right you're going to be in profit< profit immediately no matter how far it profit immediately no matter how far it goes< goes both uh similarly with the credit goes both uh similarly with the credit spread< spread for the call side of the bare spread for the call side of the bare call< call spread if the market goes down then call spread if the market goes down then you're< you're going to see a profit on the call you're going to see a profit on the call spread< spread all right but for the iron Condor spread all right but for the iron Condor because< because you have on both sides right the because you have on both sides right the combination< combination of both the back on the blue combination of both the back on the blue put< put it's very easy for you to see a loss put it's very easy for you to see a loss at< at any point in time during your trade at any point in time during your trade right< right at any time when you're holding on right at any time when you're holding on to< to the iron Condor for days or weeks to the iron Condor for days or weeks right< right it's it's quite easy for you to right it's it's quite easy for you to see< see a loss because you have this see a loss because you have this friction< friction on both sides so if the market friction on both sides so if the market is< is to go up all right even just a little is to go up all right even just a little bit< bit maybe somewhere down here you're bit maybe somewhere down here you're gonna< gonna see that your put spread is going gonna see that your put spread is going to< to be in a profit but your call spread to be in a profit but your call spread is< is going to be in a loss similarly if is going to be in a loss similarly if the< the market just trades down a little bit the market just trades down a little bit you're< you're gonna see a profit on your call you're gonna see a profit on your call side< side but then your put spread is going side but then your put spread is going to< to be in a loss so overall it will come to be in a loss so overall it will come down< down to a loss all right so you do not down to a loss all right so you do not want< want to panic when that happens because want to panic when that happens because it< it is very common it's natural the way it is very common it's natural the way you< you make money on your iron control is you make money on your iron control is as< as time passes as time passes then< then your profit will start to show so then your profit will start to show so for< for you to really understand how an iron for you to really understand how an iron Condor< Condor works or behave you want to take Condor works or behave you want to take a< a look at the risk profile right so this a look at the risk profile right so this is< is the risk profile of the iron Condor is the risk profile of the iron Condor right< right a normal width iron Contour with right a normal width iron Contour with 10< 10 wide on both sides it's also pretty 10 wide on both sides it's also pretty similar< similar so what you notice is that there similar so what you notice is that there are< are two lines all right so you'll see are two lines all right so you'll see the< the green line so the green line is the green line so the green line is basically< basically the wrist profile or rather basically the wrist profile or rather the< the p l graph for it when it hits the p l graph for it when it hits expiration< expiration right when it's at expiration expiration right when it's at expiration whereas< whereas for the purple line it's the whereas for the purple line it's the current< current day right so when you put it on current day right so when you put it on you'll< you'll see this purple line and over you'll see this purple line and over time< time this purple line will conform to time this purple line will conform to this< this green color line down here this green color line down here basically< basically it will change so from this basically it will change so from this point< point on you can see that the purple point on you can see that the purple line< line right over time as it goes closer line right over time as it goes closer to< to expression it will go up closer to to expression it will go up closer to this< this green line whereas when it goes this green line whereas when it goes past< past this point it will start to go down past this point it will start to go down to< to conform to this green line down here to conform to this green line down here similarly< similarly down here as well so you can similarly down here as well so you can see< see that as long as the market just see that as long as the market just moves< moves even though it moves you know it moves even though it moves you know it doesn't< doesn't really have that much of a big doesn't really have that much of a big move< move to test your short strikes right on move to test your short strikes right on both< both sides you can see that it can be in both sides you can see that it can be in a< a loss all right you can see that at a loss all right you can see that at this< this point of time let's say it goes to this point of time let's say it goes to this< this point down here let's say it comes this point down here let's say it comes down< down here right let's say the market down here right let's say the market made< made a big move it comes down here you made a big move it comes down here you will< will see that it's in a loss okay but it will see that it's in a loss okay but it is< is still well within the profit zone of is still well within the profit zone of the< the iron Condor because the iron Condor the iron Condor because the iron Condor profit< profit Zone as you can see is from this profit Zone as you can see is from this point< point all the way to here right so this point all the way to here right so this is< is actually past your shots right so is actually past your shots right so your< your short strikes are at this point your short strikes are at this point this< this is where your short strike is this this is where your short strike is this is< is where the shot put this is where the is where the shot put this is where the shot< shot call is and then your long call shot call is and then your long call so< so your long call is here and your long so your long call is here and your long put< put will be down here so what you want put will be down here so what you want to< to take note of down here is where your to take note of down here is where your break< break even point is so let me just break even point is so let me just remove< remove all these drawings so the point remove all these drawings so the point you< you really want to take note is this you really want to take note is this break< break even point so that means past this break even point so that means past this point< point and expression is where you will point and expression is where you will start< start to lose money anywhere within start to lose money anywhere within there< there as long as it stays within this there as long as it stays within this break< break even point this to break even break even point this to break even Point< Point you're going to be in profit at Point you're going to be in profit at expression< expression so with this in mind what you expression so with this in mind what you want< want to do is take note of the want to do is take note of the break-even< break-even point so you can see the break-even point so you can see the breaking< breaking point on both sides breaking point on both sides it< it will be they'll show exactly what is it will be they'll show exactly what is the< the amount so you can actually put this the amount so you can actually put this on< on your chart you can you can put the on your chart you can you can put the points< points down there some something like points down there some something like this< this right so what you want to see is this right so what you want to see is that< that if the market is still trading well that if the market is still trading well within< within the break-even point guess what within the break-even point guess what there< there is nothing to do right so if the there is nothing to do right so if the market< market is inside the break-even point do market is inside the break-even point do nothing< nothing right do not be over active nothing right do not be over active where< where you try and manage it when you try where you try and manage it when you try to< to shift this in or you try to close out to shift this in or you try to close out one< one side and hopefully you know the one side and hopefully you know the other< other side rebounds back other side rebounds back ideally< ideally if you put on as an iron Condor ideally if you put on as an iron Condor you< you want to exit as an iron Condor as you want to exit as an iron Condor as well< well right I'm not a big proponent of well right I'm not a big proponent of Shifting< Shifting this here and there if it Shifting this here and there if it doesn't< doesn't actually uh go past your break doesn't actually uh go past your break even< even point because remember you want even point because remember you want time< time to be on your side time is on your time to be on your side time is on your side< side you have Theta Decay right so iron side you have Theta Decay right so iron Condor< Condor is a Theta Decay kind of strategy Condor is a Theta Decay kind of strategy where< where you have time Decay working where you have time Decay working outside< outside so as time passes as long as outside so as time passes as long as it's< it's within this Zone slowly this will it's within this Zone slowly this will go< go up you're gonna make money on this go up you're gonna make money on this all< all right so with an iron Condor you all right so with an iron Condor you want< want to give it time to really nurture want to give it time to really nurture mature< mature and finally give you the profits mature and finally give you the profits. which< which you want if it's inside the profit which you want if it's inside the profit zone< zone now what if the market is outside zone now what if the market is outside of< of the break-even what if it really of the break-even what if it really moves< moves uh such uh it has such a big move moves uh such uh it has such a big move that< that it goes past your Breakeven Point that it goes past your Breakeven Point well< well at this point then this is well at this point then this is something< something where you might need to do something where you might need to do something< something and it depends on whether it's something and it depends on whether it's past< past the 21 days to expiration month all past the 21 days to expiration month all right< right so 21 days to expiration Mark is a right so 21 days to expiration Mark is a focal< focal point on where you start to manage focal point on where you start to manage your< your options and the reason why you want your options and the reason why you want to< to manage at 21 days of expression well to manage at 21 days of expression well one< one of the reason is because when you go one of the reason is because when you go past< past 31 days to expiration Mark and your past 31 days to expiration Mark and your options< options right your short strike your options right your short strike your short< short call and your short put when they short call and your short put when they are< are both in the money this is where the are both in the money this is where the chances< chances of you getting assigned chances of you getting assigned increases< increases right if the market goes past increases right if the market goes past this< this shot put that's less than 21 days this shot put that's less than 21 days then< then your extrinsic value is decreasing then your extrinsic value is decreasing rapidly< rapidly by the day right so what rapidly by the day right so what determines< determines whether your short strikes determines whether your short strikes whether< whether your short call or your short whether your short call or your short put< put is going to be exercised by the put is going to be exercised by the buyer< buyer of this option comes down to how buyer of this option comes down to how much< much extrinsic value there is left in much extrinsic value there is left in this< this option well basically the rule of this option well basically the rule of thumb< thumb is that when there is very little thumb is that when there is very little extrinsic< extrinsic value left then there's a very extrinsic value left then there's a very high< high chance for you to get exercise and high chance for you to get exercise and extrinsic< extrinsic value also got to do with how extrinsic value also got to do with how deep< deep in the money the option is that deep in the money the option is that means< means if the option is really deep in means if the option is really deep in the< the money then there's going to be a lot the money then there's going to be a lot of< of intrinsic value but very little of intrinsic value but very little extrinsic< extrinsic value so that's when you're extrinsic value so that's when you're going< going to have a high chance or rather an going to have a high chance or rather an increased< increased chance of getting assigned and increased chance of getting assigned and also< also as it gets closer and closer to also as it gets closer and closer to expiration< expiration date remember at expiration expiration date remember at expiration all< all options lose their extrinsic value all options lose their extrinsic value right< right extrinsic value goes to zero so as right extrinsic value goes to zero so as you< you get closer and closer to the you get closer and closer to the expiration< expiration date you're also going to expiration date you're also going to lose< lose a lot of your extrinsic value lose a lot of your extrinsic value because< because that's when Theta Decay really because that's when Theta Decay really rapidly< rapidly increases to Decay the value of rapidly increases to Decay the value of the< the options right so when your past 21 the options right so when your past 21 days< days your expiration mark this is where days your expiration mark this is where your< your chances of getting assigned is your chances of getting assigned is going< going to be higher but if it is above to going to be higher but if it is above to 31< 31 days to expiration amount then guess 31 days to expiration amount then guess what< what you're going to still have a what you're going to still have a reasonable< reasonable amount of extrinsic value reasonable amount of extrinsic value because< because there's still quite a bit of because there's still quite a bit of time< time right so when there's quite a bit time right so when there's quite a bit of< of time usually the bias of these two of time usually the bias of these two options< options they won't really want to options they won't really want to exercise< exercise the option right because they exercise the option right because they will< will be losing the extrinsic value will be losing the extrinsic value they'll< they'll be giving up the extrinsic value they'll be giving up the extrinsic value if< if they exercise right the better way if they exercise right the better way for< for them to actually manage it would be for them to actually manage it would be to< to just sell off the option and to rip to just sell off the option and to rip the< the profits right with the extrinsic the profits right with the extrinsic value< value so it really makes no sense for value so it really makes no sense for them< them to really exercise it early if the them to really exercise it early if the extrinsic< extrinsic value is still pretty high so extrinsic value is still pretty high so a< a safe margin or rather a good margin of a safe margin or rather a good margin of safety< safety where you know there's a lesser safety where you know there's a lesser chance< chance of getting a sign is when there's chance of getting a sign is when there's more< more than 21 days to expiration now the more than 21 days to expiration now the other< other reason why we want to manage at 21 other reason why we want to manage at 21 days< days of expression is because there has days of expression is because there has been< been studies Already Done Right in-depth been studies Already Done Right in-depth studies< studies and research that when you studies and research that when you manage< manage your traits especially for in manage your traits especially for in this< this case iron Condor when you manage it this case iron Condor when you manage it at< at 21 days to expiration you will find at 21 days to expiration you will find that< that your results are actually better that your results are actually better right< right so if you can see this is study right so if you can see this is study done< done by the tasty trade team they have done by the tasty trade team they have done< done really in-depth Research into this done really in-depth Research into this so< so for the iron condor in this case the so for the iron condor in this case the 20< 20 Delta five dollar white iron Condor 20 Delta five dollar white iron Condor you< you can see that if you hold it to you can see that if you hold it to expiration< expiration your win rate is only 66 but expiration your win rate is only 66 but if< if you were to close it up or manage it if you were to close it up or manage it at< at 21 days to expression then your win at 21 days to expression then your win rate< rate is 72 percent it's much higher rate is 72 percent it's much higher right< right at the same time your daily p l is right at the same time your daily p l is higher< higher as well you can see this is 60 higher as well you can see this is 60 cents< cents compared to 34 cents so there is cents compared to 34 cents so there is definitely< definitely much more benefit when you definitely much more benefit when you manage< manage it at 21 days of expiration and manage it at 21 days of expiration and this< this is generally the rule of thumb this is generally the rule of thumb which< which is what we want to do when you are which is what we want to do when you are selling< selling options right when you're selling options right when you're selling< selling premium 21 days of expiration is selling premium 21 days of expiration is the< the point where you want to start to do the point where you want to start to do something< something all right so the other thing something all right so the other thing which< which you want to see is that you can which you want to see is that you can see< see that the performance at 21 days see that the performance at 21 days expression< expression when you manage it is expression when you manage it is significantly< significantly much better than if you significantly much better than if you were< were told to expression right you can were told to expression right you can see< see that as you as time goes past right see that as you as time goes past right you< you trade pass around from 2011 you trade pass around from 2011 all< all the way to 2018 and so on 2020 you all the way to 2018 and so on 2020 you can< can see that the performance of the 21 can see that the performance of the 21 days< days expiration really outshines if you days expiration really outshines if you were< were to hold it to uh just to expiration were to hold it to uh just to expiration right< right so that is the reason why I right so that is the reason why I generally< generally manage my options at 21 days generally manage my options at 21 days to< to expression all right so what do you to expression all right so what do you do< do if it's outside the break-even at 21 do if it's outside the break-even at 21 days< days right when there's still more than days right when there's still more than 21< 21 days to expiration basically when 21 days to expiration basically when there's< there's more than 21 days of expiration there's more than 21 days of expiration you< you pretty much just do nothing right you pretty much just do nothing right just< just let the trade work out let Theta just let the trade work out let Theta Decay< Decay work in your favor and you never Decay work in your favor and you never know< know right the market can always come know right the market can always come back< back up back up if< if you want to manage too early then if you want to manage too early then guess< guess what you have removed the chances guess what you have removed the chances of< of you being profitable because you of you being profitable because you didn't< didn't give enough time for the trade to didn't give enough time for the trade to work< work out don't forget when you are work out don't forget when you are putting< putting on an Iron Condor you've already putting on an Iron Condor you've already got< got the long option in place right the got the long option in place right the long< long option basically already limits long option basically already limits your< your maximum risk so if the market goes your maximum risk so if the market goes to< to zero or it shoots all the way to the to zero or it shoots all the way to the Moon< Moon you don't have to worry because you Moon you don't have to worry because you already< already have the maximum loss defined in already have the maximum loss defined in place< place you already know what's the worst place you already know what's the worst result< result that can happen and when you put result that can happen and when you put on< on this trade in the first place this on this trade in the first place this maximum< maximum risk should be based on the maximum risk should be based on the capital< capital allocation that you are capital allocation that you are comfortable< comfortable with right that you are comfortable with right that you are certain< certain that you know even though if you certain that you know even though if you hit< hit the max loss it's not going to hit the max loss it's not going to destroy< destroy your account right so that's why destroy your account right so that's why it< it has to be a small percentage of your it has to be a small percentage of your account< account okay account okay so< so what do you do if there's less than so what do you do if there's less than 21< 21 days left right if there's less to 21 21 days left right if there's less to 21 days< days left and your break even points days left and your break even points have< have been breached well the first thing have been breached well the first thing that< that you can do the first option the that you can do the first option the very< very simple option to do is to simply very simple option to do is to simply just< just take a loss right this is actually just take a loss right this is actually my< my default option and the one that I my default option and the one that I like< like best because for me personally I like best because for me personally I have< have many trades on right I could be have many trades on right I could be managing< managing up to 20 trades at one time on managing up to 20 trades at one time on the< the same uh product on the same index the same uh product on the same index ETF< ETF so for me to manage every single one ETF so for me to manage every single one of< of them it's gonna get so confusing of them it's gonna get so confusing right< right you want me to to manage this by right you want me to to manage this by you< you know closing this or turning this to you know closing this or turning this to the< the different trade or to roll this in the different trade or to roll this in and< and out it's too confusing for me right and out it's too confusing for me right I'd< I'd rather just take my loss so one I'd rather just take my loss so one thing< thing that you want to understand is thing that you want to understand is that< that you will have losses right so if that you will have losses right so if you< you want to take a look at the p l graph you want to take a look at the p l graph you'll< you'll notice that you have a pretty you'll notice that you have a pretty high< high win rate right this is about 85 but high win rate right this is about 85 but this< this doesn't mean you're going to win this doesn't mean you're going to win all< all the time right there is chances all the time right there is chances there< there are chances that you're still there are chances that you're still going< going to lose right there's ten percent going to lose right there's ten percent sometimes< sometimes you're going to lose on the sometimes you're going to lose on the upside< upside and there's about five to six upside and there's about five to six percent< percent chance you're gonna lose on the percent chance you're gonna lose on the downside< downside right but I know that I'm going downside right but I know that I'm going to< to win the majority of the time so to win the majority of the time so there's< there's no need for me to make sure that there's no need for me to make sure that every< every single trade turns out to be a every single trade turns out to be a winner< winner if that trade at 21 days is a winner if that trade at 21 days is a loss< loss then guess what I'm just going to loss then guess what I'm just going to close< close you out take the loss put on close you out take the loss put on another< another trade again another trade again so< so that's the first option that you can so that's the first option that you can take< take the very simple one by the way if take the very simple one by the way if you< you like this video so far Please

com blueprint or< or right back to the video or right back to the video now< now the next option you can take is if now the next option you can take is if you< you are wanting to fight feedback right you are wanting to fight feedback right that< that means you do not want to take a that means you do not want to take a loss< loss there's nothing wrong with that by loss there's nothing wrong with that by the< the way if you think that the market may the way if you think that the market may come< come back or you want to hold on to it come back or you want to hold on to it in< in case the market comes back you can as in case the market comes back you can as well< well so what you can do is to roll out well so what you can do is to roll out the< the whole iron condor out if you can get the whole iron condor out if you can get a< a credit right so for example let's say a credit right so for example let's say the< the market trades somewhere around here the market trades somewhere around here and< and it's still inside your strikes so if and it's still inside your strikes so if it's< it's still inside your strikes in this it's still inside your strikes in this case< case but it's already past 21 days right case but it's already past 21 days right in< in this case you can actually still hold in this case you can actually still hold on< on to the trade because if you were to on to the trade because if you were to take< take a look at the p l graph again all take a look at the p l graph again all right< right let's just remove all this drawing right let's just remove all this drawing let's< let's say it's somewhere down here right let's say it's somewhere down here right past< past 21 days to expression maybe there's past 21 days to expression maybe there's 20< 20 days to expiration left so if you 20 days to expiration left so if you were< were to hold on to this all the way to were to hold on to this all the way to expiration< expiration and given the fact we assume expiration and given the fact we assume that< that the market actually stays your that the market actually stays your expression< expression guess what you're still going expression guess what you're still going to< to slowly profit because over time this to slowly profit because over time this purple< purple line is going to go up to match purple line is going to go up to match this< this green color line so you're still this green color line so you're still well< well within the profit Zone right but well within the profit Zone right but the< the thing that you want to understand as the thing that you want to understand as well< well is that this line will start to get well is that this line will start to get steeper< steeper as well it starts to get steeper steeper as well it starts to get steeper as< as you can see this line down here is as you can see this line down here is pretty< pretty steep compared to this purple pretty steep compared to this purple line< line so as it gets deeper what it also line so as it gets deeper what it also means< means is that as long as the market means is that as long as the market moves< moves against you that means let's say moves against you that means let's say it< it continues to move down then guess it continues to move down then guess what< what the loss you're going to take is what the loss you're going to take is going< going to be much faster as well because going to be much faster as well because you're< you're going to have an accelerated loss you're going to have an accelerated loss to< to the downside but of course you also to the downside but of course you also have< have an accelerated gain to the upside have an accelerated gain to the upside because< because the curve is steeper as well because the curve is steeper as well so< so at this point of time you are quite so at this point of time you are quite subjected< subjected to the underlying movement subjected to the underlying movement right< right you're much more sensitive so right you're much more sensitive so that's< that's why you it's kind of like a big that's why you it's kind of like a big risk< risk big reward kind of thing at this risk big reward kind of thing at this point< point because you can make more if the point because you can make more if the market< market moves towards the center of the market moves towards the center of the iron< iron Condor but if it moves away you can iron Condor but if it moves away you can lose< lose more as well so this really comes lose more as well so this really comes down< down to your decision right it's your down to your decision right it's your discretion< discretion if you're gonna hold on to it discretion if you're gonna hold on to it nothing< nothing wrong with that as well the nothing wrong with that as well the other< other alternative is to just roll the other alternative is to just roll the whole< whole iron condor out right so chances whole iron condor out right so chances are< are that if the price is still within are that if the price is still within the< the iron Condor at 21 days then guess the iron Condor at 21 days then guess what< what you can roll this whole iron condor what you can roll this whole iron condor out< out for a credit right chances are that out for a credit right chances are that you'll< you'll be able to get credit if it turns you'll be able to get credit if it turns out< out to be a debit then you do not want out to be a debit then you do not want to< to roll of course because ideally we do to roll of course because ideally we do not< not want the rule for debit we want to not want the rule for debit we want to roll< roll for a credit when you roll for a roll for a credit when you roll for a credit< credit you're essentially also giving credit you're essentially also giving time< time for the trade to work out at the time for the trade to work out at the same< same time you're reducing the max loss same time you're reducing the max loss as< as well although it's not going to be a as well although it's not going to be a huge< huge credit a little bit of credit can huge credit a little bit of credit can help< help right so what I also want to show help right so what I also want to show you< you that at 21 days of expiration this you that at 21 days of expiration this is< is how the graph actually looks like is how the graph actually looks like right< right so you can see that the purple right so you can see that the purple line< line starts to go up really slowly it's line starts to go up really slowly it's going< going up towards the green line slowly going up towards the green line slowly going< going to turn into the green line but going to turn into the green line but there< there are still areas within this profit there are still areas within this profit Zone< Zone from here to here that you could Zone from here to here that you could still< still be in a loss right for example at still be in a loss right for example at this< this point down here or at this point so this point down here or at this point so at< at 21 days to expiration you can see at 21 days to expiration you can see that< that you are in a loss although you are that you are in a loss although you are still< still in the profit zone so again at still in the profit zone so again at this< this point in time roll out the Hawaiian this point in time roll out the Hawaiian condo< condo if you want to put up more trade condo if you want to put up more trade so< so this way when you roll out the iron so this way when you roll out the iron Condor< Condor you're also smoothening out this Condor you're also smoothening out this purple< purple line again so this purple line purple line again so this purple line kind< kind of resets back right it resets back kind of resets back right it resets back to< to this so you're not as sensitive to to this so you're not as sensitive to Direction< Direction and you're just letting a Time Direction and you're just letting a Time Decay< Decay work in your favor but if you Decay work in your favor but if you don't< don't roll it out don't roll it out then< then you could just hold it all the way then you could just hold it all the way to< to expiration or closer expression when to expiration or closer expression when it< it comes back in then you can take it comes back in then you can take profit< profit as well so this is just some profit as well so this is just some ideas< ideas for you in case you plan to grow ideas for you in case you plan to grow up< up the whole iron condor up the whole iron condor now< now the third option you can do is to now the third option you can do is to Simply< Simply close out the untested site and Simply close out the untested site and then< then roll out the tester site if you can then roll out the tester site if you can get< get a credit so let's say for example get a credit so let's say for example the< the market goes down to test the put the market goes down to test the put side< side so let's say for example Market is side so let's say for example Market is at< at this point at the past the 21 days at this point at the past the 21 days expiration< expiration so at this point your call expiration so at this point your call spread< spread is close to a maximum profit spread is close to a maximum profit right< right maybe if you put on for let's say right maybe if you put on for let's say if< if you put it on for a dollar you might if you put it on for a dollar you might be< be seeing 90 cents in profit that means be seeing 90 cents in profit that means it's< it's it's worth 10 cents right now so it's it's worth 10 cents right now so what< what you could do is you can just close what you could do is you can just close out< out this whole call spread and then out this whole call spread and then manage< manage this as a single put spread by manage this as a single put spread by itself< itself so now you're managing as a bull itself so now you're managing as a bull put< put spread so how you manage this bull put spread so how you manage this bull pull< pull spread is that if you're able to pull spread is that if you're. able to get< get a credit you could roll it out if get a credit you could roll it out if you< you can't get a credit then what you can you can't get a credit then what you can do< do is you can actually hold it hopefully do is you can actually hold it hopefully the< the market does Rebound back up if it the market does Rebound back up if it does< does Rebound back up you can either does Rebound back up you can either close< close out for a profit or you could close out for a profit or you could choose< choose to roll it out again right so choose to roll it out again right so this< this is so in this big when you doing is this is so in this big when you doing is you're< you're pretty much splitting up the you're pretty much splitting up the trade< trade right you're taking a profit on trade right you're taking a profit on this< this so that you know you just live with this so that you know you just live with the< the put spread because maybe you're the put spread because maybe you're still< still bullish on it you think it's time still bullish on it you think it's time for< for it to rebound because the market has for it to rebound because the market has been< been pretty oversold at this point been pretty oversold at this point so< so if you did not close out this call so if you did not close out this call spread< spread if the market goes out then spread if the market goes out then you're< you're going to lose some of the profits you're going to lose some of the profits that< that you have already gotten on this that you have already gotten on this call< call side so again we don't know which call side so again we don't know which is< is the best move right you never know is the best move right you never know which< which is the best move until the market which is the best move until the market moves< moves because if you close out this and moves because if you close out this and the< the market goes further down then guess the market goes further down then guess what< what it's better for you to hold on with what it's better for you to hold on with this< this to at least get the remaining 10 this to at least get the remaining 10 cents< cents the kind of like cushion the cents the kind of like cushion the losses< losses on this side but if the market losses on this side but if the market goes< goes back up then closing this out would goes back up then closing this out would actually< actually be a good choice or a good actually be a good choice or a good method< method because you have already gotten method because you have already gotten most< most of the profit out of this and then most of the profit out of this and then now< now your put spread is going to be in a now your put spread is going to be in a profit< profit so that is the third option that profit so that is the third option that you< you can take now the last option would you can take now the last option would be< be to roll the whole iron condor out and be to roll the whole iron condor out and in< in the untested side all right so sounds in the untested side all right so sounds complicating< complicating but let me just explain it complicating but let me just explain it to< to you so let's say for example the to you so let's say for example the market< market goes down to test the put side market goes down to test the put side right< right so the market for your put side is right so the market for your put side is in< in the money past the break-even point in the money past the break-even point so< so what you want to do first of all is so what you want to do first of all is to< to close out you're this call spread and to close out you're this call spread and then< then this is what you call Rolling In then this is what you call Rolling In and< and Out All right so basically what and Out All right so basically what you're< you're doing is that you are shifting you're doing is that you are shifting your< your iron Condor closer to where the your iron Condor closer to where the market< market is right when you bring it down market is right when you bring it down and< and then you roll it out you get credit and then you roll it out you get credit right< right because when you are closer to the right because when you are closer to the market< market the credit which you have the market the credit which you have the premium< premium will always be higher so what premium will always be higher so what you're< you're doing is that you are trying to you're doing is that you are trying to get< get more credit and then at the same get more credit and then at the same time< time also reduce the maximum loss so time also reduce the maximum loss so when< when you do this you can actually do when you do this you can actually do this< this as a single role right what you this as a single role right what you want< want to do is you're rolling out to a want to do is you're rolling out to a further< further expiration date and rolling down further expiration date and rolling down towards< towards uh closer to the current price towards uh closer to the current price so< so you're going to get a credit on this so you're going to get a credit on this at< at the same time you can roll out your at the same time you can roll out your put< put spread as well so chances are that put spread as well so chances are that if< if your put spread is really in the if your put spread is really in the money< money then it will be a debit right but money then it will be a debit right but you< you want to roll both out because you you want to roll both out because you want< want to have both at the same expiration want to have both at the same expiration date< date so ideally what you're doing is date so ideally what you're doing is that< that hopefully the credit which you get that hopefully the credit which you get for< for this is much more than the debit for this is much more than the debit you're< you're paying to rule this uh to roll you're paying to rule this uh to roll this< this put spread out so let's say for this put spread out so let's say for example< example if you're paying let's say example if you're paying let's say you're< you're paying 50 cents to roll out this you're paying 50 cents to roll out this put< put spread but then by row rolling out put spread but then by row rolling out and< and rolling down your call spread you're and rolling down your call spread you're getting< getting a credit of let's say maybe a getting a credit of let's say maybe a dollar< dollar and 20 cents then guess what dollar and 20 cents then guess what you're< you're going to be in a net credit at you're going to be in a net credit at the< the end of the day you're gonna have a the end of the day you're gonna have a net< net credit of 70 cents for doing this net credit of 70 cents for doing this role< role so I know of some people who like role so I know of some people who like to< to do this because when you do this to do this because when you do this you're< you're reducing your risk you're also you're reducing your risk you're also giving< giving the trade to workout as well in giving the trade to workout as well in case< case you're right but I generally do not case you're right but I generally do not like< like this method the most out of the like this method the most out of the four< four right I'm not a big proponent of four right I'm not a big proponent of this< this method because although you have this method because although you have increased< increased the chances right that the increased the chances right that the market< market may come back up and you reduce market may come back up and you reduce your< your loss as well but the thing is that your loss as well but the thing is that you< you have reduced your probability of you have reduced your probability of profit< profit you see when you first start out profit you see when you first start out your< your iron condor your iron condor you< you have a pretty huge zone right so you have a pretty huge zone right so this< this is pretty much around a 60 win rate this is pretty much around a 60 win rate or< or so right so you have put on a roughly or so right so you have put on a roughly 60< 60 win rate but then when you start to 60 win rate but then when you start to roll< roll it out and down the call side roll it out and down the call side suddenly< suddenly now you are left with a very suddenly now you are left with a very small< small profit zone so even though if the small profit zone so even though if the market< market goes up guess what you're still market goes up guess what you're still going< going to be somewhat in a loss because going to be somewhat in a loss because you< you have reset the iron Condor and now you have reset the iron Condor and now your< your iron Condor needs time to work out your iron Condor needs time to work out need< need time to mature so you have such a need time to mature so you have such a small< small profit zone so if the market just small profit zone so if the market just goes< goes a little bit higher again guess goes a little bit higher again guess what< what you're going to be a loss again and what you're going to be a loss again and this< this is where it gets you know kind of this is where it gets you know kind of tricky< tricky what are you gonna do then so tricky what are you gonna do then so although< although there are some people that although there are some people that actually< actually does this this is not something actually does this this is not something that< that I like but you can definitely that I like but you can definitely reduce< reduce the loss the maximum loss on your reduce the loss the maximum loss on your trade< trade compared to when you first started trade compared to when you first started out< out right so let's say if you put on a out right so let's say if you put on a 10< 10 white iron Condor and let's say you 10 white iron Condor and let's say you receive< receive let's say two dollars fifty receive let's say two dollars fifty cents< cents in terms of credit so that leaves cents in terms of credit so that leaves you< you with a maximum loss of 7. 50 for the you with a maximum loss of 7.

50 for the iron< iron Condor right the maximum loss but iron Condor right the maximum loss but if< if you were to roll all this you get 70 if you were to roll all this you get 70 cents< cents in terms of credit or let's say cents in terms of credit or let's say for< for example you get a dollar a dollar for example you get a dollar a dollar fifty< fifty cents in terms of credit right and fifty cents in terms of credit right and guess< guess what then you're gonna reduce this guess what then you're gonna reduce this maximum< maximum loss from Seven dollars fifty maximum loss from Seven dollars fifty cents< cents to six dollars right if you get a cents to six dollars right if you get a dollar< dollar fifty cents in credit so now your dollar fifty cents in credit so now your maximum< maximum loss is only six dollars instead maximum loss is only six dollars instead of< of seven dollars fifty cents and you of seven dollars fifty cents and you still< still can get a profit if the market still can get a profit if the market really< really stays within this Zone close to really stays within this Zone close to expiration< expiration right so this are the four expiration right so this are the four options< options that you can take my favorite options that you can take my favorite one< one is this one is this take< take loss and then the rest really comes take loss and then the rest really comes down< down to up to you you can roll out the down to up to you you can roll out the whole< whole iron Condor if you can get a whole iron Condor if you can get a credit< credit or you can close out the untested credit or you can close out the untested site< site and then the tested side you can site and then the tested side you can manage< manage it as though as a single credit manage it as though as a single credit spread< spread which I also talked about this in spread which I also talked about this in my< my previous video which is how to manage my previous video which is how to manage you< you know losing credit spread you can go you know losing credit spread you can go and< and watch that video or if you want to and watch that video or if you want to be< be even more defensive this is pretty be even more defensive this is pretty defensive< defensive what you're doing is you're defensive what you're doing is you're rolling< rolling the whole iron condor out and rolling the whole iron condor out and then< then rolling in and out the untested. then rolling in and out the untested side< side so you get more credit to side so you get more credit to eventually< eventually reduce the maximum loss all eventually reduce the maximum loss all right< right guys so I hope this video has been right guys so I hope this video has been very< very helpful gives you a little bit more very helpful gives you a little bit more idea< idea into how you can manage losing iron idea into how you can manage losing iron Condor< Condor so the biggest takeaway I want to Condor so the biggest takeaway I want to give< give you for managing iron Condors is give you for managing iron Condors is that< that you do not need to make sure that that you do not need to make sure that every< every single trade you put on is going every single trade you put on is going to< to be profitable right there will always to be profitable right there will always be< be times where you have to take a loss be times where you have to take a loss right< right when you take a loss just take it right when you take a loss just take it remember< remember the probability is always on remember the probability is always on your< your side as an option seller you just your side as an option seller you just want< want to put it that consistently put it want to put it that consistently put it on< on consistently and over time let the on consistently and over time let the edge< edge play out right but on the other edge play out right but on the other hand< hand you want to manage it it's fine as hand you want to manage it it's fine as well< well so you can manage according to this well so you can manage according to this all< all right guys so I really hope this all right guys so I really hope this video< video has been helpful for you give you video has been helpful for you give you a< a little bit Insight how to manage your a little bit Insight how to manage your losing< losing iron Condor so if you like this losing iron Condor so if you like this video< video please give me a thumbs up as well video please give me a thumbs up as well as< as subscribe to my channel as well and as subscribe to my channel as well and by< by the way if you haven't gotten your by the way if you haven't gotten your free< free copy of the options income free copy of the options income blueprint< blueprint then you can go ahead and get blueprint then you can go ahead and get it< it at optionswith davis. com blueprint so it at optionswith davis.

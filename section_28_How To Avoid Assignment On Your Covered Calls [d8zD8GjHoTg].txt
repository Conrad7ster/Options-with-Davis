===============================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty So today we're gonna all right alrighty So today we're gonna be< be talking about assignment right more be talking about assignment right more specifically< specifically we're going to be talking specifically we're going to be talking about< about covered call assignment what about covered call assignment what happens< happens right if the stock shoots up to happens right if the stock shoots up to the< the moon and you know you have uh your the moon and you know you have uh your cover< cover call is now in the money and now cover call is now in the money and now you're< you're in danger of getting your shares you're in danger of getting your shares called< called away so you see I've even had a I called away so you see I've even had a I may< may have a picture of a moon to show you may have a picture of a moon to show you how< how high the stock can possibly go right how high the stock can possibly go right so so so the< the question is you know how can you the question is you know how can you avoid< avoid at least assignment when are you avoid at least assignment when are you really< really in danger of getting a sign and really in danger of getting a sign and what< what do you do if you are already what do you do if you are already assigned< assigned right so today we're going to assigned right so today we're going to be< be talking all about this and if you be talking all about this and if you have< have been selling covered calls or you have been selling covered calls or you want< want to sell cover calls then this is a want to sell cover calls then this is a very< very important topic for you to very important topic for you to understand< understand right so first of all you understand right so first of all you want< want to understand when are you actually want to understand when are you actually in< in danger of early assignment right so in danger of early assignment right so you're< you're in danger of early assignment you're in danger of early assignment well< well first of all when the cover call is well first of all when the cover call is in< in the money right so the only time in the money right so the only time where< where you can get a sign is if your where you can get a sign is if your cover< cover call is in the money if it's out cover call is in the money if it's out of< of the money you don't have to worry of the money you don't have to worry about< about anything right the next thing is about anything right the next thing is when< when the extrinsic value is very little when the extrinsic value is very little all< all right and I'll explain a little bit all right and I'll explain a little bit more< more later with a graph and explanation more later with a graph and explanation right< right so you get to understand a little right so you get to understand a little bit< bit better but for now just understand bit better but for now just understand that< that if you see that your cover call has that if you see that your cover call has very< very little extrinsic value then there very little extrinsic value then there is< is a chance that you get assigned but is a chance that you get assigned but it's< it's not guaranteed okay also there's uh it's not guaranteed okay also there's uh when< when there's very little days to when there's very little days to expiration expiration expiration right< right this that's the most likely the right this that's the most likely the chance< chance where you know when the option chance where you know when the option buyer< buyer the call buyer does not have that buyer the call buyer does not have that many< many days left expiration that's when many days left expiration that's when they< they would consider actually exercising they would consider actually exercising their< their option and then also when there's their option and then also when there's X< X dividend coming up where the dividend X dividend coming up where the dividend being< being paid out is more than the being paid out is more than the extrinsic< extrinsic value then there is. a much extrinsic value then there is a much greater< greater chance that your cover call greater chance that your cover call would< would get assigned so this is what you would get assigned so this is what you call< call dividend risk now while all these call dividend risk now while all these are< are signs right that you could get early are signs right that you could get early assigned< assigned one thing you need to assigned one thing you need to understand< understand is that the risk of actually understand is that the risk of actually getting< getting assigned is not as high as you getting assigned is not as high as you think< think right it doesn't mean that the think right it doesn't mean that the moment< moment that your cover call is in the moment that your cover call is in the money< money that you're going to get your money that you're going to get your shares< shares caught away or that the option is shares caught away or that the option is going< going to get exercise it doesn't happen going to get exercise it doesn't happen as< as often as you think so a lot of people as often as you think so a lot of people you< you know they get their cover call in you know they get their cover call in the< the money for example they saw the cover the money for example they saw the cover call< call here the stock is trading here then call here the stock is trading here then the< the moment when the stock shoots above the moment when the stock shoots above this< this they get panic right they panic and this they get panic right they panic and what< what they do is they quickly cover their what they do is they quickly cover their cover< cover calls right they buy back the cover calls right they buy back the cover< cover calls for a loss and then only for cover calls for a loss and then only for the< the stock to punch back down the stock to punch back down so< so there's really no need for you to so there's really no need for you to panic< panic if your cover call is in the money panic if your cover call is in the money because< because assignment is not as often as because assignment is not as often as you< you would think so I'm going to give you you would think so I'm going to give you an< an example here so to understand to an example here so to understand to really< really understand whether your cover really understand whether your cover call< call is going to be assigned what we call is going to be assigned what we need< need to do is to put yourself in the need to do is to put yourself in the mindset< mindset of the call buyer right so when mindset of the call buyer right so when you're< you're in the mindset of the person who you're in the mindset of the person who actually< actually buys the call then you would actually buys the call then you would understand< understand whether your cover call is understand whether your cover call is going< going to be assigned or not right so going to be assigned or not right so let's< let's say for example let's say for example we< we are going to sell a cover call at we are going to sell a cover call at this< this place at 135 right let's say we can this place at 135 right let's say we can sell< sell it for a dollar fifty cents so this sell it for a dollar fifty cents so this is< is if we are selling the cover call now is if we are selling the cover call now let's< let's flip the the turn the tables let's flip the the turn the tables around< around let's flip it around and now around let's flip it around and now let's< let's see from the call bias perspective let's see from the call bias perspective all< all right so now we are no longer the all right so now we are no longer the person< person that sold the cover call but person that sold the cover call but right< right now we are the person who bought right now we are the person who bought this< this this call option right so we have this this call option right so we have now< now paid 1. 50 for an out the money call now paid 1.

50 for an out the money call option< option right so the price is here we option right so the price is here we bought< bought this in hopes that the stock bought this in hopes that the stock price< price will just shoot up and then we price will just shoot up and then we will< will make a lot of money on the call will make a lot of money on the call option< option right so here are a few scenarios option right so here are a few scenarios so< so now number one scenario number one is so now number one scenario number one is if< if the stock goes to a hundred and forty if the stock goes to a hundred and forty dollars< dollars right you can see this is now in dollars right you can see this is now in the< the money the cover calls in the money the money the cover calls in the money that< that means our that means our um call< um call option which we bought it's now um call option which we bought it's now in< in the money and it's now going for six in the money and it's now going for six dollars< dollars right so of this six dollars we dollars right so of this six dollars we need< need to understand what's the value what need to understand what's the value what does< does it consist of so in the money does it consist of so in the money options< options always have intrinsic value and options always have intrinsic value and extrinsic< extrinsic value right intrinsic value as extrinsic value right intrinsic value as I've< I've mentioned in many of my previous I've mentioned in many of my previous video< video is just the difference between the video is just the difference between the current< current strike price or the stock price current strike price or the stock price minus< minus of the strike price so the current minus of the strike price so the current stock< stock price is 140 you minus off your stock price is 140 you minus off your strike< strike price at 135 that gives us five strike price at 135 that gives us five dollars< dollars in intrinsic value right and dollars in intrinsic value right and because< because the option is six dollars right because the option is six dollars right so< so there is a dollar in extrinsic value so there is a dollar in extrinsic value all< all right so this makes your call option all right so this makes your call option total< total six dollars right so you bought it total six dollars right so you bought it for< for a dollar fifty cents it's now worth for a dollar fifty cents it's now worth six< six dollars question would you exercise six dollars question would you exercise your< your call option your call option so< so think about it right what's going to so think about it right what's going to happen< happen if you exercise your call option happen if you exercise your call option if< if you exercise your call option it if you exercise your call option it means< means right now you would be buying a means right now you would be buying a hundred< hundred and thirty five dollars the hundred and thirty five dollars the shares< shares 100 shares at 135 dollars right shares 100 shares at 135 dollars right because< because the call options you have the because the call options you have the right< right to buy the underlying stock at right to buy the underlying stock at your< your strike price right so by exercising your strike price right so by exercising your< your option you're trying to you're your option you're trying to you're basically< basically saying that I want to buy the basically saying that I want to buy the shares< shares at 135 when it's now worth 140 shares at 135 when it's now worth 140 right< right so it sounds like you get a profit right so it sounds like you get a. profit right< right it's good because you you you right it's good because you you you exercise< exercise it and you buy at 135 dollars exercise it and you buy at 135 dollars now< now the stock price is 140 you could now the stock price is 140 you could sell< sell it immediately for a profit but the sell it immediately for a profit but the problem< problem is this if you were to exercise problem is this if you were to exercise this< this you get 135 and you sell it this you get 135 and you sell it immediately< immediately in the market for 140 your immediately in the market for 140 your profit< profit is only five dollars right this profit is only five dollars right this is< is the only profit that you get you get is the only profit that you get you get five< five dollars so if you're only going to five dollars so if you're only going to get< get five dollars get five dollars why< why would you want to do that because why would you want to do that because you< you have given up this extrinsic value you have given up this extrinsic value because< because if you had just sold this option because if you had just sold this option by< by itself you would have gotten an by itself you would have gotten an additional< additional Dollar in extrinsic value so additional Dollar in extrinsic value so that< that is an additional 100 but when you that is an additional 100 but when you exercise< exercise it you have totally forego your exercise it you have totally forego your extrinsic< extrinsic value you have forfeited this extrinsic value you have forfeited this extrinsic< extrinsic value so would it make sense extrinsic value so would it make sense for< for you to even exercise your call for you to even exercise your call option< option it doesn't make sense right why option it doesn't make sense right why would< would I exercise my call option when I would I exercise my call option when I can< can just sell away my call option and can just sell away my call option and then< then get six dollars right if I were to then get six dollars right if I were to exercise< exercise I only get five dollars so it exercise I only get five dollars so it doesn't< doesn't make sense you see so if you are doesn't make sense you see so if you are the< the cover call seller and you see that the cover call seller and you see that it's< it's in the money and you notice there's it's in the money and you notice there's still< still one dollar in extrinsic value then still one dollar in extrinsic value then there< there is no incentive for the buyer the there is no incentive for the buyer the person< person who is holding your option this person who is holding your option this cover< cover call to go ahead and exercise cover call to go ahead and exercise because< because they'll be losing out on this because they'll be losing out on this one< one dollar all right so this is the one dollar all right so this is the important< important thing you need to understand important thing you need to understand now< now let's take a look at the next now let's take a look at the next scenario< scenario so the next scenario is that scenario so the next scenario is that what< what if the stock goes to a hundred and what if the stock goes to a hundred and fifty< fifty dollars right so now it really has fifty dollars right so now it really has shut< shut up now uh it is in the money pretty shut up now uh it is in the money pretty deep< deep in the money deep in the money and< and if you were to take a look at the and if you were to take a look at the value< value the call option is now 15. 25 cents value the call option is now 15.

25 cents right< right so of it 15 is intrinsic value and right so of it 15 is intrinsic value and you< you have 25 cents in extrinsic value you have 25 cents in extrinsic value right< right so the option that is 25 each right so the option that is 25 each option< option has 100 shares so the question option has 100 shares so the question again< again is would you exercise your call again is would you exercise your call option option option so< so again if you exercise your call so again if you exercise your call option option option what< what you're going to do is basically what you're going to do is basically you're< you're going to buy 135 if you're going you're going to buy 135 if you're going to< to sell out in the market immediately to sell out in the market immediately you'll< you'll only be making this 15 so again you'll only be making this 15 so again you< you before going this 25 in extrinsic you before going this 25 in extrinsic value< value would you want to do that value would you want to do that well< well some people may say you know they well some people may say you know they want< want to do that because they want to want to do that because they want to hold< hold on to the stock in case the stock hold on to the stock in case the stock will< will go further right if that's the case will go further right if that's the case what< what you could have done is you could what you could have done is you could have< have just sold off this call option for have just sold off this call option for this< this additional 25 which 25 cents right this additional 25 which 25 cents right and< and then just buy the stock again buy and then just buy the stock again buy the< the stock outright at one five zero this the stock outright at one five zero this case< case you still capture this 25 so there case you still capture this 25 so there is< is actually no need for you to exercise is actually no need for you to exercise your< your call option whatsoever all right so your call option whatsoever all right so all< all you have to do all you have to do you< you can just sell off your call right to you can just sell off your call right to make< make the profit so as you can see even make the profit so as you can see even though< though let's say now you are the seller though let's say now you are the seller of< of this cover call of this cover call right< right the cover call is now really deep right the cover call is now really deep in< in the money there's 25 cents left you in the money there's 25 cents left you will< will notice that there is actually no will notice that there is actually no incentive< incentive for the buyer of the option to incentive for the buyer of the option to actually< actually exercise the option because actually exercise the option because they're< they're going to lose out on this 25 they're going to lose out on this 25 cents< cents and if they lose it on this 25 cents and if they lose it on this 25 cents< cents as the option seller you actually cents as the option seller you actually gain< gain this 25 cents you see so that is gain this 25 cents you see so that is why< why there is uh not as high of a chance why there is uh not as high of a chance of< of an assignment as you would think of an assignment as you would think right< right so there's no real need for you to right so there's no real need for you to panic< panic even though if your option goes panic even though if your option goes deep< deep in the money right and there's deep in the money right and there's still< still some time left before expiration still some time left before expiration so< so now what about the third scenario so so now what about the third scenario so now< now this scenario is the same where the now this scenario is the same where the stock< stock goes to 140 but the difference stock goes to 140 but the difference right< right now is that the stock is going to right now is that the stock is going to be< be paying a dividend of 50 cents be paying a dividend of 50 cents tomorrow< tomorrow right so tomorrow you'll be tomorrow right so tomorrow you'll be receiving< receiving uh 50 cents in dividend if you receiving uh 50 cents in dividend if you are< are the uh stockholder so right now are the uh stockholder so right now let's< let's take a look so now you are the let's take a look so now you are the option< option buyer the call option buyer option buyer the call option buyer again< again now your option is worth six again now your option is worth six dollars< dollars you have five dollars in dollars you have five dollars in intrinsic< intrinsic value and you have one dollar intrinsic value and you have one dollar in< in extrinsic value question are you in extrinsic value question are you going< going to exercise your call option now going to exercise your call option now so< so here's what's going to happen if so here's what's going to happen if you're< you're going to exercise if you're going you're going to exercise if you're going to< to exercise let's say you exercise to exercise let's say you exercise you're< you're going to buy 135 dollars all you're going to buy 135 dollars all right< right 100 shares 135 you forego your one right 100 shares 135 you forego your one dollar< dollar extrinsic value you forfeit it so dollar extrinsic value you forfeit it so that< that you can get this 50 cents in that you can get this 50 cents in dividend< dividend right so now you're going to be dividend right so now you're going to be long< long 135 dollars tomorrow you're going long 135 dollars tomorrow you're going to< to receive 50 cents so what you have to receive 50 cents so what you have essentially< essentially Done Right by exercising essentially Done Right by exercising your< your call option as the call option your call option as the call option buyer< buyer is to give up on a dollar just to buyer is to give up on a dollar just to get< get 50 cents get 50 cents does< does that make sense to you does that make sense to you obviously< obviously it doesn't make sense right obviously it doesn't make sense right you're< you're going to be losing out on 50 you're going to be losing out on 50 cents< cents so if in this case what would be a cents so if in this case what would be a better< better option right what would be a better option right what would be a better< better uh choice would be to just sell better uh choice would be to just sell off< off this option for six dollars right off this option for six dollars right because< because if you're going to hold on this because if you're going to hold on this option< option you know that tomorrow they're option you know that tomorrow they're gonna< gonna pay a dividend then your intrinsic gonna pay a dividend then your intrinsic value< value is going to drop by 50 Cents right value is going to drop by 50 Cents right your< your extrinsic value may not necessarily your extrinsic value may not necessarily catch< catch up by 50 Cents so you're going to catch up by 50 Cents so you're going to be< be worse off if you hold on to this be worse off if you hold on to this option< option tomorrow so rather than doing option tomorrow so rather than doing that< that you could just sell off this option that you could just sell off this option today< today and you get this six dollars right today and you get this six dollars right if< if you were to just exercise it you're if you were to just exercise it you're going< going to forego a dollar just to get going to forego a dollar just to get this< this 50 cents it doesn't make sense so this 50 cents it doesn't make sense so that< that is why you see there's no incentive that is why you see there's no incentive for< for the call option buyer to go and for the call option buyer to go and exercise< exercise the option which means if you exercise the option which means if you sold< sold your cover call and you know that sold your cover call and you know that you< you still have a dollar yes extrinsic you still have a dollar yes extrinsic value< value you know that there's a dividend value you know that there's a dividend that's< that's paying 50 cents Tomorrow there's that's paying 50 cents Tomorrow there's no< no real Panic right because it there's no real Panic right because it there's no< no incentive for the call buyer to no incentive for the call buyer to actually< actually exercise the options so that actually exercise the options so that means< means the charge chances of you getting means the charge chances of you getting a< a sign is pretty low right now what a sign is pretty low right now what about< about this scenario the next scenario is about this scenario the next scenario is that< that the stock NOW goes to a hundred and that the stock NOW goes to a hundred and fifty< fifty dollars fifty dollars right< right and they're also going to pay a right and they're also going to pay a dividend< dividend of 50 cents but right now you dividend of 50 cents but right now you notice< notice there's a slight difference notice there's a slight difference because< because your intrinsic value is 15 but because your intrinsic value is 15 but your< your extrinsic value is only 25 cents your extrinsic value is only 25 cents it's< it's only 25 cents now if you are the it's only 25 cents now if you are the call< call option buyer would you exercise call option buyer would you exercise your< your call option so let's think about your call option so let's think about this< this if you're going to exercise your this if you're going to exercise your call< call option you're going to be long a call option you're going to be long a hundred< hundred uh 100 shares at 135 dollars hundred uh 100 shares at 135 dollars you're< you're going to give up this 25 cents you're going to give up this 25 cents and< and then tomorrow you're going to and then tomorrow you're going to receive< receive this 50 cents receive this 50 cents so< so does it make sense for you to so does it make sense for you to exercise exercise exercise yes< yes it makes sense for you to exercise yes it makes sense for you to exercise because< because if you were to exercise and get because if you were to exercise and get shares< shares you will be receiving 25 cents shares you will be receiving 25 cents more< more than what you will get if you just more than what you will get if you just sold< sold off the option right because if you sold off the option right because if you sold< sold out the option you only get to sold out the option you only get to realize< realize 25 cents in extrinsic value but realize 25 cents in extrinsic value but if< if you were to exercise the call option if you were to exercise the call option you'll< you'll get an additional 25 cents which you'll get an additional 25 cents which is< is 25 and you get to hold on to the you is 25 and you get to hold on to the you get< get to along the shares 135 right get to along the shares 135 right so< so this is the only time when it makes so this is the only time when it makes sense< sense for the call option buyer to sense for the call option buyer to exercise< exercise their option so in this case if exercise their option so in this case if you< you are the cover call seller you saw you are the cover call seller you saw the< the cover card this then you know at the cover card this then you know at this< this point in time that there's a good this point in time that there's a good chance< chance for you to get a science so what chance for you to get a science so what do< do you do you obviously do not hold on do you do you obviously do not hold on to< to this cover call and then pray it to this cover call and then pray it doesn't< doesn't get assigned right you can doesn't get assigned right you can always< always do something about it right and always do something about it right and the< the thing you can always do is to just the thing you can always do is to just roll< roll the option out so you get more time roll the option out so you get more time so< so that this extrinsic value get beefed so that this extrinsic value get beefed up< up right this extensive value get up right this extensive value get increased< increased so that it's more than this increased so that it's more than this dividend< dividend right so imagine this if you dividend right so imagine this if you wrote< wrote the cover call right now and let's wrote the cover call right now and let's say< say you roll it to the same strike price say you roll it to the same strike price right< right just example you wrote the same right just example you wrote the same strike< strike price but now your extrinsic strike price but now your extrinsic value< value has increased to a dollar and value has increased to a dollar and there's< there's still like 45 days to expiration there's still like 45 days to expiration now< now as the call option buyer would you now as the call option buyer would you now< now exercise that 45 days option to give now exercise that 45 days option to give up< up one dollar just to get 50 cents it up one dollar just to get 50 cents it doesn't< doesn't make sense right again it doesn't make sense right again it doesn't< doesn't make sense it's very similar to doesn't make sense it's very similar to basically< basically this scenario down here so as basically this scenario down here so as you< you can see the risk of you actually you can see the risk of you actually getting< getting a sign is not as high as you getting a sign is not as high as you think< think now think now with< with that's it how do you avoid early with that's it how do you avoid early assignment< assignment right there's always a chance assignment right there's always a chance to< to get assignment and if you do not want to get assignment and if you do not want to< to face all this uh troubles or rather to face all this uh troubles or rather uh< uh dilemma of whether you should be uh dilemma of whether you should be closing< closing it rolling it or what well there closing it rolling it or what well there are< are a few ways to avoid early assignment are a few ways to avoid early assignment but< but the first thing obviously is not to but the first thing obviously is not to sell< sell cover calls right if you're worried sell cover calls right if you're worried that< that the stock is going to shoot up to that the stock is going to shoot up to the< the Moon then of course there's no point the Moon then of course there's no point for< for you to sell the cover call you're for you to sell the cover call you're only< only going to be limiting yourself and only going to be limiting yourself and giving< giving yourself more stress of not giving yourself more. stress of not wanting< wanting your shares get caught away wanting your shares get caught away right< right so don't sell alcohol that's the right so don't sell alcohol that's the first< first thing number two is to watch my first thing number two is to watch my cover< cover call selection strike selection cover call selection strike selection blueprint< blueprint which I've created blueprint which I've created on< on it where I share with you how to you on it where I share with you how to you know< know choose the strikes which have very know choose the strikes which have very low< low chance of getting a sign right so low chance of getting a sign right so basically< basically you do not want to just sell basically you do not want to just sell cover< cover call every time you only want to cover call every time you only want to choose< choose the times when the market right choose the times when the market right it's< it's really overbought and that's when it's really overbought and that's when you< you can go ahead and sell the cover call you can go ahead and sell the cover call right< right so go ahead and watch this video right so go ahead and watch this video If< If you haven't watched it yet I'll put a If you haven't watched it yet I'll put a link< link somewhere at the top right corner link somewhere at the top right corner of< of this uh video next is to not let your of this uh video next is to not let your let< let your cover call get in the money let your cover call get in the money right< right so that means the moment right so that means the moment the< the stock price reaches your cover call the stock price reaches your cover call strike< strike price let's say you saw a cover strike price let's say you saw a cover call< call down here at the moment the the call down here at the moment the the stock< stock goes up to this point then you stock goes up to this point then you roll< roll your cover call right you roll out roll your cover call right you roll out and< and up and up your< your cover call so this way this your your cover call so this way this your cover< cover call will still be out of the cover call will still be out of the money< money and if the stock continues to go money and if the stock continues to go up< up then you just keep rolling and up then you just keep rolling and rolling< rolling right so this is a very rolling right so this is a very defensive< defensive move if you're really afraid defensive move if you're really afraid of< of getting your shares caught away of getting your shares caught away you're< you're really afraid of your cover card you're really afraid of your cover card getting< getting in the money then you should getting in the money then you should just< just do that just roll again I've just do that just roll again I've created< created a video on how to roll your created a video on how to roll your cover< cover call just go ahead to my channel cover call just go ahead to my channel and< and find that video next thing is that and find that video next thing is that if< if your cover call is already in the if your cover call is already in the money< money right so let's say for example money right so let's say for example this< this is the cover call and right now the this is the cover call and right now the stock< stock is down here what do you do stock is down here what do you do right< right ensure that there's always 21 days right ensure that there's always 21 days in< in expiration right there's 21 DTE left in expiration right there's 21 DTE left in< in your cover call because when there's in your cover call because when there's usually< usually 21 dtes or more the extrinsic usually 21 dtes or more the extrinsic value< value is still there right unless it's value is still there right unless it's really< really really really deep in the money really really really deep in the money right< right but for the most part if there's right but for the most part if there's 21< 21 days and above there should be some 21 days and above there should be some extrinsic< extrinsic value right so it should be extrinsic value right so it should be roughly< roughly this example down here where you roughly this example down here where you know< know you still have 25 cents left and know you still have 25 cents left and you< you know there's no incentive for the you know there's no incentive for the call< call option buyer to exercise at this call option buyer to exercise at this point< point right so just roll it to ensure point right so just roll it to ensure that< that there's more than 21 days to that there's more than 21 days to expiration< expiration then you will have a lesser expiration then you will have a lesser chance< chance of it getting assigned the next chance of it getting assigned the next thing< thing is to avoid dividend paying stocks thing is to avoid dividend paying stocks right< right if you're worried that you're right if you're worried that you're going< going to have dividend risk it's where going to have dividend risk it's where the< the dividend is going to be more than the dividend is going to be more than the< the extrinsic value then of course avoid the extrinsic value then of course avoid dividend< dividend paying stocks right you can dividend paying stocks right you can choose< choose a lot of those growth stocks tax choose a lot of those growth stocks tax stocks< stocks they pay a very little dividends stocks

can simply just buy back< back the stock right if you didn't want back the stock right if you didn't want the< the stock to be called away in the first the stock to be called away in the first place< place right chances are that you think place right chances are that you think that< that the stock is just going to keep that the stock is just going to keep going< going up so there's nothing wrong with going up so there's nothing wrong with just< just buying back the stock again if you just buying back the stock again if you think< think that the stock will really go up think that the stock will really go up in< in the long run right so for example you in the long run right so for example you saw< saw the cover call here saw the cover call here and< and the stock goes up somewhere down and the stock goes up somewhere down here< here right and at this point you got here right and at this point you got caught< caught away your Shares are your Shares caught away your Shares are your

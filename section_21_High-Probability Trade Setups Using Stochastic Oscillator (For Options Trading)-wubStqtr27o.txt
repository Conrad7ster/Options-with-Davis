### High-Probability Trade Setups Using Stochastic Oscillator (For Options Trading)-wubStqtr27o
===============================================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so today's video all right alrighty so today's video we're< we're going to be talking about the we're going to be talking about the stochastic< stochastic oscillator right so i've got stochastic oscillator right so i've got a< a number of requests to cover this a number of requests to cover this stochastic< stochastic oscillator so this video i'm stochastic oscillator so this video i'm going< going to share with you how i use it to going to share with you how i use it to enter< enter into my option trades and also my enter into my option trades and also my settings< settings as well so first off what is settings as well so first off what is the< the stochastic oscillator so without the stochastic oscillator so without getting< getting to all the complex calculation getting to all the complex calculation right< right i'm just going to give you the right i'm just going. to give you the layman< layman terms of what the stochastic layman terms of what the stochastic oscillator< oscillator is it's basically a momentum oscillator is it's basically a momentum indicator< indicator used to identify overbought indicator used to identify overbought and< and oversold conditions in the market and oversold conditions in the market right< right so when the line goes above the 80 right so when the line goes above the 80 mark< mark it's considered overbought and when mark it's considered overbought and when the< the line goes below the 20 mark it is the line goes below the 20 mark it is considered< considered oversold so if you want to considered oversold so if you want to see< see your stochastic see your stochastic oscillator< oscillator you'll see that there are oscillator you'll see that there are these< these two lines right these t lines these two lines right these t lines should< should always be at 80 and 20. so should always be at 80 and 20.

so anything< anything that is above the 80 mark this anything that is above the 80 mark this would< would be considered overbought would be considered overbought all< all right and anything that is below the all right and anything that is below the 20< 20 line right this will be all 20 line right this will be all considered< considered oversold now you notice that considered oversold now you notice that there< there are also two lines down here as there are also two lines down here as well< well so normally the way that they use well so normally the way that they use it< it or the way that is suggested to use it or the way that is suggested to use is< is that when the is that when the faster< faster line in this case is the purple faster line in this case is the purple line< line or the pink line crosses below the line or the pink line crosses below the blue< blue line it means there's some kind of blue line it means there's some kind of indication< indication to sell and if it goes above indication to sell and if it goes above it< it means indication to buy right it means indication to buy right now< now when the reading is overbought it now when the reading is overbought it means< means that there's a likelihood that the means that there's a likelihood that the market< market will go down so in this case market will go down so in this case there's< there's a likelihood or a chance or there's a likelihood or a chance or higher< higher probability that the market will higher probability that the market will go< go down and on the other hand if the go down and on the other hand if the reading< reading is oversold it means that reading is oversold it means that there's< there's a likelihood that the market there's a likelihood that the market will< will go up so will go up so this< this is what you call the overbought and this is what you call the overbought and oversold< oversold uh condition the readings in oversold uh condition the readings in the< the market now one thing to understand the market now one thing to understand is< is that this is not 100 accurate it is that this is not 100 accurate it means< means that it doesn't mean that every means that it doesn't mean that every time< time that the market is overbought the time that the market is overbought the market< market will definitely start to turn and market will definitely start to turn and go< go down right and it doesn't mean that go down right and it doesn't mean that if< if the market is oversold that the if the market is oversold that the market< market will always go back up right this market will always go back up right this is< is just a probability game it's just a is just a probability game it's just a numbers< numbers game there's always a chance numbers game there's always a chance that< that if it's overbought it will con that if it's overbought it will con continue< continue to be overbought and the market continue to be overbought and the market can< can keep just going higher or if it's can keep just going higher or if it's oversold< oversold the market can just keep going oversold the market can just keep going lower< lower so just understand this okay lower so just understand this okay next< next uh this is my settings now the next uh this is my settings now the default< default setting of the stochastic default setting of the stochastic oscillator< oscillator on most platforms is oscillator on most platforms is 1433< 1433 right i like to use 1033 1433 right i like to use 1033 i've< i've been using it for the longest time i've been using it for the longest time and< and i just find that this is better for and i just find that this is better for me< me you know there's not too much me you know there's not too much difference< difference it's just that this gives a difference it's just that this gives a faster< faster reading right you can use the faster reading right you can use the default< default one if you want to default one if you want to right< right so it doesn't really matter that right so it doesn't really matter that much< much now the difference between the much now the difference between the most< most people the way that they use the most people the way that they use the stochastic< stochastic and the way i use it is that stochastic and the way i use it is that i< i remove the percentage k right so i remove the percentage k right so there's< there's a percentage k and the there's a percentage k and the percentage< percentage d remember previously i percentage d remember previously i talked< talked about these two lines now talked about these two lines now percentage< percentage k is the faster line right percentage k is the faster line right you< you can see that it moves uh squiggle you can see that it moves uh squiggle much< much faster than the blue line right so much faster than the blue line right so for< for my purpose i actually do not use the for my purpose i actually do not use the percentage< percentage k actually remove it percentage k actually remove it so< so i only keep the percentage d line and so i only keep the percentage d line and the< the reason is because i use it to the reason is because i use it to identify< identify divergences right so i'll share identify divergences right so i'll share with< with you a little bit about divergence with you a little bit about divergence later< later on but for now you just need to later on but for now you just need to understand< understand that uh for me to uh to understand that uh for me to uh to identify< identify divergence more clearly i do identify divergence more clearly i do not< not use the percentage k line so a good not use the percentage k line so a good way< way for you to remember this is that way for you to remember this is that you< you know d stands for davis you only you know d stands for davis you only want< want to use d because it stands for my want to use d because it stands for my name< name all right so in the uh trading view name all right so in the uh trading view platform< platform you can see this is just platform you can see this is just the< the settings i do right you can just the settings i do right you can just unclick< unclick this box so that the percentage unclick this box so that the percentage k< k doesn't show and everything else you k doesn't show and everything else you can< can just leave as default and and the 10 can just leave as default and and the 10 settings< settings down here settings down here is< is under the percentage k length all is under the percentage k length all right< right so let's get into the entries and right so let's get into the entries and exits< exits now because the stock market tends exits now because the stock market tends to< to go up over the long term right i only to go up over the long term right i only use< use the stochastic oscillator to find use the stochastic oscillator to find bullish< bullish entries right the way i enter bullish entries right the way i enter into< into the market is much more medium to into the market is much more medium to long< long term where i can keep the trade on long term where i can keep the trade on for< for months for months even< even sometime years depending on even sometime years depending on how< how bullish i am on the certain stock or how bullish i am on the certain stock or the the the the< the the etf but generally i just. keep it the the etf but generally i just keep it long< long term i do not really long term i do not really re-enter re-enter re-enter into< into the market unless i see that into the market unless i see that there's< there's a need to right so the entry there's a need to right so the entry tactics< tactics there are three of them so the tactics there are three of them so the first< first off is i will look for oversold first off is i will look for oversold near< near a support level entry tactic number near a support level entry tactic number two< two is to find bullish divergence and two is to find bullish divergence and entry< entry tactic number three is to find entry tactic number three is to find hidden< hidden bullish divergence and i'll go hidden bullish divergence and i'll go more< more into it later on more into it later on so< so what are the option entry strategies so what are the option entry strategies that< that you can use now there are a number that you can use now there are a number of< of which i use right you can use the of which i use right you can use the call< call libs so this is when i have a very call libs so this is when i have a very long< long term view and i really love to use long term view and i really love to use this< this on indexed etfs like the qqqs iwms this on indexed etfs like the qqqs iwms right< right because right because most< most of the time the extrinsic value is most of the time the extrinsic value is not< not as high as compared to individual not as high as compared to individual stocks< stocks and you have really far out stocks and you have really far out expiration< expiration dates right so i like to use expiration dates right so i like to use it< it uh using a college or index etfs next it uh using a college or index etfs next is< is to use a cash output as well cash is to use a cash output as well cash output< output is to enter into stocks i have a output is to enter into stocks i have a video< video all about it in my channel you can video all about it in my channel you can go< go ahead and take a look at it go ahead and take a look at it next< next will be blue call spread this is next will be blue call spread this is when< when i'm a little bit more speculative when i'm a little bit more speculative for< for the short term where i want to hold for the short term where i want to hold it< it for you know anywhere from 30 to 60 it for you know anywhere from 30 to 60 days< days and then you have the poor man's days and then you have the poor man's cover< cover call so the promise cover call is cover call so the promise cover call is basically< basically just the long call option all basically just the long call option all right< right in this case i will use the long right in this case i will use the long call< call leaps and sell a short call against call leaps and sell a short call against it< it which is covered call all right it which is covered call all right now now now the< the next thing is for exits i tend to the next thing is for exits i tend to keep< keep things simple and i only look to keep things simple and i only look to exit< exit my position when the market is exit my position when the market is oversold< oversold right so i only look for oversold right so i only look for oversold< oversold i do not i do not try to oversold i do not i do not try to look< look for the opposite of all these look for the opposite of all these diversions< diversions right i just keep things very diversions right i just keep things very simple< simple because in the mark in the long simple because in the mark in the long term< term the market wants to keep going up term the market wants to keep going up right< right so i always have a right so i always have a much< much more bullish view than i have uh much more bullish view than i have uh instead< instead instead of being bearish right instead instead of being bearish right all< all right so bullish entry tactic number all right so bullish entry tactic number one< one look for oversold conditions near a one look for oversold conditions near a support< support area or a previous low right so support area or a previous low right so what< what i'm really looking for is for the what i'm really looking for is for the stochastics stochastics stochastics to< to have this oversold reading and that to have this oversold reading and that this< this uh this uh price< price movement needs to find a support price movement needs to find a support right< right so i want to find this support right so i want to find this support down< down here a previous low down here a previous low that< that it breaks it and then i have an that it breaks it and then i have an oversold< oversold area all right so let's take a oversold area all right so let's take a look< look at some trade examples look at some trade examples all< all right so this is of the iwm right all right so this is of the iwm right this< this is on the daily chart now most of this is on the daily chart now most of the< the time i only use the stochastics on the time i only use the stochastics on the< the daily chart because i find that it's the daily chart because i find that it's slightly< slightly more accurate than you were to slightly more accurate than you were to do< do it on intraday so i do not really do it on intraday so i do not really trade< trade in today at all trade in today at all so< so it's mostly just daily trades alright so it's mostly just daily trades alright so< so you can see there are two oversold so you can see there are two oversold readings< readings down here all right readings down here all right but< but the one we are going for would be but the one we are going for would be this< this and the reason is because of the this and the reason is because of the support< support area right so we don't want an support area right so we don't want an oversold< oversold reading just on its own we want oversold reading just on its own we want an< an oversold reading that ties in with a an oversold reading that ties in with a support< support area of a previous low so you support area of a previous low so you can< can see this is a previous low right can see this is a previous low right once< once it breaks low you can see this once it breaks low you can see this oversold< oversold so at this point of time you oversold so at this point of time you can< can enter uh the different option trades can enter uh the different option trades that< that you want right you can enter into a that you want right you can enter into a call< call leap call leap a< a long call leap option down here or you a long call leap option down here or you can< can sell a cash account put somewhere can sell a cash account put somewhere below< below let's say if the price is around below let's say if the price is around 164< 164 you see that there's an oversold 164 you see that there's an oversold reading< reading you could sell maybe the 20 reading you could sell maybe the 20 deltas< deltas right or go somewhere around 1. 50 deltas right or go somewhere around 1.

50 based< based on where you feel you would like based on where you feel you would like to< to own 100 shares off right to own 100 shares off right or< or if you're a little bit more or if you're a little bit more speculative< speculative you can enter a boot call speculative you can enter a boot call spread< spread right you can buy a long call and spread right you can buy a long call and then< then you can sell then you can sell a< a call option down here right that's a a call option down here right that's a boot< boot call spread or a poor man's cover boot call spread or a poor man's cover call< call as well call as well all< all right so there are a lot of all right so there are a lot of different< different ways you can enter into the different ways you can enter into the market< market right market right now< now next now next visa visa visa so< so can you identify where are the places so can you identify where are the places where where where you< you could enter into a bullish trade you could enter into a bullish trade so< so there are a few you can see that down so there are a few you can see that down here< here as well this it broke the previous here as well this it broke the previous low< low right this broke the previous low low right this broke the previous low down< down here we draw a support area the down here we draw a support area the market< market broke down and then it's oversold market broke down and then it's oversold you< you notice there's another oversold down you notice there's another oversold down here here here it< it coincides with this but there's no it coincides with this but there's no real< real support area no previous low down real support area no previous low down here< here so we don't want to enter into this here so we don't want to enter into this because< because this will be considered one of because this will be considered one of those< those false reading right if you enter those false reading right if you enter into< into it the market is going to just drop into it the market is going to just drop right< right same thing down here you can see right same thing down here you can see there's< there's an over soap there's an over soap this< this oversold it went up momentarily this oversold it went up momentarily before< before it dropped down again but there's before it dropped down again but there's no< no real previous low no real previous low that< that it broke there's no support area so that it broke there's no support area so we< we always want to couple this with a we always want to couple this with a support< support to give us a higher probability support to give us a higher probability of< of the market going back up later on of the market going back up later on all< all right so from down here you can see all right so from down here you can see that< that this is the previous low right you that this is the previous low right you draw< draw a line across a an area across so draw a line across a an area across so that< that you know where the support is and that you know where the support is and you< you can see that in both instances you can see that in both instances whenever< whenever there is an oversold reading whenever there is an oversold reading the< the market subsequently bounced up right the market subsequently bounced up right all< all right let's get into one more all right let's get into one more example< example so this is in sort of a sideways example so this is in sort of a sideways moving< moving trend right the market is just moving trend right the market is just moving< moving sideways in the channel so can moving sideways in the channel so can you< you identify where would be you identify where would be possible< possible areas where you can enter into possible areas where you can enter into trade trade trade all< all right down here you see this is the all right down here you see this is the support< support previous low all right it broke support previous low all right it broke the< the previous low the previous low and< and then oversold reading all right and then oversold reading all right market< market went up right this time it took market went up right this time it took quite< quite a while before it finally moved up quite a while before it finally moved up down< down here as well down here as well okay< okay so it bounced off the previous low okay so it bounced off the previous low area< area all right previous low it came up area all right previous low it came up with< with an oversold reading and then the with an oversold reading and then the market< market subsequently kept up on very good market subsequently kept up on very good earnings earnings earnings all< all right so that is uh for the oversold all right so that is uh for the oversold now< now bullish entry tactic number two is now bullish entry tactic number two is bullish< bullish divergence all right so this is bullish divergence all right so this is where< where you want to ingrain your mind with where you want to ingrain your mind with this< this pattern that i'm showing here right this pattern that i'm showing here right here here here so< so bullish divergence usually is a so bullish divergence usually is a reversal< reversal right so it's a pattern right reversal right so it's a pattern right where< where the market is forming lower lows where the market is forming lower lows or< or a double bottom but the stochastic or a double bottom but the stochastic oscillator< oscillator is showing a higher low so oscillator is showing a higher low so you< you can see down here this is the waves you can see down here this is the waves of< of the the pattern of the market of the the pattern of the market all< all right you can see that it's forming all right you can see that it's forming lower< lower lows but then the stochastic lower lows but then the stochastic oscillator< oscillator is forming higher lows so oscillator is forming higher lows so what< what you call this is a divergence so what you call this is a divergence so this< this is a bullish divergence indicating this is a bullish divergence indicating that< that there's a higher likelihood that that there's a higher likelihood that the< the market will go up than it going down the market will go up than it going down so< so this is the bullish divergence when so this is the bullish divergence when the< the market is in an uptrend right this the market is in an uptrend right this rarely< rarely happens i've only seen it only a rarely happens i've only seen it only a number< number of times especially on a daily number of times especially on a daily chart chart chart this< this happens more frequently right but this happens more frequently right but it< it does happen as well on the when the it does happen as well on the when the market< market is in the uptrend so so when the market is in the uptrend so so when the market< market is an uptrend you you will see market is an uptrend you you will see that< that sometimes it also forms this that sometimes it also forms this intermediate< intermediate low low right you can see intermediate low low right you can see that that that there's< there's a lower low here and then the there's a lower low here and then the stochastic< stochastic indicator right is showing a stochastic indicator right is showing a higher< higher low so in this case higher low so in this case uh< uh this is also a bullish uh divergence uh this is also a bullish uh divergence all< all right so let's take a look at some all right so let's take a look at some example example example all< all right so the first example uh qqqs all right so the first example uh qqqs all< all right can you find places where all right can you find places where there< there is a bullish divergence there is a bullish divergence okay< okay so okay so the< the first one is this as you can see the the first one is this as you can see the market< market is forming kind of like a double market is forming kind of like a double bottom< bottom right bottom right right< right so it couldn't break the previous right so it couldn't break the previous low< low down here low down here but< but you can see that the stochastics but you can see that the stochastics right< right it's forming a higher low so this right it's forming a higher low so this is< is a bullish divergence so it went up is a bullish divergence so it went up subsequently< subsequently above here so depending on subsequently above here so depending on what< what is the option trade that you have what is the option trade that you have right< right so maybe you have a cash account right so maybe you have a cash account put< put down here put down here so< so if you sell a cash account put so if you sell a cash account put right< right once the market goes to an over right once the market goes to an over sold< sold reading you could take off the sold reading you could take off the trade< trade right or you could buy maybe the trade right or you could buy maybe the boot< boot call spread right you could maybe boot call spread right you could maybe buy< buy a long call here sell buy a long call here sell another< another call down here right long call a another call down here right long call a short< short call you get a vertical spread short call you get a vertical spread once< once it's oversold you can take the once it's oversold you can take the whole< whole position off as well so as you can whole position off as well so as you can see< see there's really a number of ways that see there's really a number of ways that you< you can enter into the market you can enter into the market so< so this is the second uh bullish so this is the second uh bullish divergence< divergence right you can see the market divergence right you can see the market is< is making low lows right it broke the is making low lows right it broke the previous< previous low down here previous low down here and< and then there is a divergence right you and then there is a divergence right you can< can see that the stochastic is forming can see that the stochastic is forming higher< higher lows instead all right then the higher lows instead all right then the market< market although it went down right went market although it went down right went up< up went down it subsequently went all up went down it subsequently went all the< the way back up again so sometime it can the way back up again so sometime it can be< right< right now this is the third example right now this is the third example or< or rather the second example so let's or rather the second example so let's take< so< so can you identify the bullish so can you identify the bullish divergence< divergence here divergence here all< all right if you spot spotted this well all right if you spot spotted this well then< then good job because you can see that then good job because you can see that the< the market tried to form a lower low as the market tried to form a lower low as well< well right went up went down well right went up went down all< all right and then you can see that the all right and then you can see that the stochastic< stochastic oscillator forming a higher stochastic oscillator forming a higher low low low all< all right down here can you identify all right down here can you identify where< where the bullish divergence is this is where the bullish divergence is this is when< when the market is in an uptrend so this when the market is in an uptrend so this is< is amazon is amazon all< all right if you identify this again all right if you identify this again well< well done so you can see that the market well done so you can see that the market is< is forming lower lows but then the is forming lower lows but then the stochastic< stochastic oscillator is forming higher stochastic oscillator is forming higher low< low so this as you can see is the low so this as you can see is the bullish< bullish divergence and the market goes bullish divergence and the market goes out< out and one thing that is good is that out and one thing that is good is that if< if it's in an uptrend if you can bounce if it's in an uptrend if you can bounce off< off a moving average there will be even off a moving average there will be even more< more uh uh better in terms of more uh uh better in terms of confirmation< confirmation because there are times confirmation because there are times where< where the moving average will be just where the moving average will be just nice< nice cradling the price right so the nice cradling the price right so the dynamic< dynamic i mean the moving average can dynamic i mean the moving average can also< also serve as a dynamic support right also serve as a dynamic support right dominic< dominic support dynamic resistance so if dominic support dynamic resistance so if the< the price was to bounce off the the the price was to bounce off the the moving< moving average and then you get your moving average and then you get your bullish< bullish divergence at the same time then bullish divergence at the same time then it< it will be a it will be a a< a very nice confirmation that the market a very nice confirmation that the market has< has a strong likelihood of it going up has a strong likelihood of it going up then< then it going back down all right then it going back down all right bullish< bullish entry tactic number three is bullish entry tactic number three is hidden< hidden bullish divergence so hidden hidden bullish divergence so hidden bullish< bullish divergence is the opposite of bullish divergence is the opposite of the< the regular divergence which i showed the regular divergence which i showed you< you earlier so this is when the market you earlier. so this is when the market right< right is forming higher lows but then right is forming higher lows but then the< the stochastic oscillator is forming the stochastic oscillator is forming lower< lower lows now normally when the market lower lows now normally when the market is< is forming higher lows the stochastic is forming higher lows the stochastic should< should also form higher lows right so should also form higher lows right so let< let me show you an example down here you let me show you an example down here you can< can see that as it goes up you can see can see that as it goes up you can see that< that it's actually forming that it's actually forming higher< higher lows all these are all forming higher lows all these are all forming higher< higher lows so this is how the it should higher lows so this is how the it should be< be right but when there is a hidden be right but when there is a hidden bullish< bullish divergence you'll notice that bullish divergence you'll notice that the< the stochastic oscillator is actually the stochastic oscillator is actually forming< forming lower lows so this actually can forming lower lows so this actually can provide< provide a pretty good opportunity to provide a pretty good opportunity to enter< enter into a long trade enter into a long trade right< right so this is in an uptrend and in a right so this is in an uptrend and in a downtrend< downtrend similar right you will see downtrend similar right you will see that< that the market right will be forming that the market right will be forming these< these higher lows but then the these higher lows but then the stochastic< stochastic oscillator will be forming stochastic oscillator will be forming this< this lower lows all right let's take a this lower lows all right let's take a look< look at some trade examples look at some trade examples right< right so can you identify where the right so can you identify where the hidden< hidden divergence is on this chart for hidden divergence is on this chart for starbucks starbucks starbucks all< all right so it's over here you can see all right so it's over here you can see that< that the market is forming high lows that the market is forming high lows right< right the market is generally going up right the market is generally going up but< but then there is a very obvious but then there is a very obvious low< low low low low in< in the in the stochastics< stochastics so as you can see the moment stochastics so as you can see the moment at< at this point of time it also coincides at this point of time it also coincides with< with the market being oversold right with the market being oversold right sometimes< sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't but< but that's that's not important right but that's that's not important right what's< what's important is that it actually what's important is that it actually forms< forms this lower low these two forms this lower low these two valleys< valleys down here that is lower than valleys down here that is lower than this< this two all right so you can see that this two all right so you can see that after< after this happens the market goes up after this happens the market goes up all< all right let's take a look at another all right let's take a look at another example example example right< right so can you identify the hidden right so can you identify the hidden bullish< bullish divergence here all right just bullish divergence here all right just pause< pause the video if you have to pause the video if you have to all< all right so it's here so the market is all right so it's here so the market is going< going up right again forming higher lows going up right again forming higher lows but< but then the stochastic is forming lower but then the stochastic is forming lower lows< lows and soon after although the market lows and soon after although the market just< just bounced up and down for a while just bounced up and down for a while eventually< eventually went back up eventually went back up all< all right all right another< another example this is the last example another example this is the last example this< this is on apple you can see the market this is on apple you can see the market is< is in an upward trend can you find where is in an upward trend can you find where the< the hidden bullish divergence is the hidden bullish divergence is all< all right so as you can see the market all right so as you can see the market is< is generally going upwards right forming is generally going upwards right forming this< this higher lows this higher lows all< all right down here and down here as all right down here and down here as well< well compared to this and you can see well compared to this and you can see that< that the stochastics is actually forming that the stochastics is actually forming lower< lower lows right so you have higher lows lower lows right so you have higher lows and< and lower lows and the market costs and lower lows and the market costs subsequently< subsequently when higher all right so subsequently when higher all right so what< what about exit tactics right so what about exit tactics right so basically< basically exit tactic as mentioned i basically exit tactic as mentioned i like< like to keep things simple and only take like to keep things simple and only take action< action when the market is overbought all action when the market is overbought all right< right so if i'm in a profit and the right so if i'm in a profit and the market< market is overbought there are three market is overbought there are three options< options that i'll do first is i would options that i'll do first is i would sell< sell the cover call if i don't have a sell the cover call if i don't have a covered< covered call right i may have 100 shares covered call right i may have 100 shares or< or i have a long call right so this is or i have a long call right so this is time< time where i'll enter into a covered time where i'll enter into a covered call< call position call position right< right if i already have a cover call right if i already have a cover call if< if the cover call is in the money then i if the cover call is in the money then i could< could consider rolling the cover call could consider rolling the cover call right< right i'll roll it out and up right i'll roll it out and up and< and if i decide that you know it's time and if i decide that you know it's time for< for me to close the position if i cannot for me to close the position if i cannot roll< roll the cover call anymore if i already roll the cover call anymore if i already have< have one right then i'll just simply have one right then i'll just simply close< close out the whole position so it's close out the whole position so it's pretty< pretty simple when it comes to exiting pretty simple when it comes to exiting right< right but if i'm in a loss then most of right but if i'm in a loss then most of the< the time because the the rationale of me the time because the the rationale of me entering< entering into a trade in the first place entering into a trade in the first place is< is generally a long-term view i is generally a long-term view i generally< generally tend to just hold on to it generally tend to just hold on to it right right right so< so a lot of this i tend to use it as a so a lot of this i tend to use it as a investment< investment options investment so if i investment options investment so if i have< have a call leap i tend to just hold on have a call leap i tend to just hold on to< to it especially right now when the to it especially right now when the market< market is dropping i just hold on to the market is dropping i just hold on to the leaps< leaps right if it goes uh closer to my leaps right if it goes uh closer to my expiration< expiration date i can choose to roll it expiration date i can choose to roll it and< and if i have a cover call again do and if i have a cover call again do nothing< nothing or i can just be aggressive and nothing or i can just be aggressive and roll< roll the cover call down if a cash roll the cover call down if a cash output< output i just let it assign if it's in output i just let it assign if it's in the< the money right i can just let it expire the money right i can just let it expire in< in the money i get the long shares and i in the money i get the long shares and i get< get a long shares the market goes back get a long shares the market goes back up< up again becomes overbought and i can up again becomes overbought and i can sell< sell a cover call i'll sell a couple sell a cover call i'll sell a couple call< call there but if for a blue call spread call there but if for a blue call spread because< because the blue call spread is because the blue call spread is basically< basically a speculative trade more in basically a speculative trade more in the< the short term so i'll basically just the short term so i'll basically just close< close it up once i reach 50 of the max close it up once i reach 50 of the max loss< loss right so if i risk a thousand loss right so if i risk a thousand dollars< dollars on the trade once it reaches dollars on the trade once it reaches around< around 500 loss i'll just close out the around 500 loss i'll just close out the position position position all< all right let's have some takeaways so all right let's have some takeaways so the< the stochastic oscillator is a great the stochastic oscillator is a great tool< tool to identify overbought and oversold tool to identify overbought and oversold condition condition condition right< right it is not 100 accurate this is right it is not 100 accurate this is very< very important to understand right a lot very important to understand right a lot of< of people will put all their money into of people will put all their money into that< that one trade uh whenever there is a that one trade uh whenever there is a very< very extreme oversight condition right very extreme oversight condition right this< this is not what you want to do you this is not what you want to do you still< still want to have proper money still want to have proper money management< management and just put a certain management and just put a certain percentage< percentage of your account on each trade percentage of your account on each trade all< all right so in case if you're wrong you all right so in case if you're wrong you still< still can survive for the next trade still can survive for the next trade again again again so so so what< what the stochastic oscillator does is what the stochastic oscillator does is that< that it gives an indication that the that it gives an indication that the market< market has a higher probability of market has a higher probability of turning< turning when the market is overbought or turning when the market is overbought or is< is oversold now next the stochastic is oversold now next the stochastic oscillator< oscillator can also be used to identify oscillator can also be used to identify divergence< divergence right there are two types of divergence right there are two types of diversions< diversions you have the regular bullish diversions you have the regular bullish divergence< divergence that is when the market is divergence that is when the market is forming< forming lower low wave patterns but the forming lower low wave patterns but the stochastic< stochastic is showing a higher low wave stochastic is showing a higher low wave pattern< pattern then you have the hidden bullish pattern then you have the hidden bullish diversions< diversions where the market is forming diversions where the market is forming higher< higher low wave patterns but the higher low wave patterns but the stochastic< stochastic is showing a lower low wave stochastic is showing a lower low wave pattern pattern pattern and< and there are a few option strategies and there are a few option strategies that< that you can use when there is a bullish that you can use when there is a bullish signal< signal right you have the college when signal right you have the college when you< you have a very long term bullish view you have a very long term bullish view you< you can use the cash secure output for you can use the cash secure output for uh< uh prices or areas where you want to get uh prices or areas where you want to get long< long 100 shares when you get long 100 long 100 shares when you get long 100 shares< shares of underlying stock and then you shares of underlying stock and then you can< can get into a blue call spread for a can get into a blue call spread for a more< more speculative short-term trend more speculative short-term trend anywhere< anywhere from 30 to 60 days and then you anywhere from 30 to 60 days and then you have< have the poor man's covered call as well have the poor man's covered call as well and< and if the position is in profit and the and if the position is in profit and the market< market is overbought basically you sell market is overbought basically you sell the< the cover call right you can choose to the cover call right you can choose to sell< sell the covered call you can choose to sell the covered call you can choose to roll< roll the cover call or you can just roll the cover call or you can just choose< choose the closed position as a whole choose the closed position as a whole all< all right guys so i hope you like this all right guys so i hope you like this video< video and you found this video useful if

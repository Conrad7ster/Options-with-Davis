Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you one I'm going to be sharing with you one simple< simple change that you can do to become simple change that you can do to become a< a profitable options Trader so what is a profitable options Trader so what is this< this one simple change well this one this one simple change well this one simple< simple change is basically to use the simple change is basically to use the exit< exit at 21 DTE rule right so you have exit at 21 DTE rule right so you have probably< probably heard about this in quite a probably heard about this in quite a number< number of my videos but I'm going to go number of my videos but I'm going to go very< very much in depth in this video as well very much in depth in this video as well as< as to show you some studies as well as as to show you some studies as well as statistics< statistics as to to why 21 DTE exiting a statistics as to to why 21 DTE exiting a 21< 21 DTE more specifically can help you 21 DTE more specifically can help you get< get a much better performance in options get a much better performance in options trading< trading so what exactly is 21 DTE first trading so what exactly is 21 DTE first of< of all right just to make things clear of all right just to make things clear because< because some people actually get because some people actually get confused< confused so 21 DTE just means that there confused so 21 DTE just means that there is< is 21 days left to the expiration of the is 21 days left to the expiration of the option< option right it doesn't mean that you option right it doesn't mean that you have< have 21 days in a trade right it's not have 21 days in a trade right it's not there< there it's 21 days left before the there it's 21 days left before the options< options expire so it's like a countdown options expire so it's like a countdown so< so to speak so to use this exit at 21 so to speak so to use this exit at 21 DTE< DTE rule there are some conditions so DTE rule there are some conditions so the< the very first condition is that you the very first condition is that you want< want to enter the trade at around 45 DTE want to enter the trade at around 45 DTE right< right so the 45 DTE options and then right so the 45 DTE options and then exit< exit at 21 DTE at the latest even if exit at 21 DTE at the latest even if it's< it's a loss right some people think that it's a loss right some people think that only< only if it's a profit you exit no only if it's a profit you exit no whether< whether it's a loss or a profit you want whether it's a loss or a profit you want to< to exit it right because when you do it to exit it right because when you do it this< this way you're going to have much this way you're going to have much better< better performance in the long term so better performance in the long term so I'm< I'm going to share with you some studies I'm going to share with you some studies to< to support this as well so you might be to support this as well so you might be wondering< wondering Davis why 45 DTE right well wondering Davis why 45 DTE right well the< the reason for 45 DTE uh really is done the reason for 45 DTE uh really is done by< by this tasty trade research team what by this tasty trade research team what they< they found is that when you go for they found is that when you go for options< options around the 45 DTE Mark that options around the 45 DTE Mark that means< means when you enter uh your trade at means when you enter uh your trade at around< around 45 DTE what they found out is around 45 DTE what they found out is that< that you have an edge in the long term that you have an edge in the long term right< right so basically the realized move is right so basically the realized move is most< most often the time lesser than the most often the time lesser than the expected< expected move now I've already gone into expected move now I've already gone into this< this very much in depth in another video this very much in depth in another video called< called the number one secret to becoming called the number one secret to becoming consistently< consistently profitable uh you can go to consistently profitable uh you can go to my< my channel just to watch that for this my channel just to watch that for this video< video I won't go into detail but what video I won't go into detail but what you< you need to know is that when we use the you need to know is that when we use the exit< exit at 21 DTE rule it only applies if exit at 21 DTE rule it only applies if you< you enter around 45 days or so right you enter around 45 days or so right days< days to expiration you do not want to days to expiration you do not want to use< use like 30 DTE because if you use 30 use like 30 DTE because if you use 30 DTE< DTE and you exit at 21 DTE there's only DTE and you exit at 21 DTE there's only 9< 9 days in the trade right it's just two 9 days in the trade right it's just two short< short so the right amount of time short so the right amount of time according< according to the tasty trade research according to the tasty trade research team< team is 45 DTE now you might be also team is 45 DTE now you might be also asking< asking but Davis uh does it have to asking but Davis uh does it have to exactly< exactly be 45 DTE what if I cannot find exactly be 45 DTE what if I cannot find you< you know this DTE on the option chain you know this DTE on the option chain what< what if there's only the 50 DTE or maybe what if there's only the 50 DTE or maybe only< only the 60 plus DTE well in my opinion only the 60 plus DTE well in my opinion I< I think that's fine as well right it's I think that's fine as well right it's not< not too far off as long as you don't go not too far off as long as you don't go so< so far off like 100 over days on the so far off like 100 over days on the other< other end you also don't want to go too other end you also don't want to go too low< low right if you go something like 42 low right if you go something like 42 DTE< DTE I think that's fine as well but DTE I think that's fine as well but don't< don't go all the way to like 30 DTE don't go all the way to like 30 DTE because< because then it really wouldn't make because then it really wouldn't make sense< sense if you're going to exit at 21 DTE sense if you're going to exit at 21 DTE so< so now that we have gotten that out of so now that we have gotten that out of the< the way how do you actually know if it's the way how do you actually know if it's 21< 21 DTE on your option chain or on your 21 DTE on your option chain or on your platform< platform right so for the most part your platform right so for the most part your trading< trading platform should already show how trading platform should already show how many< many days there is left in your position many days there is left in your position right< right so for example this is using the right so for example this is using the tasty< tasty trade platform so as you can see tasty trade platform so as you can see down< down here when you have a position on on down here when you have a position on on the< the right hand side it will already show the right hand side it will already show you< you how many days there is left to the you how many days there is left to the expression< expression so this number down here it expression so this number down here it says< says 38 days right 38D this does not says 38 days right 38D this does not mean< mean that you are in the trade for 38 mean that you are in the trade for 38 days< days no this just means there's 38 days days no this just means there's 38 days left< left to the expiration of this option left to the expiration of this option so< so what you're looking out for is for so what you're looking out for is for this< this number to drop to this number to drop to 21d< 21d and then this is where you exit the 21d and then this is where you exit the trade< trade right this is where it's at the 21 trade right this is where it's at the 21 DTE< DTE Mark so different platforms have DTE Mark so different platforms have different< different ways of seeing this DTE so different ways of seeing this DTE so it's< it's best to check with your broker to it's best to check with your broker to find< find out how you can see this DTE now find out how you can see this DTE now next< next you can also exit at a fixed next you can also exit at a fixed takeprofit< takeprofit or 21 DTE whichever comes takeprofit or 21 DTE whichever comes first< first right so you do not have to wait first right so you do not have to wait all< all the way to 21 DTE just uh Alone by all the way to 21 DTE just uh Alone by that< that you can also exit at a fixed take that you can also exit at a fixed take profit< profit let's say for example 50% take profit let's say for example 50% take profit< profit so in this way once it reaches profit so in this way once it reaches 50%< 50% take profit you can exit the trade 50% take profit you can exit the trade. right< right you don't have to wait until 21 right you don't have to wait until 21 DTE< DTE but if it doesn't reaches 50% take DTE but if it doesn't reaches 50% take profit< profit then once it's 21 DD you just profit then once it's 21 DD you just close< close the trade right so the tasty trade close the trade right so the tasty trade team< team have also done quite a number of team have also done quite a number of research< research and they found that this also research and they found that this also gives< gives you pretty good results now next gives you pretty good results now next this< this is only applicable to the following this is only applicable to the following nons< nons slope option strategies and you nons slope option strategies and you don't< don't intend to get assign so what I don't intend to get assign so what I mean< mean by nons slow option strategies so mean by nons slow option strategies so basically< basically when I say slow option spreads basically when I say slow option spreads or< or strategies what I really mean is or strategies what I really mean is strategies< strategies like the butterfly or the strategies like the butterfly or the ratio< ratio spreads right because this ratio spreads right because this strategies< strategies actually take a very long strategies actually take a very long time< time for you to actually reach the p&amp;l time for you to actually reach the p&amp;l graph< graph at expiration so whenever you put graph at expiration so whenever you put on< on the butterfly it will look something on the butterfly it will look something like< like this right so this is the butterfly like this right so this is the butterfly so< so this graph down here right it's the so this graph down here right it's the p&amp;l< p&amp;l at expiration but once you put it on p&amp;l at expiration but once you put it on this< this is actually not your p&amp;l just yet this is actually not your p&amp;l just yet right< right you will see another line a right you will see another line a different< different colored line so in this case different colored line so in this case I'll< I'll put a dotted line as to where it I'll put a dotted line as to where it should< should be when you first put it on should be when you first put it on something< something like this right so over time something like this right so over time this< this dotted line will move up to this uh this dotted line will move up to this uh solid< solid line and eventually it becomes solid line and eventually it becomes dead< dead at expiration but at 21 DTE it dead at expiration but at 21 DTE it actually< actually doesn't reach this Mark that actually doesn't reach this Mark that quickly< quickly right in fact in might somewhere quickly right in fact in might somewhere be< be around here only right you will see be around here only right you will see that< that there's not much change so there's that there's not much change so there's actually< actually not much profit to be made actually not much profit to be made based< based on this kind of slow spreads based on this kind of slow spreads whereas< whereas if you compare it to maybe the whereas if you compare it to maybe the iron< iron Condor the iron Condor you actually iron Condor the iron Condor you actually see< see that at 21 DTE you actually have a see that at 21 DTE you actually have a higher< higher profit line right so this is the higher profit line right so this is the ion< ion Condor so again at 21 DTE maybe it ion Condor so again at 21 DTE maybe it will< will look something like this right will look something like this right something< something like this so it's going to something like this so it's going to much< much closer to where the exploration much closer to where the exploration line< line is compared to the butterfly so the line is compared to the butterfly so the butterfly< butterfly these are slow spreads we butterfly these are slow spreads we don't< don't apply the 21 DT at least that's my don't apply the 21 DT at least that's my experience< experience and also we do not want to experience and also we do not want to use< use it on the wheel strategy right use it on the wheel strategy right because< because with the wheel strategy we because with the wheel strategy we actually< actually want to get ass signed right if actually want to get ass signed right if we< we want to get ass signed then there's we want to get ass signed then there's no< no point to exit at 21 DTE so for the no point to exit at 21 DTE so for the wheel< wheel strategy so basically the cash SEC wheel strategy so basically the cash SEC put< put and the cover call this also won't put and the cover call this also won't really< really apply right unless of course you really apply right unless of course you do< do want to roll then rolling will be at do want to roll then rolling will be at 21< 21 DT as well but that's a whole 21 DT as well but that's a whole different< different topic so for now let us focus different topic so for now let us focus on< on just this few strategies mainly these on just this few strategies mainly these few< few strategies also because the TC trade few strategies also because the TC trade team< team have most of their studies done on team have most of their studies done on this< this few strategy so this is going to be this few strategy so this is going to be the< the focus of this exit at 21 DTE rule so the focus of this exit at 21 DTE rule so you< you might be wondering at this point why you might be wondering at this point why do< do we want to exit at 21 DT why not just do we want to exit at 21 DT why not just hold< hold all the way to expiration well hold all the way to expiration well there< there are three good reasons for this there are three good reasons for this this< this so the very first reason is that this so the very first reason is that exit< exit at 21 DTE reduces your max loss so exit at 21 DTE reduces your max loss so I'm< I'm going to share with you quite a I'm going to share with you quite a number< number of studies throughout the rest of number of studies throughout the rest of this< this video so really pay attention here this video so really pay attention here because< because it's very important for you to because it's very important for you to understand< understand so first of all you can see understand so first of all you can see over< over here this is a study done by the over here this is a study done by the tasty< tasty trade team as well where they tasty trade team as well where they compare< compare the undefined R strategy if I'm compare the undefined R strategy if I'm not< not mistaken I think it's the strangle not mistaken I think it's the strangle right< right so you notice what they done is right so you notice what they done is that< that they comp compare the probability that they comp compare the probability of< of the loss exceeding the buying power of the loss exceeding the buying power requirement< requirement which is the BPR at requirement which is the BPR at expiration< expiration versus at 21 DTE that means expiration versus at 21 DTE that means one< one of them you hold all the way to one of them you hold all the way to expiration< expiration and the other one you exit at expiration and the other one you exit at 21< 21 DTE and here's what they found right 21 DTE and here's what they found right so< so let us take a look at spy so if you so let us take a look at spy so if you take< take a look at spy what you notice is take a look at spy what you notice is that< that if you hold to expiration there's that if you hold to expiration there's roughly< roughly a probability of 1% of your loss roughly a probability of 1% of your loss exceeding< exceeding the BPR so what do we mean by exceeding the BPR so what do we mean by BPR< BPR so this is the buying power required BPR so this is the buying power required to< to put up the trade which is what the to put up the trade which is what the capital< capital is being help your broker holds capital is being help your broker holds this< this capital for you to put on the trade this capital for you to put on the trade so< so let's say for example once you put on so let's say for example once you put on the< the trade you see that the buying power the trade you see that the buying power requirement< requirement or BP effect depending on requirement or BP effect depending on how< how your broker actually categorize this how your broker actually categorize this is< is let's say $11,000 right as an example is let's say $11,000 right as an example now< now spy is much much more expensive but now spy is much much more expensive but of< of course just for this example we make of course just for this example we make it< it much simpler so if you see that it's it much simpler so if you see that it's one< one $1,000 this is the buying power one $1,000 this is the buying power requirement< requirement for this right so the study requirement for this right so the study wants< wants to see how often does it exceed wants to see how often does it exceed this< this number based on holding to this number based on holding to expiration< expiration and 21 DTE so as you can see expiration and 21 DTE so as you can see down< down here there's a 1% chance that you down here there's a 1% chance that you exceed< exceed this exceed this $11,000< $11,000 that means a loss of $1,000 and $11,000 that means a loss of $1,000 and what< what is the max loss as a multiple of what is the max loss as a multiple of BPR< BPR so you can see that it says 1. 6x BPR so you can see that it says 1.

6x that< that means the max loss will be. around that means the max loss will be around 1. 6k< 1.

6k this is if you hold to expiration 1. 6k this is if you hold to expiration now< now what if you exit at 21 DTE so if you now what if you exit at 21 DTE so if you see< see at 21 DTE you notice that the see at 21 DTE you notice that the probability< probability of the loss exceeding this probability of the loss exceeding this buying< buying power requirement at the start buying power requirement at the start when< when you when you put on. this trade is when you when you put on this trade is 0%< 0% which means to say that you will 0% which means to say that you will never< never lose this never lose this $1,000< $1,000 if you exit at 21 DTE and in fact $1,000 if you exit at 21 DTE and in fact what< what is the max loss right you can see what is the max loss right you can see the< the max loss is 0.

6x that means to say the max loss is 0. 6x that means to say your< your loss is only going to be $600 the your loss is only going to be $600 the maximum< maximum right the max loss you're ever maximum right the max loss you're ever going< going to experience when you exit at 21 going to experience when you exit at 21 DTE< DTE is $600 so you can see that straight DTE is $600 so you can see that straight away< away your loss have been reduced by away your loss have been reduced by quite< quite a bit right when you hold to quite a bit right when you hold to expiration< expiration your max loss is 1,600 but expiration your max loss is 1,600 but when< when you exit at 21 DTE it's $1,000 when you exit at 21 DTE it's $1,000 lesser< lesser so when you put on this trade you lesser so when you put on this trade you can< can feel quite confident knowing that can feel quite confident knowing that hey< hey I know that there's a a 0% chance on hey I know that there's a a 0% chance on spy< spy if I exit at 21 DTE of losing $1,000 spy if I exit at 21 DTE of losing $1,000 right< right so this is a very important aspect right so this is a very important aspect especially< especially when you get into trading especially when you get into trading because< because many times people get into because many times people get into trading< trading and they fear right they're trading and they fear right they're going< going to lose everything or more but going to lose everything or more but when< when you have this study and this data when you have this study and this data you< you can understand that hey there's you can understand that hey there's actually< actually 0% chance right if you put it actually 0% chance right if you put it on< on spy right in this case to lose this on spy right in this case to lose this uh< uh initial buying power because the uh initial buying power because the broker< broker when they choose this Capital broker when they choose this Capital amount< amount they actually want it at a pretty amount they actually want it at a pretty large< large number to make sure that they large number to make sure that they cover< cover on their end as well right because cover on their end as well right because what< what if you don't have the necessary what if you don't have the necessary funds< funds to cover the loss so they want to funds to cover the loss so they want to make< make sure that it's at a amount that. make sure that it's at a amount that they< they feel you know it's big enough they feel you know it's big enough whereby< whereby the market or the underlying whereby the market or the underlying that< that you choose won't actually reach that you choose won't actually reach there< there so what about for the iron Condor there so what about for the iron Condor so< so as you can see the iron Condor is so as you can see the iron Condor is similar< similar as well so this is also on spy similar as well so this is also on spy so< so you can see that they compare the so you can see that they compare the different< different uh long Wing Delta so what different uh long Wing Delta so what does< does that mean so imagine this is the does that mean so imagine this is the ion< ion Condor all right so the iron Condor ion Condor all right so the iron Condor uh< uh pnl graph at expiration so these two uh pnl graph at expiration so these two points< points is where your short putut is points is where your short putut is right< right so this one down here is where you right so this one down here is where you put< put your long wi Delta so when they talk put your long wi Delta so when they talk about< about the Deltas down here for example about the Deltas down here for example down< down here is 13 Deltas what they're down here is 13 Deltas what they're trying< trying to say is that they chose the 13 trying to say is that they chose the 13 Delta< Delta strike price on both sides right Delta strike price on both sides right so< so if you look at your option chain if so if you look at your option chain if you< you go to the Delta and it shows 13 you go to the Delta and it shows 13 Delta< Delta that is the strike price that they Delta that is the strike price that they choose< choose and they use this for their choose and they use this for their studies< studies right so as you can see down studies right so as you can see down here< here if you were to hold the iron Condor here if you were to hold the iron Condor all< all the way to expiration and you based all the way to expiration and you based on< on the 13 Delta long Wing then you will on the 13 Delta long Wing then you will see< see that the probability of reaching the see that the probability of reaching the max< max loss is max loss is 6.

4%< 6. 4% but if you were to exit at 21 DTE 6.

4% but if you were to exit at 21 DTE you< you will see that the chances or the you will see that the chances. or the probability< probability of reaching this Max loss probability of reaching this Max loss before< before 21 DD is before 21 DD is 0. 4%< 0.

4% which means to say there's a very 0. 4% which means to say there's a very very< very lower chance of you actually very lower chance of you actually hitting< hitting the max loss on this trade if hitting the max loss on this trade if you< you exit at 21 DTE so here's another you exit at 21 DTE so here's another study< study again so this is on the strangle study again so this is on the strangle so< so as you can see down here they compar so as you can see down here they compar various< various exit strategies so this earlier various exit strategies so this earlier down< down here just means you're exiting at down here just means you're exiting at 21< 21 DTE so you can see that the largest 21 DTE so you can see that the largest loss< loss so down here is basically uh one of loss so down here is basically uh one of the< the tasty trade team members his hand is the tasty. trade team members his hand is covering< covering basically it says largest loss covering basically it says largest loss so< so the largest loss you can see it's so the largest loss you can see it's much< much smaller compared to so if you hold much smaller compared to so if you hold to< to expiration or even the 50% winner to expiration or even the 50% winner because< because the 50% winner basically your because the 50% winner basically your take< take profit is at 50% but if it doesn't take profit is at 50% but if it doesn't reach< reach that you're holding to expiration reach that you're holding to expiration so< so that is why the largest loss is so that is why the largest loss is pretty< pretty much the same so you can see that pretty much the same so you can see that if< if you hold to expiration your loss is if you hold to expiration your loss is about< about 2.

5k but if you exit at 21 DT your about 2. 5k but if you exit at 21 DT your max< max loss or the largest loss is only at max loss or the largest loss is only at $1,710< $1,710 now what about for the short $1,710 now what about for the short putut< putut so this is the short putut on spy putut so this is the short putut on spy so< so similarly as you can see the largest so similarly as you can see the largest loss< loss when you exit at 21tt has been loss when you exit at 21tt has been reduced< reduced significantly compared to if you reduced significantly compared to if you hold< hold to expiration and it's the same for hold to expiration and it's the same for the< the Jade lizard as well right the Jade the Jade lizard as well right the Jade lizard< lizard also same thing the largest loss lizard also same thing the largest loss has< has been reduced much significantly has been reduced much significantly compared< compared to if you hold to exploration compared to if you hold to exploration now< now what about credit spreads. or in now what about credit spreads or in particular< particular the put credit spread or the particular the put credit spread or the bull< bull put spread by the way if you like bull put spread by the way if you like this< this video so far Please Subscribe and this video so far Please Subscribe and also< also click the thumbs up button and also also click the thumbs up button and also do< do get your free copy of the options do get your free copy of the options income< income blueprint where I sh the top income blueprint where I sh the top three< three options strategies that help you three options strategies that help you generate< generate a consistent income each month generate a consistent income each month trading< trading just one to two hours a day trading just one to two hours a day right< right so if you want to go ahead to get right so if you want to go ahead to get this< this copy just head on over to options this copy just head on over to options with< with davis.

com blueprint all right back with davis. com blueprint all right back to< to the video as you can see over here to the video as you can see over here they< they compared the two different types of they compared the two different types of put< put spread one is a static put spread put spread one is a static put spread where< where the width is $5 wide and the other where the width is $5 wide and the other one< one is a dynamic one where they craft one is a dynamic one where they craft the< the spread based on the Delta right so the spread based on the Delta right so as< as you can see in both cases if you were as you can see in both cases if you were to< to exit early right which is exiting at to exit early right which is exiting at 21< 21 DTE your average loss is actually 21 DTE your average loss is actually much< much smaller than if you hold to much smaller than if you hold to expiration< expiration now at this point you might expiration now at this point you might be< be asking but Davis can I just use a be asking but Davis can I just use a stop< stop loss to reduce my Max loss ah good stop loss to reduce my Max loss ah good question< question young pan learn the difference question young pan learn the difference between< between stop loss and 21 DTE you must between stop loss and 21 DTE you must okay< okay so that's my very bad impression of okay so that's my very bad impression of a< a Yoda but Yoda will definitely approve a Yoda but Yoda will definitely approve of< of the following studies which I'm about of the following studies which I'm about to< to show you so as you can see over here to show you so as you can see over here most< most likely the tasty trade team also most likely the tasty trade team also had< had a lot of questions regarding stop had a lot of questions regarding stop losses< losses and that is why they have done losses and that is why they have done quite< quite a number of studies pretty quite a number of studies pretty extensive< extensive studies to compare the extensive studies to compare the performance< performance of a holding to expirations performance of a holding to expirations versus< versus if you actually use a stop- loss versus if you actually use a stop- loss to< to exit your trade right so over here to exit your trade right so over here this< this is a study of the strangle so this is a study of the strangle so basically< basically what they done down here is basically what they done down here is that< that uh if you have a stop- loss at 2x that uh if you have a stop- loss at 2x which< which means to say if you your credit which means to say if you your credit which< which you receive is a doll the stop- which you receive is a doll the stop- loss< loss they put is at $2 so remember for loss they put is at $2 so remember for selling< selling options if you want to make a selling options if you want to make a profit< profit you have to always buy back or profit you have to always buy back or close< close the trade at a lower price to what close the trade at a lower price to what you< you sold it for so if you sold it for $1 you sold it for so if you sold it for $1 to< to make a profit you want to buy it back to make a profit you want to buy it back for< for lesser than $1 if you buy it back for lesser than $1 if you buy it back for< for more than a dollar this is where the for more than a dollar this is where the loss< loss is going to be so this managing loss is going to be so this managing loser< loser part is where the stop loss is loser part is where the stop loss is either< either at $2 or $3 it's one of them either at $2 or $3 it's one of them right< right it's either a $200 loss or a $100 right it's either a $200 loss or a $100 loss< loss based on a $1 premium so you can loss based on a $1 premium so you can see< see down here they compare both of them see down here they compare both of them and< and at the end of the day right over a and at the end of the day right over a number< number of years you can see down here number of years you can see down here the< the studies have dated back to 2006 so the studies have dated back to 2006 so this< this is a pretty uh extensive study over this is a pretty uh extensive study over the< the past you know 10 years or so and you the past you know 10 years or so and you can< can see over here holding to exploration can see over here holding to exploration actually< actually does better compared to if you actually does better compared to if you have< have a stop loss right at 2x now what have a stop loss right at 2x now what about< about for the shut so it's the same for about for the shut so it's the same for the< the shut as well if you hold to the shut as well if you hold to expiration< expiration it's going to be a better expiration it's going to be a better performance< performance than the stop loss same performance than the stop loss same thing< thing for spreads right spreads you can thing for spreads right spreads you can see< see if you hold to expiration you do see if you hold to expiration you do better< better than the stop- loss and you might better than the stop- loss and you might be< be asking as well but if is this 2x you be asking as well but if is this 2x you know< know what if I want to do 1X 2x 3x or 5x know what if I want to do 1X 2x 3x or 5x the< the stop- loss of the premium that I the stop- loss of the premium that I received< received well in that case the tasty received well in that case the tasty trade< trade team has also already done the trade team has also already done the study< study on that so as you can see down study on that so as you can see down here< here they say no matter how managing here they say no matter how managing losers< losers fail to outperform holding to losers fail to outperform holding to expiration< expiration so straight away we can see expiration so straight away we can see from< from here if you use a stop loss it's from here if you use a stop loss it's not< not as effective as compared to if you not as effective as compared to if you hold< hold all the way to expiration now no hold all the way to expiration now no doubt< doubt they all can still be profitable doubt they all can still be profitable right< right as you can see stop losses right as you can see stop losses regardless< regardless of 2x or 5x you see you still regardless of 2x or 5x you see you still are< are in a profit but your performance is are in a profit but your performance is still< still not as good if you hold to still not as good if you hold to expiration< expiration now what about 21 DTE how is expiration now what about 21 DTE how is the< the performance of 21 DTE well the tasty the performance of 21 DTE well the tasty trade< trade team has also compared if you exit trade team has also compared if you exit at< at 21 DTE versus if you hold to at 21 DTE versus if you hold to expiration< expiration and in all the different expiration and in all the different strategies< strategies that they have tested as you strategies that they have tested as you can< can see exiting at 21 DTE actually gives can see exiting at 21 DTE actually gives you< you a much better performance right so you a much better performance right so this< this is for the strangle this is. for the this is for the strangle this is for the short< short putut this is for the put spread short putut this is for the put spread and< and this is for the iron Condor as you and this is for the iron Condor as you can< can see all of them just does better if can see all of them just does better if you< you exit at 21 DTE instead of holding to you exit at 21 DTE instead of holding to expiration< expiration so this is the very first expiration so this is the very first important< important reason why you want to use use important reason why you want to use use exit< exit at 21 DTE which is to reduce your exit at 21 DTE which is to reduce your max< max loss now the second reason is that max loss now the second reason is that exiting< exiting at 21 DTE reduces p&amp;l volatility exiting at 21 DTE reduces p&amp;l volatility so< so what does p&amp;l volatility mean so this so what does p&amp;l volatility mean so this is< is actually very important because p&amp;l is actually very important because p&amp;l volatility< volatility actually affects your mental volatility actually affects your mental state< state it affects your psychology state it affects your psychology basically< basically it's the p&amp;l swing right this basically it's the p&amp;l swing right this is< is also what you can call variance right is also what you can call variance right variance< variance in your p&amp;l so imagine that variance in your p&amp;l so imagine that today< today you're up 500 tomorrow you're down today you're up 500 tomorrow you're down 600< 600 right so this is what you call the 600 right so this is what you call the p&amp;l< p&amp;l volatility when you exit a 21 DTE it p&amp;l volatility when you exit a 21 DTE it actually< actually gives you a much smoother p&amp;l actually gives you a much smoother p&amp;l graph< graph compared to if you exit at graph compared to if you exit at expiration< expiration so over here you can see the expiration so over here you can see the tasty< tasty trade team have actually done a tasty trade team have actually done a in-depth< in-depth study as to you know what's the in-depth study as to you know what's the difference< difference between managing at 21 DTE difference between managing at 21 DTE that< that means exiting at 21 DTE compared to that means exiting at 21 DTE compared to if< if you hold to expiration so you can see if you hold to expiration so you can see over< over here this is comparing the Delta over here this is comparing the Delta movement< movement if you exit at 21 tte you can movement if you exit at 21 tte you can see< see that the Delta movement down here is see that the Delta movement down here is pretty< pretty controll compared to if you were pretty controll compared to if you were to< to exit at expiration right you can see to exit at expiration right you can see if< if you hold to expiration the Deltas now if you hold to expiration the Deltas now become< become so white right the swing in the become so white right the swing in the delt< delt become so white so you might be delt become so white so you might be wondering< wondering how does this Delta swing wondering how does this Delta swing actually< actually affect your p&amp;l well basically actually affect your p&amp;l well basically the< the movement in the Delta actually the movement in the Delta actually affects< affects your p&amp;l swing so if you were to affects your p&amp;l swing so if you were to take< take a look at this down here so there take a look at this down here so there are< are two option change down here on the are two option change down here on the left< left hand side is at 20 DTE and and at left hand side is at 20 DTE and and at the< the right hand side is at zero DTE so the right hand side is at zero DTE so for< for example on the day itself right for example on the day itself right imagine< imagine there's a swing from 541 all the imagine there's a swing from 541 all the way< way to 552 with this swing in movement way to 552 with this swing in movement you< you can see that the premium really you can see that the premium really moves< moves differently as well compared to at moves differently as well compared to at zero< zero DTE you can see that at zero DTE zero DTE you can see that at zero DTE the< the swing is about the swing is about $511< $511 right so that means during the day $511 right so that means during the day itself< itself if the market actually moves itself if the market actually moves about< about say about 11 points you will see a about say about 11 points you will see a swing< swing your P out of 511 but if you exit swing your P out of 511 but if you exit 20< 20 DTE then the swing itself is only 20 DTE then the swing itself is only about< about $442 so it's much lesser compared about $442 so it's much lesser compared to< to if you hold to zero TT so this is the to if you hold to zero TT so this is the effect< effect of the p&amp;l volatility now at the effect of the p&amp;l volatility now at the same< same time the tasty trade team also did same time the tasty trade team also did studies< studies so as you can see over here they studies so as you can see over here they want< want to examine what happens after 21 DT want to examine what happens after 21 DT so< so as you can see down here they say so as you can see down here they say looking< looking at the long-term trade looking at the long-term trade statistics< statistics for 16 Delta strangles statistics for 16 Delta strangles managed< managed early versus held to experation managed early versus held to experation we< we see that managing trades early we see that managing trades early provides< provides higher daily pnl with lower provides higher daily pnl with lower volatility< volatility of daily pnl right so as you volatility of daily pnl right so as you can< can see over here the volatility of the can see over here the volatility of the p&amp;l< p&amp;l per trade as percentage of credit is p&amp;l per trade as percentage of credit is much< much lower when you exit at 21 DTE right much lower when you exit at 21 DTE right 114%< 114% versus 114% versus 233%< 233% same thing as the volatility of 233% same thing as the volatility of daily< daily p&amp;l as a percentage of credit so daily p&amp;l as a percentage of credit so 34%< 34% if you exit at 21 DTE and 47% if you 34% if you exit at 21 DTE and 47% if you exit< exit at expiration so here's another exit at expiration so here's another very< very interesting study that the T trade very interesting study that the T trade team< team did and that is they actually team did and that is they actually measure< measure how the pnl actually moves or measure how the pnl actually moves or the< the pnl that you actually get from the the pnl that you actually get from the 45< 45 DT Mark to 21 DT Mark and then 45 DT Mark to 21 DT Mark and then compare< compare it from 21 DT to expiration and compare it from 21 DT to expiration and what< what they found is that for the average what they found is that for the average daily< daily p&amp;l as a percentage of credit you daily p&amp;l as a percentage of credit you actually< actually get a higher percentage of it actually get a higher percentage of it from< from the 45 DT to the 21 DTE Mark that from the 45 DT to the 21 DTE Mark that means< means you actually get more of the means you actually get more of the credit< credit uh at the start of the trade credit uh at the start of the trade compared< compared to towards the last 21 days compared to towards the last 21 days because< because at the last 21 days you only because at the last 21 days you only make< make about 0.

#### Topic 1

3% of the credit for each make about 0. 3% of the credit for each of< of the days that you hold and the of the days that you hold and the volatility< volatility as you can see over here is volatility as you can see over here is much< much lower during the first half of the much lower during the first half of the trade< trade compared to the last half of the trade compared to the last half of the trade< trade right your p&amp;l swing is much wider trade right your p&amp;l swing is much wider from< from 21 DTE all the way to zero so that from 21 DTE all the way to zero so that is< is why when you exit 21 DTE your p&amp;l is why when you exit 21 DTE your p&amp;l swing< swing right this volatility is not going swing right this volatility is not going to< to be as high compared to if you hold it to be as high compared to if you hold it all< all the way to expiration from the 21 all the way to expiration from the 21 DTE< DTE Mark so that is why if you see you DTE Mark so that is why if you see you know< know a huge swing in your p&amp;l most know a huge swing in your p&amp;l most likely< likely most of the time it's because you likely most of the time it's because you are< are holding it all the way closer to are holding it all the way closer to expiration< expiration during the last few days of expiration during the last few days of the< the trade that's when you see a very the trade that's when you see a very huge< huge swing in your p&amp;l and finally huge swing in your p&amp;l and finally reason< reason number three XD at21 DT increases reason number three XD at21 DT increases overall< overall performance so this is the most overall performance so this is the most important< important part right why we want to exit important part right why we want to exit at< at 21 DT versus if you hold all the way at 21 DT versus if you hold all the way to< to experation is because over the to experation is because over the long-term< long-term we actually get better results long-term we actually get better results so< so as you can see over here this is the so as you can see over here this is the study< study for the strangle and if you were study for the strangle and if you were to< to take a look at the daily pnl if you to take a look at the daily pnl if you were< were to exit at 21 DTE you'll find that were to exit at 21 DTE you'll find that the< the average daily pnl is actually higher the average daily pnl is actually higher right< right that means you actually make much right that means you actually make much more< more on a per day basis if you exit at more on a per day basis if you exit at 21< 21 DTE compared to if you hold all the 21 DTE compared to if you hold all the way< way to exploration so as you can see way to exploration so as you can see over< over here this is the long-term over here this is the long-term performance< performance of the strangle on spy uh performance of the strangle on spy uh comparing< comparing 21 DT of expiration over the comparing 21 DT of expiration over the past< past 14 15 years right even at the past 14 15 years right even at the pandemic< pandemic and as you can see towards the pandemic and as you can see towards the end< end uh the 21 DT still does better than end uh the 21 DT still does better than the< the holding to expiration now at the end the holding to expiration now at the end although< although not that much difference but although not that much difference but the< the main difference is because at 21 DT the main difference is because at 21 DT there< there was one trade apparently according there was one trade apparently according to< to the TC trade team that so happens to the TC trade team that so happens happened< happened to be exited when it was at its happened to be exited when it was at its worst< worst loss before the market eventually worst loss before the market eventually recovered< recovered right so as you know 2020 was recovered right so as you know 2020 was a< a very quick down move and then it a very quick down move and then it quickly< quickly came up so this 21 DTE Mark so quickly came up so this 21 DTE Mark so happens< happens to be at the point where the happens to be at the point where the market< market was coming down right and then market was coming down right and then they< they exited it and then they put on the they exited it and then they put on the trade< trade whereas holding to expiration they trade whereas holding to expiration they actually< actually missed that but if you were to actually missed that but if you were to see< see all the way back to 2008 over here see all the way back to 2008 over here right< right 2008 you will notice that if you right 2008 you will notice that if you hold< hold all the way to expiration you hold all the way to expiration you actually< actually have a much bigger draw down actually have a much bigger draw down right< right which which is actually pretty right which which is actually pretty scary< scary but if you actually exit at 21 DTE scary but if you actually exit at 21 DTE you< you actually have a much lower p&amp;l you actually have a much lower p&amp;l volatility< volatility the swing in your pnl so same volatility the swing in your pnl so same thing< thing for the short putut as you can see thing for the short putut as you can see over< over here the annualized rooc is 21% over here the annualized rooc is 21% when< when you exit at 21 DTE and only 18% if when you exit at 21 DTE and only 18% if you< you exit at expiration and over here is you exit at expiration and over here is the< the long-term performance of the short the long-term performance. of the short putut< putut comparing the 21 DTE versus putut comparing the 21 DTE versus holding< holding to exploration and as you can holding to exploration and as you can see< see 21 DTE does better and same for the see 21 DTE does better and same for the jet< jet lizard as well right if you do the J jet lizard as well right if you do the J lizard< lizard exiting at 21 DTE you get a lizard exiting at 21 DTE you get a higher< higher return compared to holding to higher return compared to holding to expiration< expiration and the long-term performance expiration and the long-term performance shows< shows as well right 21 DD does better shows as well right 21 DD does better than< than holding to expiration so the T than holding to expiration so the T trade< trade team as you can see over here it trade team as you can see over here it says< says managing early approach is a clear says managing early approach is a clear winner< winner due to its Superior return and winner due to its Superior return and volatility< volatility control in most times and for volatility control in most times and for the< the put spread right as you can see if the put spread right as you can see if you< you were to manage earlier same thing as you were to manage earlier same thing as well< well you get a higher return compared to well you get a higher return compared to holding< holding to expiration holding to expiration and< and if you see the long-term performance and if you see the long-term performance 21< 21 DTE still outperforms holding to 21 DTE still outperforms holding to expiration< expiration and this is for the iron expiration and this is for the iron Condor< Condor so the iron Condor as you can see Condor so the iron Condor as you can see the< the daily p&amp;l the average p&amp;l per day is the daily p&amp;l the average p&amp;l per day is still< still higher when you exit at 21 DTE and still higher when you exit at 21 DTE and the< the long-term performance is also higher the long-term performance is also higher as< as well when you exit at 21 DTE now at as well when you exit at 21 DTE now at this< this point you might be asking but Davis this point you might be asking but Davis what< what if I just enter at 24 DTE and just what if I just enter at 24 DTE and just hold< hold to exploration right because if I hold to exploration right because if I enter< enter at 45 5 DTE and then I exited at enter at 45 5 DTE and then I exited at 21< 21 DTE the holding period is around 24 21 DTE the holding period is around 24 days< days right so if the holding period is days right so if the holding period is 24< 24 days why can't I just choose the 24 24 days why can't I just choose the 24 DTE< DTE and then I just simply hold it all DTE and then I just simply hold it all the< the way to expiration so in this case the way to expiration so in this case both< both the trades are 24 days long would both the trades are 24 days long would the< the result be better if I just do this the result be better if I just do this well< well this question has also been asked well this question has also been asked to< to the tasty trade team already and they to the tasty trade team already and they have< have already a study on this so as you have already a study on this so as you can< can see over here they compare if you can see over here they compare if you entered< entered at 45 DTE and then you exit at entered at 45 DTE and then you exit at 21< 21 DTE versus if you just enter at 24 21 DTE versus if you just enter at 24 DTE< DTE and then you hold to expiration and DTE and then you hold to expiration and straight< straight away you can see the straight away you can see the performance< performance of managing at 21 DTE is performance of managing at 21 DTE is much< much much better than if you just enter much much better than if you just enter at< at 24 DTE and you hold to expiration and at 24 DTE and you hold to expiration and as< as you can see over here they have as you can see over here they have concluded< concluded that the long-term cumulative concluded that the long-term cumulative profitability< profitability also favors the longer profitability also favors the longer duration< duration portfolio if managing early duration portfolio if managing early which< which means to exit at 21 DTE so when which means to exit at 21 DTE so when you< you just simply exit at 21 DTE you get a you just simply exit at 21 DTE you get a much< much better performance compared to if much better performance compared to if you< you hold to expiration so just make this you hold to expiration so just make this one< one change and you will see that you are one change and you will see that you are going< going to get a much better performance going to get a much better performance over< over the long term by the way if you over the long term by the way if you like< like this video then you're absolutely like this video then you're absolutely going< going to love this next video which I going to love this next video which I have< have for you

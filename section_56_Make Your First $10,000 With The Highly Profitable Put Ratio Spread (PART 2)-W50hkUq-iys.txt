============================================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so this is part two all right alrighty so this is part two on< on how to make your first ten thousand on how to make your first ten thousand dollars< dollars with the highly profitable put dollars with the highly profitable put ratio< ratio spread now if you haven't watched ratio spread now if you haven't watched part< part one yet please go ahead and watch part one yet please go ahead and watch that< that first I'll put the link in the that first I'll put the link in the description< description below and also at the top description below and also at the top right< right hand corner of this video alright right hand corner of this video alright so< so for this part two of the video the so for this part two of the video the next< next thing I want to talk about is how next thing I want to talk about is how you< you can reach the potential of the max you can reach the potential of the max profit< profit of the put ratio spread right so profit of the put ratio spread right so if< if you take a look at this spreadsheet if you take a look at this spreadsheet down< down here you can see that there are a down here you can see that there are a number< number of Trades which I had which I number of Trades which I had which I have< have profited over a thousand dollars have profited over a thousand dollars when< when you know the large majority of it when you know the large majority of it is< is only 200 over dollars right so you is only 200 over dollars right so you can< can see there's one or two trades down can see there's one or two trades down here< here there's over two one thousand here there's over two one thousand dollars< dollars here another one 1100 and then dollars here another one 1100 and then you< you have a pretty big one down here one you have a pretty big one down here one thousand< thousand nine hundred and a thousand thousand nine hundred and a thousand five< five hundred and fifteen dollars so in five hundred and fifteen dollars so in order< order for you to really try and reach order for you to really try and reach the< the the max profit to potentially hit the the max profit to potentially hit the< the max profit for the put ratio spread the max profit for the put ratio spread you< you need to hold it all the way to you need to hold it all the way to expiration< expiration and the reason for this is expiration and the reason for this is because< because the put ratio spread is a very because the put ratio spread is a very slow< slow moving spread so what do I mean by slow moving spread so what do I mean by a< a slow spread a slow spread is one a slow spread a slow spread is one whereby< whereby it takes a long time for it to whereby it takes a long time for it to reach< reach the max profit right so unlike a reach the max profit right so unlike a shot< shot put if you were just to go for a shot put if you were just to go for a shot< shot put a shot put can reach its Max shot put a shot put can reach its Max profit< profit pretty quickly right especially profit pretty quickly right especially when< when the market goes up right but when the market goes up right but because< because the put ratio spread has an because the put ratio spread has an embedded< embedded long put spread there is a embedded long put spread there is a little< little bit more uh different it's little bit more uh different it's slightly< slightly more different than the shot slightly more different than the shot put< put because of this zone right so as you put because of this zone right so as you can< can see this is the risk profile where can see this is the risk profile where it's< it's 14 days to expiration so I put on it's 14 days to expiration so I put on this< this spread so this spread initially this spread so this spread initially started< started when there's around 45 days to started when there's around 45 days to expiration< expiration right so you can see expiration right so you can see that< that many days has actually passed in that many days has actually passed in fact< fact 31 days has passed but then there fact 31 days has passed but then there is< is still not much movement in this is still not much movement in this profit< profit Zone you can see that this profit profit Zone you can see that this profit Zone< Zone down here has not even really Zone down here has not even really reached< reached anywhere close this green line reached anywhere close this green line at< at expiration right so this green line at expiration right so this green line is< is the profit that you will stand to is the profit that you will stand to make< make at expiration make at expiration so< so you have put on the spread for 31 so you have put on the spread for 31 days< days but then even though if Mr Market days but then even though if Mr Market actually< actually has gone down all the way to actually has gone down all the way to your< your profit Zone and he has stayed there your profit Zone and he has stayed there guess< guess what you're not making any money guess what you're not making any money in< in fact if he went to this point down in fact if he went to this point down here< here where at expiration you would be at here where at expiration you would be at a< a profit let's say at this line down a profit let's say at this line down here< here you would be at a profit but the here you would be at a profit but the problem< problem is that at 14 days it is a loss problem is that at 14 days it is a loss right< right you can see this is a loss at 14 right you can see this is a loss at 14 days< days to expiration so generally when it days to expiration so generally when it comes< comes to naked options right like shot comes to naked options right like shot put< put short calls or even the strangle you put short calls or even the strangle you generally< generally want to get out at 21 days to generally want to get out at 21 days to expiration< expiration and I mentioned this a few expiration and I mentioned this a few times< times in a few videos in the past and times in a few videos in the past and that< that is actually true because those are that is actually true because those are basically< basically naked options there are no basically naked options there are no long< long put options or long options inside long put options or long options inside it< it right so in those cases the gamma it right so in those cases the gamma will< will pick up very quickly and you can will pick up very quickly and you can stand< stand to actually lose quite a bit of stand to actually lose quite a bit of money< money as it gets closer to the money as it gets closer to the expiration< expiration date as the camera picks up expiration date as the camera picks up because< because you become much more exposed to because you become much more exposed to Direction< Direction but when it comes to the put Direction but when it comes to the put ratio< ratio spread it's slightly different ratio spread it's slightly different because< because you have this embedded long put because you have this embedded long put spread< spread and the only way that you can spread and the only way that you can actually< actually achieve this Max profit is if actually achieve this Max profit is if you< you hold it to expiration if you were to you hold it to expiration if you were to hold< hold it just to 21 days to expiration or hold it just to 21 days to expiration or even< even 14 days to expression as you can even 14 days to expression as you can see< see there's just 14 days left the see there's just 14 days left the expression< expression there's not much that you can expression there's not much that you can make< make down here so if you're going to make down here so if you're going to hold< hold the trade right if you're going to hold the trade right if you're going to put< put on the put ratio square and we just put on the put ratio square and we just want< want to get out around 21 days to want to get out around 21 days to expiration< expiration then it's better not to put expiration then it's better not to put on< on the put ratio spread at all it's on the put ratio spread at all it's better< better that you just go with the simple better that you just go with the simple shot< shot put trade right instead of this put shot put trade right instead of this put ratio< ratio spread if you want to put this put ratio spread if you want to put this put ratio< ratio spread you need to bring it all ratio spread you need to bring it all the< the way to expiration so you can see the way to expiration so you can see this< this is when there's seven days to this is when there's seven days to expiration< expiration as you can see the seven days expiration as you can see the seven days left< left you put it on for almost 40 days left you put it on for almost 40 days and< and it's still nowhere near the max and it's still nowhere near the max profit< profit you can see the max profit down profit you can see the max profit down here< here even though if Mr Market goes down here even though if Mr Market goes down here< here you're still not making much right here you're still not making much right and< and then this is where it's one day to and then this is where it's one day to expiration< expiration you can see one day to expiration you can see one day to expression< expression basically it's around 50 expression basically it's around 50 slightly< slightly above 50 of the maximum profit slightly above 50 of the maximum profit so< so in just one day so in just one day right< right if you were to hit this or if the right if you were to hit this or if the market< market was to stay within this Zone market was to stay within this Zone from< from here to here you can see that in from here to here you can see that in one< one day you can stand to make much more one day you can stand to make much more right< right so the the premium or rather the right so the the premium or rather the amount< amount which you stand to make in just amount which you stand to make in just one< one day is pretty much the kind of one day is pretty much the kind of Premium< Premium that you took right to make in Premium that you took right to make in the< the 45 days or rather 44 days right so the 45 days or rather 44 days right so what< what I'm trying to say is that if what I'm trying to say is that if imagine< imagine if you helped the trade for 44 imagine if you helped the trade for 44 days< days right if you hold the trade to 44 days right if you hold the trade to 44 days< days and this Market just so happens to days and this Market just so happens to be< be in the middle of this profit Zone be in the middle of this profit Zone well< well you only made 50 should you get out well you only made 50 should you get out or< or should you just there now there are or should you just there now there are Arguments< Arguments for both sides but since you Arguments for both sides but since you already< already hold it to 44 days to achieve 50 already hold it to 44 days to achieve 50 of< of the max profit you can actually get of the max profit you can actually get the< the second half of the max profit in the second half of the max profit in just< just one day so as you can see there is just one day so as you can see there is a< a huge huge difference in the kind of a huge huge difference in the kind of profit< profit that you can make from the number profit that you can make from the number of< of days when you first started all the of days when you first started all the way< way to the end way to the end so< so of course during the one day the so of course during the one day the market< market could just Spike down you know or market could just Spike down you know or just< just Spike up out of the profit Zone just Spike up out of the profit Zone there's< there's always the possibility but then there's always the possibility but then again< again this is how the trade is being again this is how the trade is being done< done right you put on this trade from done right you put on this trade from the< the beginning you want to hold it all the beginning you want to hold it all the< the way to expiration and see where it the way to expiration and see where it goes< goes and again it is all a probability goes and again it is all a probability game< game so that is why for the put ratio game so that is why for the put ratio spread< spread if I am not planning to get long spread if I am not planning to get long stock< stock right if I'm not using it to enter stock right if I'm not using it to enter into< into a long stop position if I'm just into a long stop position if I'm just training< training it then I will hold it all the training it then I will hold it all the way< way to expiration now if you were way to expiration now if you were totally< totally all the way to expiration totally all the way to expiration another< another issue will arise the issue would another issue will arise the issue would be< be that what if Mr market right be that what if Mr market right he< he goes all the way past your shot he goes all the way past your shot strike< strike all right let's not say go past strike all right let's not say go past your< your short strike by that much let's your short strike. by that much let's just< just say that he goes all the way to just say that he goes all the way to just< just slightly under your shot put strike just slightly under your shot put strike right< right this is where you have your two right this is where you have your two shot< shot puts down here shot puts down here so< so what happens is that when there is so what happens is that when there is one< one day left to expression or even one day left to expression or even anything< anything less than 21 days there's anything less than 21 days there's always< always a possibility of you to get always a possibility of you to get assigned< assigned right if you're going to get a assigned right if you're going to get a sign< sign on your shop what's going to happen sign on your shop what's going to happen is< is that suddenly you're going to be long is that suddenly you're going to be long 200< 200 shares down here right 200 shares 200 shares down here right 200 shares and< and 200 shares of this price down here and 200 shares of this price down here that< that is eighteen thousand dollars two that is eighteen thousand dollars two hundred< hundred fifty dollars per hundred shares hundred fifty dollars per hundred shares so< so you need double of that right so so you need double of that right so there's< there's about thirty six thirty seven there's about thirty six thirty seven thousand< thousand dollars thousand dollars this< this is where the problem is gonna come this is where the problem is gonna come right< right because you enter this trade right because you enter this trade without< without the expectation that you're without the expectation that you're gonna< gonna buy the shares right now of course gonna buy the shares right now of course you< you can simply just sell off the shares you can simply just sell off the shares and< and then put on the shot put again but and then put on the shot put again but then< then it becomes very Troublesome it then it becomes very Troublesome it becomes< becomes very messy a lot of people get becomes very messy a lot of people get confused< confused by this you know if one site confused by this you know if one site get< get assigned the other the other one get assigned the other the other one doesn't< doesn't get assigned what do I do and doesn't get assigned what do I do and all< all that stuff you want to avoid so the all that stuff you want to avoid so the only< only way you can avoid this is by only way you can avoid this is by trading< trading European style options right so trading European style options right so in< in case you're not familiar there are in case you're not familiar there are two< two types of option style they have the two types of option style they have the American< American Style American Style our< our American style and then you have the our American style and then you have the European< European style options right so for the European style options right so for the American< American style options basically you the American style options basically you the buyer< buyer of the option can exercise the buyer of the option can exercise the option< option at any time before expiration so option at any time before expiration so they< they could buy it today and then they they could buy it today and then they decide< decide to exercise it tomorrow so in decide to exercise it tomorrow so in that< that case because you are the seller of that case because you are the seller of the< the option you have the obligation to uh the option you have the obligation to uh take< take on the other side right so in a put take on the other side right so in a put option< option your obligation is to buy the option your obligation is to buy the shares< shares right so if you was to exercise shares right so if you was to exercise this< this you have no choice you will be this you have no choice you will be assigned< assigned the shares and you need to have assigned the shares and you need to have the< the money to put up for the shares the money to put up for the shares otherwise< otherwise you will have magic call now otherwise you will have magic call now what< what about the European options so the what about the European options so the European< European options in this case is that European options in this case is that there< there is no early assignment in fact the there is no early assignment in fact the only< only time it can only be exercised is only time it can only be exercised is only< only at expiration so that is why you only at expiration so that is why you only< only want to put on the put ratio spread only want to put on the put ratio spread on< on European style options on European style options so< so this way even though the market is so this way even though the market is all< all the way past your short stride all the way past your short stride before< before expiration there's no chance for before expiration there's no chance for your< your options to get exercise so you do your options to get exercise so you do not< not have to worry about being assigned not have to worry about being assigned so< so when it comes to training the put so when it comes to training the put ratio< ratio spread you want to trade what I ratio spread you want to trade what I call< call this European style options that call this European style options that are< are cash settled so at the moment right are cash settled so at the moment right now< now there are basically five of them now there are basically five of them that< that I know of you have the M Rod which that I know of you have the M Rod which is< is basically the mini Russell 2000 Index is basically the mini Russell 2000 Index which< which is the example which I showed you which is the example which I showed you down< down here the embroid this is the mini down here the embroid this is the mini Russell< Russell 2000 Index options so uh Russell 2000 Index options so uh basically< basically it's the Mini version of the basically it's the Mini version of the rut< rut right so the right is the full size rut right so the right is the full size version< version which is much heavier in terms version which is much heavier in terms of< of capital and then you have the XSP of capital and then you have the XSP which< which is the mini SPX index options and which is the mini SPX index options and then< then you have the nestax which is the uh then you have the nestax which is the uh NASDAQ< NASDAQ index options right so basically NASDAQ index options right so basically all< all these five are European style all these five are European style options< options and there's absolutely no risk options and there's absolutely no risk of< of early assignment and this is Cash of early assignment and this is Cash settle< settle which means to say that there is settle which means to say that there is no< no assignment of shares right you won't no assignment of shares right you won't be< be able to get shares at all so once it be able to get shares at all so once it reached< reached expiration it all comes down to reached expiration it all comes down to where< where the market is at expiration okay where the market is at expiration okay so< so if the market is at this point down so if the market is at this point down here< here at expiration then it's just going here at expiration then it's just going to< to expire worthless because you already to expire worthless because you already receive< receive the credit at the start right receive the credit at the start right now< now if Mr Market is going to expire at now if Mr Market is going to expire at this< this point this point Right< Right add expiration basically then your Right add expiration basically then your max< max profit will be at this point so what max profit will be at this point so what will< will happen is that the shortfall in will happen is that the shortfall in this< this profit will be then credited into this profit will be then credited into your< your account now likewise if your uh in your account now likewise if your uh in a< a loss let's say for example Mr Market a loss let's say for example Mr Market is< is down here at expiration then you're is down here at expiration then you're going< going to suffer a loss basically this going to suffer a loss basically this amount< amount will be debited from your account amount will be debited from your account so< so again there's no assignment of shares so again there's no assignment of shares so< so you do not have to worry about that so you do not have to worry about that and< and don't have to worry about early and don't have to worry about early assignment< assignment right so now let's talk a assignment right so now let's talk a little< little bit about a put spread the put little bit about a put spread the put ratio< ratio spread construction basically how ratio spread construction basically how you< you want to put it up so basically you you want to put it up so basically you want< want to put it up at around 45 to 60 want to put it up at around 45 to 60 days< days to expiration all right I explained days to expiration all right I explained this< this many times before to me this is the this many times before to me this is the optimal< optimal uh place where you want to put optimal uh place where you want to put it< it where it is just nice a distance away it where it is just nice a distance away from< from where the market is as well as you from where the market is as well as you can< can have a nice size for your tent right can have a nice size for your tent right your< your profession can be a nice size as your profession can be a nice size as well< well as what's most important is that well as what's most important is that the< the expected move right the impact the expected move right the impact volatility< volatility is more than the actual volatility is more than the actual volatility< volatility when the options are 45 days volatility when the options are 45 days and< and above right this is where impact and above right this is where impact volatility< volatility is greater than historical volatility is greater than historical volatility< volatility anything less than that then volatility anything less than that then it< it has been shown that the statistics is it has been shown that the statistics is that< that the implied quality tends to be that the implied quality tends to be lesser< lesser right so what this means is that lesser right so what this means is that basically< basically if you stick to this this basically if you stick to this this expression< expression for your option you have a expression for your option you have a higher< higher probability higher probability than< than what it states down here all right than what it states down here all right okay< okay so the next is that the shot put okay so the next is that the shot put strike< strike is at the expected Booth as I strike is at the expected Booth as I mentioned< mentioned so expected move is usually mentioned so expected move is usually around< around 15 Deltas to 20 deltas and then around 15 Deltas to 20 deltas and then the< the long put Sprite the long put spread the long put Sprite the long put spread strikes< strikes it depends on your view right if strikes it depends on your view right if you're< you're more bullish you can have a you're more bullish you can have a smaller< smaller width with smaller debit which I smaller width with smaller debit which I shared< shared with you earlier on and then if shared with you earlier on and then if you're< you're more bearish you can build a you're more bearish you can build a larger< larger tent right a larger catchment larger tent right a larger catchment area< area and this will give you a bigger area and this will give you a bigger debit< debit that means it's more expensive for debit that means it's more expensive for you< you to buy the long put spread which you to buy the long put spread which results< results in a smaller overall credit for results in a smaller overall credit for your< your put ratio spread so you have a your put ratio spread so you have a wider< wider larger profit Zone that means you wider larger profit Zone that means you shift< shift your shift your long< long put spread the closer at the market long put spread the closer at the market all< all right if you can remember it looks all right if you can remember it looks something< something like this so your long put something like this so your long put spread< spread is closer to where the current spread is closer to where the current market< market price is market price is and< and then if you want to go for uh narrow and then if you want to go for uh narrow but< but higher profit potential you can have but higher profit potential you can have a< a out the money long strike which would a out the money long strike which would good< good something like this right so this good something like this right so this is< is not as near to the market as possible is not as near to the market as possible but< but you still have a decently wide but you still have a decently wide

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video okay so how often and back to the video okay so how often and when< when do you enter into a put ratio when do you enter into a put ratio spread< spread so first of all there are two spread so first of all there are two ways< ways the first way is to enter the put ways the first way is to enter the put ratio< ratio spread one at a time all right so ratio spread one at a time all right so if< if you're just new to put ratio spread if you're just new to put ratio spread and< and you want to get your feet wet then and you want to get your feet wet then this< this is the way that I suggest you do it this is the way that I suggest you do it first< first right so basically you put on a first right so basically you put on a put< put ratio spread one that is time so put ratio spread one that is time so let's< let's say for example the price is now let's say for example the price is now and< and you've decided to put on the put and you've decided to put on the put ratio< ratio spread so the put ratio spread ratio spread so the put ratio spread would< would be something like this so once you would be something like this so once you put< put on the put ratio spread basically put on the put ratio spread basically you< you wait all the way to expiration once you wait all the way to expiration once it< it expires then you put on another trade it expires then you put on another trade again< again right so this is very good if again right so this is very good if you're< you're just starting out so you you're just starting out so you understand< understand the Dynamics of the put ratio understand the Dynamics of the put ratio spread< spread and just get a little bit of a spread and just get a little bit of a feeling< feeling first before you know you start feeling first before you know you start to< to put on even more put ratio spread and to put on even more put ratio spread and for< for this you want to be quite selective for this you want to be quite selective right< right so basically what you want to do right so basically what you want to do is< is you want to look at a few things on is you want to look at a few things on the< the chart so first of all as I mentioned the chart so first of all as I mentioned in< in many of my previous videos you want in many of my previous videos you want to< to take a look at support areas to take a look at support areas all< all right so significant support areas all right so significant support areas and< and then also you might want to consider and then also you might want to consider looking< looking at these stochastics right so looking at these stochastics right so stochastic< stochastic indicator is basically where stochastic indicator is basically where it< it monitors the markets condition it monitors the markets condition whether< whether it's overbought or oversold so whether it's overbought or oversold so let's< let's say for example if the stochastics let's say for example if the stochastics is< is showing that it's almost you know is showing that it's almost you know right< right in the oversold region or almost right in the oversold region or almost at< at the oversold region somewhere around at the oversold region somewhere around here here here right< right what you could do is you want to right what you could do is you want to place< place the put ratio spread right so what place the put ratio spread right so what you< you want to do is you want to see you want to do is you want to see whether< whether the expected move is below a whether the expected move is below a support< support area so let's say for example at support area so let's say for example at this< this point in time you see that there's this point in time you see that there's a< a support area here and then you take a a support area here and then you take a look< look at the expected move if the look at the expected move if the expected< expected move shows that the strike is expected move shows that the strike is going< going to be somewhere at 390 right at going to be somewhere at 390 right at this< this point at 390 that means your put this point at 390 that means your put ratio< ratio spread might look something like ratio spread might look something like this< this right so this is where the short this right so this is where the short strike< strike is and then like that this is strike is and then like that this is where< where the cutoff point is and then pass where the cutoff point is and then pass this< this point right somewhere down here this point right somewhere down here this< this is where you'll start to lose money this is where you'll start to lose money right< right let me just draw the line down right let me just draw the line down here< here so somewhere down here it will here so somewhere down here it will start< start to lose money okay so at this start to lose money okay so at this point< point of time you might want to ask point of time you might want to ask yourself< yourself whether this is the place where yourself whether this is the place where you< you want to put the put racial spread you want to put the put racial spread because< because remember you only have one put because remember you only have one put ratio< ratio spread to put at a time where the ratio spread to put at a time where the win< win or loss comes down to where it win or loss comes down to where it settles< settles at expiration so if there's a settles at expiration so if there's a support< support here there's a chance at the support here there's a chance at the market< market right might come down and then market right might come down and then bounce< bounce up somewhere down here now if you bounce up somewhere down here now if you feel< feel that this um put ratio spread or feel that this um put ratio spread or rather< rather where the strike is rather where the strike is is< is a little bit too high up you might is a little bit too high up you might want< want to wait for the market to go down want to wait for the market to go down so< so let me just draw this support area so let me just draw this support area again< again so let's say for example you want again so let's say for example you want to< to place the short stripe of the put to place the short stripe of the put ratio< ratio spread below this support area so ratio spread below this support area so in< in this case if you notice that the in this case if you notice that the expected< expected move shows that you can only expected move shows that you can only place< place the short strike at 390 then you place the short strike at 390 then you want< want to wait for the market to go a want to wait for the market to go a little< little bit further down first right so little bit further down first right so once< once it goes a little bit further down once it goes a little bit further down you< you take a look at the expected move you take a look at the expected move again< again and if you see that the short again and if you see that the short strikes< strikes can be at 370 then this is where strikes can be at 370 then this is where you< you want to enter into your put ratio you want to enter into your put ratio spread< spread because your put ratio spread spread because your put ratio spread would< would probably look something like this would probably look something like this right< right so this is where your 10th is right so this is where your 10th is remember< remember the short put strikes is where remember the short put strikes is where the< the height or the maximum potential the height or the maximum potential profit< profit can be gained now as you get a profit can be gained now as you get a little< little bit more experience or you have a little bit more experience or you have a little< little bit more Capital you want to little bit more Capital you want to start< start to put on more put ratio spreads start to put on more put ratio spreads right< right so for example right so for example let's< let's say you have a larger account size let's say you have a larger account size and< and you're able to put on two put ratio and you're able to put on two put ratio spread< spread at a time right let's say you can spread at a time right let's say you can put< put put two put ratio spare at a time put put two put ratio spare at a time based< based on your buying power and the risk based on your buying power and the risk that< that you've allocated per trade so that you've allocated per trade so instead< instead of just putting two put ratios instead of just putting two put ratios at< at the same place right let's say for at the same place right let's say for example< example you have one put ratio spec down example you have one put ratio spec down here here here all< all right a poor retrospect let's say all right a poor retrospect let's say you< you can put 2x to put ratios back down you can put 2x to put ratios back down here< here instead of doing this what you want here instead of doing this what you want to< to do is you want to spread out your put to do is you want to spread out your put ratio< ratio spread right instead of putting ratio spread right instead of putting two< two you want to only put one then maybe two you want to only put one then maybe as< as the market moves either it goes up or as the market moves either it goes up or it< it goes down let's say for example it it goes down let's say for example it goes< goes up or down again goes up or down again then< then you can choose to put another put then you can choose to put another put ratio< ratio spread so maybe you might want to ratio spread so maybe you might want to put< put it somewhere around here so what put it somewhere around here so what this< this does is that you're diversifying this does is that you're diversifying your< your put ratio spread in terms of your put ratio spread in terms of different< different price different day and time different price different day and time and< and also different days to expiration so and also different days to expiration so this< this way you're kind of like evening out this way you're kind of like evening out your< your p l right your p l variance will be your p l right your p l variance will be much< much lesser than if you were to put all much lesser than if you were to put all at< at just one place right so this is the at just one place right so this is the approach< approach that I want to take so as you approach that I want to take so as you get< get more experience and you have many uh get more experience and you have many uh you< you have more buying power you want to you have more buying power you want to place< place your put ratio spread at different place your put ratio spread at different places< places so for me this is the method that places so for me this is the method that I< I actually use which you have seen in I actually use which you have seen in the< the spreadsheet in my previous video so the spreadsheet in my previous video so basically< basically what I did is I would place basically what I did is I would place the< the put ratio spread at different points the put ratio spread at different points right< right so I'll put a put ratio spread right so I'll put a put ratio spread when< when the price maybe drops down a little when the price maybe drops down a little bit< bit right I'll put one here if it goes bit right I'll put one here if it goes up< up again I'll put another one down here up again I'll put another one down here as< as it goes down again I'll put another as it goes down again I'll put another one< one down here so this way I have many one down here so this way I have many different< different catchment in areas so this way different catchment in areas so this way I< I have many different chances of trying I have many different chances of trying to< to hit that Max profit rather than just to hit that Max profit rather than just to< to single down to just one area to hit to single down to just one area to hit the< the the max profit which is a little bit the the max profit which is a little bit of< of a hit and miss right so the next of a hit and miss right so the next thing< thing is that when I put on this put thing is that when I put on this put ratio< ratio spread I put on different strikes ratio spread I put on different strikes for< for the long put spread right as you for the long put spread right as you have< have seen in the previous slides you have seen in the previous slides you have< have seen that there are many different have seen that there are many different type< type of put ratio spread okay so for type of put ratio spread okay so for example< example the first preparation spread example the first preparation spread that< that might put on might be the that might put on might be the traditional< traditional put ratio spread it looks traditional put ratio spread it looks something< something like this right so where something like this right so where basically< basically the short strikes are all at basically the short strikes are all at the< the same point and then the second one I the same point and then the second one I may< may enter one where the long put spread may enter one where the long put spread I< I changed the strikes a little bit so it I changed the strikes a little bit so it looks< looks probably something like this where looks probably something like this where it's< it's much closer to at the market right it's much closer to at the market right so< so where the long put spread is down so where the long put spread is down here< here and then the short strike where here and then the short strike where this< this expected move is over here so it this expected move is over here so it looks< looks something like this and for the looks something like this and for the next< next one I mean one one that the next one I mean one one that the catchment< catchment area is really very big that catchment area is really very big that means< means I have a really huge tent but then means I have a really huge tent but then I< I forgo a lot of the credit up front so I forgo a lot of the credit up front so I< I may have the third one that goes I may have the third one that goes something< something like this so this way I have a something like this so this way I have a chance< chance of catching this big potential chance of catching this big potential profit< profit area if the market does settle profit area if the market does settle here< here at expiration so this way I'm here at expiration so this way I'm really< really diversifying on all different really diversifying on all different fronts< fronts right I have different prices fronts right I have different prices different< different strikes different timing which different strikes different timing which I< I enter different days and also at I enter different days and also at different< different using different types of put different using different types of put ratio< ratio spread okay so when do you enter ratio spread okay so when do you enter into< into a put ratio spread so generally into a put ratio spread so generally when< when I enter into a putration spread I when I enter into a putration spread I want< want to enter it on a down day right so want to enter it on a down day right so you< you can see these candlesticks when it's you can see these candlesticks when it's down< down right so obviously I do not enter down right so obviously I do not enter every< every time there is a down day basically every time there is a down day basically I<. I will just choose at different prices I will just choose at different prices and< and again this is up to your own and again this is up to your own discretion< discretion and your view of the market discretion and your view of the market but< but basically what you want to do when but basically what you want to do when you're< you're entering into a poor ratio spread you're entering into a poor ratio spread is< is when the market is going down right is when the market is going down right so< so the reason is because most of the so the reason is because most of the time< time right now not all the time but most time right now not all the time but most of< of the time when the market is going of the time when the market is going down< down the IV is increased right when you down the IV is increased right when you have< have an increased IV you're going to have an increased IV you're going to have< have a put ratio spread where the tent have a put ratio spread where the tent can< can be much higher right where you have can be much higher right where you have this< this higher Max profit potential right this higher Max profit potential right so< so this is exactly what we want to get so this is exactly what we want to get when< when we are placing on the put ratio when we are placing on the put ratio spread< spread at the same time we will get more spread at the same time we will get more premium< premium and you're able to get a better premium and you're able to get a better Break< Break Even Point compared to if you were Break Even Point compared to if you were to< to enter on an update so generally on an to enter on an update so generally on an update< update most of the time the IV will update most of the time the IV will actually< actually drop so when the IV drop you're actually drop so when the IV drop you're not< not going to be able to build a put not going to be able to build a put ratio< ratio spread that has a higher Max ratio spread that has a higher Max profit< profit potential compared to when the IV profit potential compared to when the IV is< is increased so maybe when the IV is is increased so maybe when the IV is lower< lower the put ratio spread that you can lower the put ratio spread that you can craft< craft maybe would be something like this craft maybe would be something like this where< where the maximum profit is going to be where the maximum profit is going to be much< much lower right if it's going to be much lower right if it's going to be much< much lower you're not going to be making much lower you're not going to be making much< much more and especially your break-even much more and especially your break-even point< point will be closer to the market and point will be closer to the market and this< this is where your risk can really this is where your risk can really increase< increase because as you know when the increase because as you know when the market< market crashes and especially if your market crashes and especially if your break-even< break-even point is much closer to the break-even point is much closer to the market< market then you're not going to have a market then you're not going to have a big< big enough catchment area in case the big enough catchment area in case the market< market really goes all the way down market really goes all the way down right< right so that is why I prefer to enter right so that is why I prefer to enter into< into a put ratio spread when the market into a put ratio spread when the market is< is going down next we're going to be is going down next we're going to be talking< talking about a very important point and talking about a very important point and that< that is capital allocation so this is that is capital allocation so this is very< very important because if you do the very important because if you do the wrong< wrong Capital allocation and even though wrong Capital allocation and even though you< you have a good strategy on you could you have a good strategy on you could actually< actually lose your whole account actually lose your whole account remember< remember this is an undefined risk that remember this is an undefined risk that means< means that is the potential for you to means that is the potential for you to lose< lose a lot of money as you can see in lose a lot of money as you can see in this< this order ticket here it says the max this order ticket here it says the max loss< loss is so much all right 17 000 plus loss is so much all right 17 000 plus but< but you're not going to reach that okay but you're not going to reach that okay so< so let me just explain to you ideally so let me just explain to you ideally what< what you want to do so first of all you what you want to do so first of all you do< do not want to risk more than one do not want to risk more than one percent< percent to five percent per put ratio percent to five percent per put ratio spread< spread all right so ideally this is the spread all right so ideally this is the max< max you want to go if you have a smaller max you want to go if you have a smaller account< account then you have no choice but to account then you have no choice but to really< really only reach up to five percent or really only reach up to five percent or in< in some cases maybe even 10 right that's in some cases maybe even 10 right that's really< really the max you want to go so since really the max you want to go so since this< this is an undefined risk trade how do this is an undefined risk trade how do you< you identify what the risk is how do you you identify what the risk is how do you calculate< calculate this one to five percent well calculate this one to five percent well the< the answer is through the buying power the answer is through the buying power reduction< reduction or what is called the buying reduction or what is called the buying power< power effect right so this buying power power effect right so this buying power effect< effect is basically the margin the cash effect is basically the margin the cash that< that you have to put up to put on this that you have to put up to put on this position position position right< right so this is the amount that's right so this is the amount that's calculated< calculated by your broker based on what calculated by your broker based on what they< they think based on their calculation they think based on their calculation that< that is the risk the likely Max risk that is the risk the likely Max risk that< that can happen when you put on this that can happen when you put on this trade< trade so this is actually equal to two trade so this is actually equal to two standard< standard deviations right so if you can standard deviations right so if you can see< see this order ticket down here since see this order ticket down here since the< the back slot is 17 440 well this is the the back slot is 17 440 well this is the potential< potential Max loss so potentially could potential Max loss so potentially could you< you reach this yes possibly yes but you reach this yes possibly yes but probability< probability wise is very highly unlikely probability wise is very highly unlikely right< right because remember you have a time right because remember you have a time frame< frame right the time frame is around 45 frame right the time frame is around 45 to< to 60 days the chances of it going to to 60 days the chances of it going to zero< zero right you only lose this max amount zero right you only lose this max amount it< it goes to zero in the next 45 to 60 it goes to zero in the next 45 to 60 days< days if it really does then I think we days if it really does then I think we have< have much more to worry about than this have much more to worry about than this amount< amount down here because the economy amount down here because the economy probably< probably has just collapsed right if probably has just collapsed right if you're< you're talking about index ETF right you're talking about index ETF right market< market index ETFs so this is how you market index ETFs so this is how you want< want to calculate your risk so as you want to calculate your risk so as you can< can see this is for the MRI for the M can see this is for the MRI for the M run< run will one put ratio spread the buying run will one put ratio spread the buying power< power effect is already 2 000 plus which power effect is already 2 000 plus which means< means to say the account size which you means to say the account size which you want< want to have on is roughly around 40 to want to have on is roughly around 40 to around< around 50k if you want to have around a around 50k if you want to have around a five< five percent allocation but you know you five percent allocation but you know you can< can probably push it to have a 10 can probably push it to have a 10 allocation< allocation you know by 25 allocation you know by 25 000< 000 account right but just remember that 000 account right but just remember that the< the more you reach the more uh amount the more you reach the more uh amount that< that you can potentially lose as well that you can potentially lose as well whenever< whenever you hit the loser so this is whenever you hit the loser so this is very< very important to understand as you can very important to understand as you can see< see the XSP is even bigger so this is see the XSP is even bigger so this is where< where you probably need a six figures where you probably need a six figures account< account probably at least a hundred account probably at least a hundred thousand< thousand dollars so the whole idea down thousand dollars so the whole idea down here< here is that you want to put on small here is that you want to put on small position< position sizes each time so the larger position sizes each time so the larger account< account you can always put on like one account you can always put on like one percent< percent but if your account is not that percent but if your account is not that big< big you can go by five percent but the big you can go by five percent but the most< most you want to have is up to 10 most you want to have is up to 10 maximum< maximum trades of five percent because maximum trades of five percent because the< the rule down here is that you do not the rule down here is that you do not want< want to go past the 50 want to go past the 50 Capital< Capital allocation Mark right so let's Capital allocation Mark right so let's say< say if you have a let's say if you have say if you have a let's say if you have a< a fifty thousand dollars account so the a fifty thousand dollars account so the most< most you want to allocate your capital most you want to allocate your capital on< on any of the trades down here let's say on any of the trades down here let's say will< will be only up to twenty five thousand will be only up to twenty five thousand dollars< dollars and you want to keep the other dollars and you want to keep the other twenty< twenty five thousand dollars free twenty five thousand dollars free because< because firstly because firstly your< your buying power effect can increase as your buying power effect can increase as the< the market crashes right in the the market crashes right in the volatility< volatility increases your buying power volatility increases your buying power will< will increase so when you put on you may will increase so when you put on you may think< think that the the volatility or rather think that the the volatility or rather the< the buying power effect is only about the buying power effect is only about two< two thousand four hundred dollars but as two thousand four hundred dollars but as the< the market crashes this 2400 will start the market crashes this 2400 will start to< to increase maybe it increases to 2 800 to increase maybe it increases to 2 800 or< or maybe even to three thousand dollars or maybe even to three thousand dollars so< so that is why you need to have enough so that is why you need to have enough Capital< Capital to help to supplement this Capital to help to supplement this increase< increase in the buying power effect in increase in the buying power effect in case< case right it does increase case right it does increase especially< especially during volatile times the especially during volatile times the other< other thing is that you want to keep other thing is that you want to keep some< some spare bullet as well so that you some spare bullet as well so that you can< can fight back in case you have some can fight back in case you have some losses< losses right so never want to risk so losses right so never want to risk so much< much in one trade all at one goal so much in one trade all at one goal so this< this is very important especially if you this is very important especially if you want< want to put on trades like the put ratio want to put on trades like the put ratio spread< spread which is an undefined risk trade spread which is an undefined risk trade all< all right guys so let's go to some all right guys so let's go to some takeaways< takeaways so first of all the put ratio takeaways so first of all the put ratio spread< spread is a neutral to bullish strategy spread is a neutral to bullish strategy that< that has a very high probability 80 that has a very high probability 80 probably< probably a profit if you put the short probably a profit if you put the short strike< strike and the expected move number and strike and the expected move number and then< then the pull ratio spread consists of a then the pull ratio spread consists of a short< short put and then you have the embedded short put and then you have the embedded long< long put spread so it's a very flexible long put spread so it's a very flexible right< right kind of a strategy and you can right kind of a strategy and you can manipulate< manipulate the long put spread to suit manipulate the long put spread to suit your< your view of the market next is that your view of the market next is that it's< it's a very slow spread as mentioned so it's a very slow spread as mentioned so that< that is why you want to hold it all the that is why you want to hold it all the way< way to expression so that you can way to expression so that you can potentially< potentially reach the max profit and potentially reach the max profit and that< that is why if you're going to hold the that is why if you're going to hold the expression< expression we only want to trade on uh expression we only want to trade on uh you< you know the index ETFs that has you know the index ETFs that has European< European style options that you do not European style options that you do not have< have any early assignment and That is have any early assignment and That is this< this five index options at the moment this five index options at the moment and< and finally you do not want to reach and finally you do not want to reach more< more than one to five percent per trade more than one to five percent per trade and< and you measure the risk using the and you measure the risk using the buying< buying power reduction or the buying buying power reduction or the buying power< power effect all right guys so that's it power effect all right guys so that's it for< for this video I hope you found this for this video I hope you found this video< video really helpful and give you some video really helpful and give you some idea< idea to put on the put ratio spread for idea to put on the put ratio spread for yourself< yourself and it has I appreciate if you yourself and it has I appreciate if you give< give me a thumbs up and also subscribe give me a thumbs up and also subscribe to< to my channel as well and as always to my channel as well and as always thank< thank you for watching I appreciate your thank you for watching I appreciate your

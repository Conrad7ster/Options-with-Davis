90 so< so what i'm saying is that you can buy so. what i'm saying is that you can buy at< at this price 107. 90 at this price 107.

90 and< and then sell it again at this same and then sell it again at this same price< price and then still make money price and then still make money right< right so you might be wondering how it's right so you might be wondering how it's done< done well you can do this by using the done well you can do this by using the options< options wheel strategy right and i options wheel strategy right and i coined< coined this the ultimate income coined this the ultimate income generation< generation machine because that's what generation machine because that's what you're< you're really doing with this strategy you're really doing with this strategy this< this is a premium selling strategy where this is a premium selling strategy where you're< you're selling options so you can keep you're selling options so you can keep selling< selling this over and over again to selling this over and over again to collect< collect this premium okay so here's how collect this premium okay so here's how the< the options wheel strategy work so we the options wheel strategy work so we always< always start off by selling a put option always start off by selling a put option with< with the intention to buy a hundred with the intention to buy a hundred shares< shares so this is what is called a cash shares so this is what is called a cash secure< secure output now i've created an secure output now i've created an extensive< extensive video all about this so if you extensive video all about this so if you want< want to go and watch it just go ahead to want to go and watch it just go ahead to my< my channel and you can see the videos on my channel and you can see the videos on cache< cache output but basically when you sell cache output but basically when you sell a< a put option you have the obligation to a put option you have the obligation to buy< buy 100 shares of the underlying stock buy 100 shares of the underlying stock if< if you get exercise so for example if we if you get exercise so for example if we sold< sold a put option sold a put option at< at the strike price of let's say fifty at the strike price of let's say fifty dollars dollars dollars and< and if the stock closes and if the stock closes below< below fifty dollars at expiration date below fifty dollars at expiration date then< then you have the obligation to buy a then you have the obligation to buy a hundred< hundred shares at this 50 price hundred shares at this 50 price all< all right so once you are already long all right so once you are already long this< this 100 shares the next step is to then this 100 shares the next step is to then sell< sell a call option to sell away those sell a call option to sell away those shares< shares now this is what is called a shares now this is what is called a covered< covered call and again i have many covered call and again i have many videos< videos on the cover call you can just go videos on the cover call you can just go ahead< ahead to find them and watch them but ahead to find them and watch them but basically< basically when you sell a call option basically when you sell a call option you< you now have the obligation to sell a you now have the obligation to sell a hundred< hundred shares of the underlying stock hundred shares of the underlying stock if< if the option gets excised so if the option gets excised so for< for example we now have sold a covered for example we now have sold a covered call< call at fifty dollars so if the stock call at fifty dollars so if the stock was< was to go above fifty dollars and it was to go above fifty dollars and it closes< closes there at expiration then now you closes there at expiration then now you have< have the obligation to sell away the have the obligation to sell away the hundred< hundred shares hundred shares at< at fifty dollars so that is how the real at fifty dollars so that is how the real strategy< strategy works so i'm going to give you strategy works so i'm going to give you a< a few steps so step one we always start a few steps so step one we always start off< off by selling a cash secure output all off by selling a cash secure output all right< right by selling a cancer output we will right by selling. a cancer output we will receive< receive a premium and then the next step receive a premium and then the next step is< is to see whether we get a sign on the is to see whether we get a sign on the cash< cash to key output right if we are cash to key output right if we are assigned< assigned we get 100 shares but if we are assigned we get 100 shares but if we are not< not assigned and it expires worthless we not assigned and it expires worthless we just< just simply go back to step one and then just simply go back to step one and then sell< sell another cash to output and we keep sell another cash to output and we keep selling< selling the cash to output until we selling the cash to output until we finally< finally get assigned on that put all finally get assigned on that put all right< right so once we have been assigned the right so once we have been assigned the hundred< hundred shares the next step is to sell hundred shares the next step is to sell the< the covered call the covered call right< right so once you sell the cover call right so once you sell the cover call again< again we just have to wait to see again we just have to wait to see whether< whether the cover call gets assigned and whether the cover call gets assigned and our< our shares get called away our shares get called away if< if our covered call does not get if our covered call does not get assigned< assigned all we have to do is just keep assigned all we have to do is just keep selling< selling another cover call and we keep selling another cover call and we keep doing< doing this until the shares get caught doing this until the shares get caught away< away that means our call options get away that means our call options get exercise exercise exercise so< so as you can see this is why it's so as you can see this is why it's called< called the wheel strategy because we are called the wheel strategy because we are just< just doing the same things over and over just doing the same things over and over again< again to generate income right over time again to generate income right over time so< so i want to give you a visual so i want to give you a visual illustration< illustration so you can see illustration so you can see exactly< exactly how it works so let's say for exactly how it works so let's say for example< example you know we want to sell a cash example you know we want to sell a cash output< output at a hundred and twelve dollars output at a hundred and twelve dollars so< so this is the strike price that we want so this is the strike price that we want to< to sell it so when we sell this cash to to sell it so when we sell this cash to key< key output let's say we receive two key output let's say we receive two dollars< dollars fifty cents for it right in dollars fifty cents for it right in premium< premium uh this is 250 dollars into our premium uh this is 250 dollars into our account account account now< now the next step is simply to wait to now the next step is simply to wait to see< see where it expires right is it expired see where it expires right is it expired does< does it expire worthless or do we get a does it expire worthless or do we get a sign< sign on it so let's say sign on it so let's say the< the market comes down below our cash the market comes down below our cash secure< secure output strike price and at this secure output strike price and at this point< point in time we are now assigned so we point in time we are now assigned so we are< are assigned we are long 100 shares at are assigned we are long 100 shares at 112 112 112 so< so what is the next step it is to sell a so what is the next step it is to sell a covered< covered call so we sell the cover call covered call so we sell the cover call at< at the price where we long 100 shares at at the price where we long 100 shares at so< so again so again by< by selling this cover call we receive by selling this cover call we receive another< another premium so let's say we receive another premium so let's say we receive 2. 50< 2.

50 for this so it is 250 dollars so at 2. 50 for this so it is 250 dollars so at this< this point in time we already collected this point in time we already collected 500 500 500 and< and all we have done is just buy the and all we have done is just buy the shares< shares at 112 the stock hasn't even shares at 112 the stock hasn't even moved< moved in our direction yet and we are moved in our direction yet and we are already< already collecting 500 for that so the already collecting 500 for that so the next< next step is just to simply wait to see next step is just to simply wait to see if< if the stock goes up if the stock goes up to< to get our uh shares assigned have it to get our uh shares assigned have it called< called away or if it expires worthless called away or if it expires worthless then< then we sell another cover call then we sell another cover call so< so let's say on this date the so let's say on this date the option< option expires and the stock is above option expires and the stock is above our< our strike price so at this point our our strike price so at this point our cover< cover call is assigned and our shares cover call is assigned and our shares are< are called away so at this point of time are called away so at this point of time we< we no longer have the hundred shares so we no longer have the hundred shares so we< we no longer have a position so what we we no longer have a position so what we have< have to do is simply sell another caster have to do is simply sell another caster output< output so again we sell the cash output output so again we sell the cash output and< and let's say again we receive two and let's say again we receive two dollars< dollars fifty cents for it so by this dollars fifty cents for it so by this time< time we have now collected time we have now collected three< three of this two dollars fifty cents so three of this two dollars fifty cents so that< that is a total of 750 that is a total of 750 so< so then we wait and see whether we get so then we wait and see whether we get assigned< assigned so in this case the market did assigned so in this case the market did come< come down right and then we have been come down right and then we have been assigned< assigned another 100 shares right so now assigned another 100 shares right so now we< we are long hundred shares again at 112 we are long hundred shares again at 112 so< so now that we are long hundred shares so now that we are long hundred shares what< what do we do next right you know the what do we do next. right you know the drill< drill we just simply sell another cover drill we just simply sell another cover call< call and again we sell the same strike call and again we sell the same strike price< price and we collect two dollars and price and we collect two dollars and fifty< fifty cents so we have now collected a fifty cents so we have now collected a thousand< thousand dollars in premium just by thousand dollars in premium just by selling< selling the cash secure pool and the selling the cash secure pool and the covered< covered car covered car so< so let's say on this date the stock uh so let's say on this date the stock uh finally< finally is above 112 and our cover call finally is above 112 and our cover call expires expires expires this< this is our expiration date so we are this is our expiration date so we are now< now assigned and our cover call now assigned and our cover call our< our shares have now been called away our shares have now been called away right< right so at this point in time again we right so at this point in time again we have< have no more positions so we just rinse have no more positions so we just rinse and< and repeat so we sell the cash output and repeat so we sell the cash output again< again to initiate the wheel all over again to initiate the wheel all over again< again so as you can see this is again so as you can see this is really< really like an income generating machine really like an income generating machine you're< you're just selling this uh cash secure you're just selling this uh cash secure put< put and this covered call to keep put and this covered call to keep collecting< collecting this premium collecting this premium now< now you might be asking you know davis now you might be asking you know davis can< can you actually sell the cover call at can you actually sell the cover call at say< say 116 or 120 say 116 or 120 and< and the answer is definitely yes right and the answer is definitely yes right you< you can sell the covered call anywhere you can sell the covered call anywhere you< you want so if you were to sell at 116 you want so if you were to sell at 116 and< and the market was to close above this and the market was to close above this strike< strike price at expiration then it means strike price at expiration then it means not< not only did you collect all this not only did you collect all this premium< premium but you also gain a capital gain premium but you also gain a capital gain of< of four dollars per share of four dollars per share since< since you have longed at 112 since you have longed at 112 and< and then your shares get called 116.

so and then your shares get called 116. so this< this is 400 in total four hundred shares this is 400 in total four hundred shares so< so you receive a thousand dollars in so you receive a thousand dollars in terms< terms of premium and you receive four terms of premium and you receive four hundred< hundred dollars in terms of capital hundred dollars in terms of capital gains< gains from your stock now you might be gains from your stock now you might be wondering< wondering you know this options view wondering you know this options view strategy< strategy sounds a little too good to be strategy sounds a little too good to be true< true are there any risk and yes there true are there any risk and yes there are< are some risks and you want to be aware are some risks and you want to be aware of< of it now the biggest risk with this of it now the biggest risk with this options< options real strategy is that you options real strategy is that you sell< sell the classical put all right and sell the classical put all right and then< then you get assigned on it and then the then you get assigned on it and then the stock< stock never goes up stock never goes up never< never goes back up to the price where never goes back up to the price where you< you bought the stock at right and you bought the stock at right and imagine< imagine if the stock just keeps going imagine if the stock just keeps going all< all the way down so this is a big risk all the way down so this is a big risk because< because by then you will be long 100 because by then you will be long 100 shares< shares which is shares which is 13< 13 600 13 600 and< and then the premium which you have and then the premium which you have received< received for selling this would not even received for selling this would not even come< come close to covering the amount which come close to covering the amount which you< you have put into the stock so if it you have put into the stock so if it takes< takes forever to takes forever to finally< finally go back up then your money is finally go back up then your money is actually< actually stuck in this stock right and actually stuck in this stock right and if< if it never goes back up then you are in if it never goes back up then you are in a< a loss so how do you mitigate this risk a loss so how do you mitigate this risk how< how do you make this optional wheel how do you make this optional wheel strategy< strategy a little bit safer so i'm gonna strategy a little bit safer so i'm gonna share< share with you a few tips on how you can share with you a few tips on how you can make< make the options real strategies safer make the options real strategies safer by< by the way if you're enjoying this video by the way if you're enjoying this video so< so far do subscribe and hit the thumbs so far do subscribe and hit the thumbs up< up button so i can create more videos up button so i can create more videos like< like this for you in the future all like this for you in the future all right< right back to the video so the first tip right back to the video so the first tip is< is to ensure that you have enough funds is to ensure that you have enough funds to< to get assigned 100 shares right so if to get assigned 100 shares right so if the< the stock is 30 dollars then a hundred the stock is 30 dollars then a hundred shares< shares would mean that you need three shares would mean that you need three thousand< thousand dollars to fulfill this uh thousand dollars to fulfill this uh purchase< purchase of the hundred stock now there purchase of the hundred stock now there are< are some people who maybe only have a are some people who maybe only have a thousand< thousand five hundred dollars in their thousand five hundred dollars in their trading< trading account trading account and< and then they still go ahead to you know and then they still go ahead to you know do< do the wheels option strategy do the wheels option strategy on< on a stock that is 30 on a stock that is 30 so< so what happens is that they are trying so what happens is that they are trying to< to utilize margin that means they to utilize margin that means they trade< trade on margin trade on margin you< you can't do that but what happens is you can't do that but what happens is that< that when you're on margin what actually that when you're on margin what actually is< is happening is that you are borrowing is happening is that you are borrowing the< the other fifty percent the other the other fifty percent the other thousand< thousand five hundred dollars from the thousand five hundred dollars from the broker< broker and when the broker lends you broker and when the broker lends you this< this money they actually charge you an this money they actually charge you an interest< interest rate so as you can see this is interest rate so as you can see this is the< the interest rate depending on your the interest rate depending on your account< account size so if your account size is account size so if your account size is under< under 10 000 under 10 000 you'll< you'll be charged a pretty hefty 11 you'll be charged a pretty hefty 11 on< on the borrowed money so if you know if on the borrowed money so if you know if the< the stock takes a very long time to the stock takes a very long time to finally< finally recover back to the price which finally recover back to the price which you< you bought it at then this 11 can really you bought it at then this 11 can really amount< amount to quite a bit because this amount to quite a bit because this interest< interest down here is accrued on a daily interest down here is accrued on a daily basis< basis so you're actually being charged a basis so you're actually being charged a financially< financially charged a margin charge financially charged a margin charge every< every single day that you're holding on every single day that you're holding on to< to the stock so if the stock takes let's to the stock so if the stock takes let's say< say years to finally go back up to your say years to finally go back up to your strike< strike price to the price which you strike price to the price which you bought< bought at then you'll be charged quite a bought at then you'll be charged quite a lot< lot of money by the broker right lot of money by the broker right and< and then your premium which you receive and then your premium which you receive may< may not even be enough to cover this may not even be enough to cover this margin< margin charge so as always for myself margin charge so as always for myself i< i always prefer to have the full cash to i always prefer to have the full cash to be< be assigned 100 shares so if the 100 be assigned 100 shares so if the 100 shares< shares is gonna cost three thousand shares is gonna cost three thousand dollars< dollars i'm going to ensure that three dollars i'm going to ensure that three thousand< thousand dollars before you know i go thousand dollars before you know i go ahead< ahead to do the options real strategy ahead to do the options real strategy now< now the next tip is to wait till the now the next tip is to wait till the stock< stock is oversold before selling the stock is oversold before selling the cash< cash secure output so what do i mean cash secure output so what do i mean so< so overbought or oversold is basically so overbought or oversold is basically an< an indication uh by indicators so there an indication uh by indicators so there are< are indicators like this is the are indicators like this is the stochastic< stochastic oscillator so what it does is stochastic oscillator so what it does is that< that it tracks whether the stock is that it tracks whether the stock is overbought< overbought or oversold so you can see overbought or oversold so you can see that< that there are there's this blue that there are there's this blue squiggly< squiggly line down here as well as a two squiggly line down here as well as a two purple< purple lines so if the blue line was to purple lines so if the blue line was to go< go above this purple line it would go above this purple line it would indicate< indicate that the market is overbought indicate that the market is overbought and< and if it goes below this line it will and if it goes below this line it will indicate< indicate that it's oversold now what we indicate that it's oversold now what we want< want to ideally do is sell the cash want to ideally do is sell the cash secure< secure output only when the market is secure output only when the market is oversold< oversold so this way we know that if the oversold so this way we know that if the market< market is oversold there's a higher market is oversold there's a higher chance< chance for the market to rebound back up chance for the market to rebound back up uh< uh soon after right so yes you can see uh soon after right so yes you can see there< there are a number of instances where there are a number of instances where the< the indicator stochastic says that it is the indicator stochastic says that it is oversold oversold oversold and< and then the market subsequently goes and then the market subsequently goes back< back up you can see this is oversold back up you can see this is oversold market< market goes back up market goes back up and< and that time when it's oversold again and that time when it's oversold again market< market goes back up market goes back up and< and at times oversold and the market and at times oversold and the market goes< goes back up right now one thing to goes back up right now one thing to understand< understand is that this is not understand is that this is not 100 100 100 working< working all the time right it's not like working all the time right it's not like every< every time the indicator every time the indicator is< is showing an oversold right indication is showing an oversold right indication that< that the market will always bounce back that the market will always bounce back up up up the< the thing is that the thing is that there< there is a higher probability that it there is a higher probability that it will< will bounce back up then it will go back will bounce back up then it will go back down< down so it's much better to sell a down so it's much better to sell a cashier< cashier car put when it's oversold than cashier car put when it's oversold than if< if let's say the market is overbought if let's say the market is overbought right< right so if the market is overbought right so if the market is overbought it< it means that there's a higher chance it means that there's a higher chance the< the market will subsequently go back the market will subsequently go back down< down rather than go back up so if you're down rather than go back up so if you're selling< selling a cash to kill put and let's say selling a cash to kill put and let's say you're< you're going to get a sign on the shares you're going to get a sign on the shares you< you want ideally the market to go up you want ideally the market to go up after< after that right and the better way for after that right and the better way for you< you to do that is when the market is you to do that is when the market is oversold< oversold rather than when it's oversold rather than when it's overbought< overbought so we want to be overbought so we want to be more< more strategic and smarter when we are more strategic and smarter when we are trying< trying to sell our cash secure output trying to sell our cash secure output the< the next tip is to sell the cash took the next tip is to sell the cash took output< output below a support area now if output below a support area now if you're< you're not familiar what a support area you're not familiar what a support area is< is or support level is it basically just is or support level is it basically just is< is placed on a chart where you know the is placed on a chart where you know the market< market has difficulty going below so as market has difficulty going below so as you< you can see this is the previous low so you can see this is the previous low so you< you were to just draw a line down here you were to just draw a line down here right right right you< you can see that the market has trouble you can see that the market has trouble trying< trying to go below this right it tried trying to go below this right it tried to< to break below this low but then it to break below this low but then it couldn't< couldn't and then it subsequently goes couldn't and then it subsequently goes back< back up so these are places that you back up so these are places that you want< want to look out for on the chart as want to look out for on the chart as well< well to see where it could be a good well to see where it could be a good level< level to sell the cash secure output level to sell the cash secure output right< right to initiate the options real right to initiate the options real strategy strategy strategy so< so here's another place so here's another place right< right you can see that this is a right you can see that this is a resistance< resistance you can see the price resistance you can see the price had< had difficulty trying to break up had difficulty trying to break up trying< trying to break out of this area and trying to break out of this area and finally< finally it broke out and then this finally it broke out and then this resistance< resistance area sort of became a support resistance area sort of became a support area< area you can see that the price went up area you can see that the price went up and< and then it started to bounce off this and then it started to bounce off this quite< quite a number of times so this can be a quite a number. of times so this can be a good< good area to say that hey you know good area to say that hey you know there's< there's some support here i want to sell there's some support here i want to sell my< my cash secure output below this area my cash secure output below this area so so so we< we can see on the right hand chart this we can see on the right hand chart this is< is slightly uh oversold is going to is slightly uh oversold is going to oversold< oversold territory so what we can do is oversold territory so what we can do is that< that we can identify this as a support that we can identify this as a support area< area and then we could sell a cash area and then we could sell a cash secure< secure output below this area maybe you secure output below this area maybe you can< can sell at 163 maybe even lower 160 can sell at 163 maybe even lower 160 depending< depending on how much premium which can depending on how much premium which can get< get so as you can see this is much get so as you can see this is much smarter< smarter than if you were to just sell a smarter than if you were to just sell a cashier< cashier carpool anywhere you want now cashier carpool anywhere you want now the< the next tip is to avoid choosing stocks the next tip is to avoid choosing stocks just< just for the high premiums and to choose just for the high premiums and to choose only< only fundamentally good stocks so there only fundamentally good stocks so there are< are a lot of stocks out there that gives are a lot of stocks out there that gives very< very high premiums because they are very very high premiums because they are very high< high implied volatility and there are a high implied volatility and there are a lot< lot of traders they are trading this lot of traders they are trading this sort< sort of stocks because sort of stocks because if< if they give you a juicy premium if they give you a juicy premium then< then it means that you can make much then it means that you can make much more< more on your more on your uh< uh covered calls and as well as your uh covered calls and as well as your cash< cash output now the problem with this cash output now the problem with this kind< kind of stocks is that they may not kind of stocks is that they may not necessarily< necessarily be a fundamentally good necessarily be a fundamentally good stock< stock that means that it could be high stock that means that it could be high volatility< volatility gives you high premium but volatility gives you high premium but the< the stock could not go up in the long the stock could not go up in the long term< term right so for example if you take a term right so for example if you take a look< look at these two companies right this look at these two companies right this is< is the income statement for company okay is the income statement for company okay let's< let's say this company a this is company let's say this company a this is company b b b so< so if you were to take a look at company so if you were to take a look at company a< a the revenue is the blue bar so you can a the revenue is the blue bar so you can see< see that it's pretty inconsistent see that it's pretty inconsistent certain< certain years is you know high certain certain years is you know high certain years< years is low basically it's not years is low basically it's not increasing< increasing at a very nice increasing at a very nice rate< rate which we want and you can see that rate which we want and you can see that the< the bar in yellow indicates that it's the bar in yellow indicates that it's not< not making money at all right the net not making money at all right the net income< income is negative for the past five income is negative for the past five years< years it's not making money whereas on years it's not making money whereas on this< this side of the this side of the this< this company company b you can see that this company company b you can see that the< the revenue is increasing over time and the revenue is increasing over time and the< the net income is positive as well it the net income is positive as well it has< has been increasing over the past five has been increasing over the past five years< years so if you were to do the options years so if you were to do the options real< real strategy would you rather do on real strategy would you rather do on company< company a or would you rather do on company a or would you rather do on company< company b right you definitely want to company b right you definitely want to do< do on company b because if a company is do on company b because if a company is making< making money and it's continually making making money and it's continually making money< money over uh the number of years then money over uh the number of years then you< you know that it has a good chance of you know that it has a good chance of the< the stock always going up in the long the stock always going up in the long term< term so what is this two companies as term so what is this two companies as you< you can see company a is gamestop and you can see company a is gamestop and company< company b is google company b is google right< right so you see a lot of traders there right so you see a lot of traders there they< they are actually trading gamestop they are actually trading gamestop because< because it's giving a very high premium because it's giving a very high premium now< now you can definitely trade that but if now you can definitely trade that but if you< you want to do the options real strategy you want to do the options real strategy you< you ultimately want to go do it on a you ultimately want to go do it on a stock< stock where the market will go up in the stock where the market will go up in the long< long term because long term because if< if it doesn't go up and your cash secure if it doesn't go up and your cash secure put< put or the place where you buy the stock put or the place where you buy the stock at< at the stock doesn't go back to that at the stock doesn't go back to that point< point then you will not be making any point then you will not be making any money< money on the options build strategy money on the options build strategy right< right so it will be safer to do on right so it will be safer to do on fundamentally< fundamentally good stocks now the next fundamentally good stocks now the next tip< tip will be to choose broad-based index tip will be to choose broad-based index etfs< etfs right like the iwm which is the etfs right like the iwm which is the russell< russell 2000 you have the triple q's russell 2000 you have the triple q's spiders< spiders em xlf and etc right so the spiders em xlf and etc right so the thing< thing with individual stocks is that it thing with individual stocks is that it can< can easily can easily be< be affected by be affected by many< many things that happen right let's say many things that happen right let's say for< for example if the stock changes its ceo for example if the stock changes its ceo or< or something happening with the company or something happening with the company they< they change the business direction the they change the business direction the stock< stock can really be affected it can stock can really be affected it can crash< crash right but whereas for an etf it crash right but whereas for an etf it holds< holds a basket of stocks so when it has holds a basket of stocks so when it has a< a basket of stocks the chances of it a basket of stocks the chances of it actually< actually going to zero is lesser for actually going to zero is lesser for example< example back in 2008 there was this two example back in 2008 there was this two stocks< stocks bastards as well as lehman stocks bastards as well as lehman brothers< brothers right they went bankrupt during brothers right they went bankrupt during the< the 2008 financial crisis right and if the 2008 financial crisis right and if you< you had did the options view strategy on you had did the options view strategy on both< both of them then said to say that you both of them then said to say that you would< would have lost all your money but if would have lost all your money but if you< you do the you do the broad-based< broad-based index like all of these etfs broad-based index like all of these etfs even< even though that during the 2008 even though that during the 2008 financial< financial crisis the market did go down financial crisis the market did go down but< but the ets eventually did recover right but the ets eventually did recover right so< so if you did the options real strategy so if you did the options real strategy on< on them you would eventually make money on them you would eventually make money right< right so for example right so for example this< this is the etf the xlf etf it tracks this is the etf the xlf etf it tracks all< all the financial stocks in the market all the financial stocks in the market so< so back then so back then 2008< 2008 bastance and lehman brothers if i'm 2008 bastance and lehman brothers if i'm not< not wrong they were also included in not wrong they were also included in this< this etf they were part of this etf so this etf they were part of this etf so while< while it did crash right it ultimately while it did crash right it ultimately did< did go back up again did go back up again whereas< whereas for bastions and lehman brothers whereas for bastions and lehman brothers they< they went to zero so if you want it to they went to zero so if you want it to be< be safer you want to trade the options be safer you want to trade the options real< real strategy real strategy in< in a safer way then it would be probably in a safer way then it would be probably better< better to do it on etf now you can see better to do it on etf now you can see that that that if< if you were to sell a cash secure put if you were to sell a cash secure put let's< let's say right at the high let's say right at the high right< right around 2007 right around 2007 you< you will see that it takes quite a long you will see that it takes quite a long time< time before the market goes back up time before the market goes back up again< again right from this point of time when again right from this point of time when the< the market crashed all the way to where the market crashed all the way to where it< it finally recovered it finally recovered it< it took over 10 years right it took over it took over 10 years right it took over 10< 10 years so one way to mitigate this 10 years so one way to mitigate this risk risk risk is< is instead is to split your entries into is instead is to split your entries into tranches< tranches and that is the final tip for tranches and that is the final tip for making< making the options real strategies safer making the options real strategies safer so< so what do i mean by splitting them into so what do i mean by splitting them into tranches tranches tranches so< so basically let's say you have enough so basically let's say you have enough cash< cash to sell three cash flow output cash to sell three cash flow output let's< let's say at the thirty dollars right so let's say at the thirty dollars right so that< that means you need to have a capital of that means you need to have a capital of nine< nine thousand dollars so let's say nine thousand dollars so let's say instead< instead of just selling three cash to instead of just selling three cash to kill< kill put all at this one level you split kill put all at this one level you split them< them up into three different levels so them up into three different levels so maybe< maybe you could sell one at the 30 level maybe you could sell one at the 30 level sell< sell another one at 25 71 at 20 so this sell another one at 25 71 at 20 so this way< way if the market was to really go down way if the market was to really go down right right right you< you would be able to average down your you would be able to average down your price< price so it makes it easier for you to price so it makes it easier for you to you< you know break even on your stock and you know break even on your stock and then< then make money on all the premiums then make money on all the premiums which< which you sold right all the cash output which you sold right all the cash output as< as well as the covered call so this way as well as the covered call so this way it's< it's much easier to break above 25 so if it's much easier to break above 25 so if you< you were to you know long 100 shares at you were to you know long 100 shares at each< each of this level your average would be each of this level your average would be 25 25 25 this< this would be much easier for it to go this would be much easier for it to go above< above 25 than it is you know to go above above 25 than it is you know to go above 30< 30 dollars okay that's it for me guys i 30 dollars okay that's it for me guys i hope< hope you enjoyed this video if you have hope you enjoyed this video if you have please< please

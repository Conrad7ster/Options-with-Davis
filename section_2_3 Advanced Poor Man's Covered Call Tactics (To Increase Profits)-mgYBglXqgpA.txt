Language: en all< all right all righty so today we're all right all righty so today we're going< going to continue the topic on the poor going to continue the topic on the poor man's< man's cover call and if you haven't man's cover call and if you haven't watched< watched the previous video which i've watched the previous video which i've created< created where i share with you the core created where i share with you the core fundamentals< fundamentals of the appointments cover fundamentals of the appointments cover call< call and how to set it up please go call and how to set it up please go ahead< ahead and watch that first right you can ahead and watch that first right you can click< click it the link on the top right hand click it the link on the top right hand corner< corner of this video but in this video corner of this video but in this video i'm< i'm going to share with you three i'm going to share with you three advanced< advanced poor man's cover call tactics advanced poor man's cover call tactics that< that you can use to increase your that you can use to increase your profits< profits and this is something that you profits and this is something that you cannot< cannot see anywhere else you cannot see cannot see anywhere else you cannot see in< in any other youtube videos because this in any other youtube videos because this is< is something that i've learned from is something that i've learned from myself< myself through a lot of trial and error myself through a lot of trial and error and< and also during my time when i was at and also during my time when i was at the< the proprietary trading firm the proprietary trading firm while< while i was professionally training for while i was professionally training for the< the firm right so the very first tactic the firm right so the very first tactic is< is what i call the extrinsic value is what i call the extrinsic value manipulation< manipulation all right so first of all manipulation all right so first of all let's< let's just have a quick recap on what let's just have a quick recap on what the< the per mass cover call is so the the per mass cover call is so the permanent< permanent cover call consists of two permanent cover call consists of two things< things you have the long call option things you have the long call option and< and what we want to do for this is to and what we want to do for this is to buy< buy the deep in the money call and then buy the deep in the money call and then we< we sell the call option which is a short we sell the call option which is a short call< call option which is the covered call call option which is the covered call right< right so extrinsic value manipulation is right so extrinsic value manipulation is basically< basically so for our long call we want basically so for our long call we want to< to pay as little extrinsic value as to pay as little extrinsic value as possible< possible and for our short call we want possible and for our short call we want to< to cover as much of the extrinsic value to cover as much of the extrinsic value of< of the long call as possible so here's of the long call as possible so here's what< what i mean all right so the long call what i mean all right so the long call option option option uh< uh deep in the money call right we have uh deep in the money call right we have uh< uh two components to its value right we uh two components to its value right we have< have the extrinsic value and we have the have the extrinsic value and we have the intrinsic< intrinsic value and then for the short intrinsic value and then for the short call< call option which is the cover call we call option which is the cover call we are< are only basically going to sell the out are only basically going to sell the out of< of the money call option so this is 100 of the money call option so this is 100 extrinsic< extrinsic value alright so down here we extrinsic value alright so down here we are< are paying for the extrinsic value here are paying for the extrinsic value here we< we are receiving premium we are receiving premium right< right in terms of extrinsic value right right in terms of extrinsic value right so< so extrinsic value basically we already so extrinsic value basically we already know< know goes to zero when the x option know goes to zero when the x option expires< expires so as much as possible we're expires so as much as possible we're going< going to buy a very little extrinsic going to buy a very little extrinsic value< value right so the idea is here value right so the idea is here the< the idea is that we want this extrinsic the idea is that we want this extrinsic value< value that we receive value that we receive for< for selling our cover call to fully for selling our cover call to fully negate< negate the cost of purchasing this long negate the cost of purchasing this long call< call option uh the extrinsic value call option uh the extrinsic value portion< portion so let's say if we have um portion so let's say if we have um paid< paid let's say one dollar for this uh paid let's say one dollar for this uh options< options extrinsic value ideally we want options extrinsic value ideally we want to< to collect about one dollar right or as to collect about one dollar right or as close< close to a dollar as possible so that close to a dollar as possible so that this< this two will cancel each other out and this two will cancel each other out and that< that means we don't pay anything for that means we don't pay anything for extrinsic< extrinsic value right instead we will extrinsic value right instead we will only< only be paying a full value which is the only be paying a full value which is the intrinsic< intrinsic value right we want to pay intrinsic value right we want to pay only< only intrinsic value because intrinsic only intrinsic value because intrinsic value< value basically is the core value of the value basically is the core value of the option< option all right so let's take a look at option all right so let's take a look at the< the option chain so i'll share with you the option chain so i'll share with you my< my ideas and also what are my thinking my ideas and also what are my thinking process< process is when i'm selecting the process is when i'm selecting the strikes< strikes all right so first off i want strikes all right so first off i want you< you to take a look at this extrinsic you to take a look at this extrinsic column column column all< all right this green box down here is all right this green box down here is the< the extrinsic value for the the extrinsic value for the corresponding< corresponding option strike right so corresponding option strike right so first< first off i will always look at the long first off i will always look at the long call< call option call option so< so the long call option the first thing so the long call option the first thing we< we want to look out for is you know the we want to look out for is you know the days< days to expiration how many days there days to expiration how many days there is< is left to the expiration of this option is left to the expiration of this option now< now there are people out there right in now there are people out there right in the< the youtube you will see that a lot of the youtube you will see that a lot of them< them talk about you know buying 180 days them talk about you know buying 180 days or< or. so around there you know that's or so around there you know that's definitely< definitely viable definitely viable but< but what i like to do is i like to go but what i like to do is i like to go all< all the way to the furthest date all the way to the furthest date available< available i want to go for the leaps available i want to go for the leaps right< right the reason is because i want to right the reason is because i want to give< give myself more time to be right give myself more time to be right because< because what happens if let's say for because what happens if let's say for example< example you buy a 180 days example you buy a 180 days days< days to expiration uh call option and days to expiration uh call option and the< the stock actually doesn't work out the stock actually doesn't work out within< within that six months right you have within that six months right you have six< six months for it to work out so what six months for it to work out so what happens< happens then do you exercise the call happens then do you exercise the call option< option do you sell it away for a loss do option do you sell it away for a loss do you< you roll it what do you do so it becomes you roll it what do you do so it becomes more< more uh complicated then right so what i more uh complicated then right so what i prefer< prefer to do prefer to do to< to remove all the complications is to to remove all the complications is to buy< buy a longer time period buy a longer time period option< option so this way not only do i have option so this way not only do i have more< more time for the trade to work out and more time for the trade to work out and especially< especially if i am buying it on a good especially if i am buying it on a good fundamental< fundamental stock a fundamentally good fundamental stock a fundamentally good stock< stock that i know that will go up in the stock that i know that will go up in the long< long term then i have no worries right long term then i have no worries right even< even though if i'm caught in a position even though if i'm caught in a position where< where it starts to go down temporarily where it starts to go down temporarily right< right so when you have an option with a right so when you have an option with a very< very long days to expiration your theta very long days to expiration your theta decay< decay is very little right theta decay decay is very little right theta decay basically< basically is the the depreciation of basically is the the depreciation of your< your extrinsic value because as each day your extrinsic value because as each day passes< passes this extrinsic value all right passes this extrinsic value all right will< will start to decay will start to slowly will start to decay will start to slowly get< get to zero at expiration date right so get to zero at expiration date right so the< the thing with uh this theta decay is the thing with uh this theta decay is that< that it really picks up only when it that it really picks up only when it gets< gets closer to the expiration date right gets closer to the expiration date right so< so as if it's very far out as far away so as if it's very far out as far away as< as it is right when there's many days as it is right when there's many days left< left the theta decay is actually very left the theta decay is actually very little< little so the whole idea here is because little so the whole idea here is because i< i am buying a long call option that i am buying a long call option that means< means i'm buying extrinsic value i want means i'm buying extrinsic value i want to< to have it sort of working for me right to have it sort of working for me right i< i want to slow down this decay as i want to slow down this decay as possible< possible and slow down this depreciation possible and slow down this depreciation as< as much as possible and that is to go as much as possible and that is to go for< for a further away for a further away days< days to expiration this way it decays days to expiration this way it decays slower< slower and at the same time i want to slower and at the same time i want to pay< pay as little as possible remember we pay as little as possible remember we want< want to pay as little extrinsic value as want to pay as little extrinsic value as possible< possible for a long call option so if possible for a long call option so if you< you were to take a look at this you were to take a look at this option< option chain down here option chain down here ideally< ideally we want to buy this option ideally we want to buy this option because< because it is only 50 cents right 50 because it is only 50 cents right 50 cents< cents is just 50 dollars per option cents is just 50 dollars per option contract< contract and 50 you can hold it for 542 contract and 50 you can hold it for 542 days< days so there is very little but we do days so there is very little but we do not< not stop there we do not say that we not stop there we do not say that we just< just go for the cheapest because you can just go for the cheapest because you can see< see this would cost you roughly about see this would cost you roughly about four four four for< for seven dollars so there's about four for seven dollars so there's about four thousand< thousand seven hundred dollars so the thousand seven hundred dollars so the other< other rule which i have is that i do not other rule which i have is that i do not want< want to pay more than 50 want to pay more than 50 of< of what i would pay if i bought 100 of what i would pay if i bought 100 shares< shares of the underlying stock so what shares of the underlying stock so what is< is the current stock price right now is the current stock price right now let's< let's just take a look so without let's just take a look so without looking< looking at the stock price you can see i looking at the stock price you can see i do< do not have the stock price current do not have the stock price current billion< billion offer here we can just actually billion offer here we can just actually take< take a look at the option chain to give take a look at the option chain to give us< us an idea of where the stock price is us an idea of where the stock price is actually< actually currently trading right so you actually currently trading right so you can< can see in the gray box down here can see in the gray box down here it's< it's highlighted right this highlighter it's highlighted right this highlighter down< down here which means to say this strike down here which means to say this strike price< price 80 and 81 it is in the money and price 80 and 81 it is in the money and from< from anywhere from 82 all the way from anywhere from 82 all the way onwards< onwards right up to 92 there you can see onwards right up to 92 there you can see this< this is out of the money so we know that this is out of the money so we know that the< the current strike price or rather the the current strike price or rather the current< current stock price is somewhere in current stock price is somewhere in between< between 81 and 82. between 81 and 82.

so< so let's just give so let's just give 81 81 81 and< and 50 cents is where the current stock and 50 cents is where the current stock price< price is right now right so in one price is right now right so in one dollars< dollars and 50 cents if you were to buy dollars and 50 cents if you were to buy a< a hundred shares how much would that a hundred shares how much would that cost< cost all right that will cost you 8 cost all right that will cost you 8 150 150 150 so< so what this means is that i do not want so what this means is. that i do not want to< to pay more than 50 of this which is to pay more than 50 of this which is roughly roughly roughly 4075< 4075 dollars so i want to choose a long 4075 dollars so i want to choose a long call< call option that does not cost more than call option that does not cost more than 4075 4075 4075 so< so which of it fits our criteria well so which of it fits our criteria well the< the one that fits our criteria will be the one that fits our criteria will be these< these two options right here right these two options right here right 40< 40 and 45. so uh strike strike price of 40 and 45.

so uh strike strike price of 40< 40 is about 40 is about 42. 40< 42.

40 which is not too far off uh the 50 42. 40 which is not too far off uh the 50 mark< mark so i would also consider this mark so i would also consider this because< because you see we are paying very because you see we are. paying very little< little in terms of extrinsic value so little in terms of extrinsic value so the< the two strike price which i'm looking the two strike price which i'm looking at< at is 40 to 45.

all right now there are at is 40 to 45. all right now there are some< some people that's telling you that some people that's telling you that instead< instead of going for this deep in the instead of going for this deep in the money< money uh call options where you pay very money uh call options where you pay very little< little extrinsic uh value little extrinsic uh value they< they are telling you to go you know you they are telling you to go. you know you can< can go for at the money or even out the can go for at the money or even out the money< money right the problem with that is money right the problem with that is that< that you're actually paying in a lot of that you're actually paying in a lot of extrinsic< extrinsic value only take a look at this extrinsic value only take a look at this right< right you're paying 11.

95 for this so it right you're paying 11. 95 for this so it means< means you the market has to move above. means you the market has to move above this< this price move above 11.

35 this price move above 11. 35 in< in move in order for you to break even in move in order for you to break even on< on your on your price< price whereas for this side you can see price whereas for this side you can see that< that the extrinsic value is much lesser that the extrinsic value is much lesser so< so it's much easier for you to break so it's much easier for you to break even< even and even profit even and even profit on< on a move on the underlying stock right on a move on the underlying stock right so< so if people is telling you to you know so if people is telling you to you know you< you go ahead you can buy the cheaper you go ahead you can buy the cheaper ones< ones as you can see it's only like 13 12 ones as you can see it's only like 13 12 that< that you can buy that you can buy you< you need to realize that the stock you need to realize that the stock underlying< underlying stock has to make a bigger underlying stock has to make a bigger move< move in order for you to profit at the move in order for you to profit at the end< end so this is what you want to keep in end so this is what you want to keep in mind< mind all right so now the next thing i mind all right so now the next thing i want< want to take a look at want to take a look at right< right would be the covered call price so right would be the covered call price so let's< let's take a look at the cover call once let's take a look at the cover call once we< we have already identified the uh uh we have already identified the uh uh strike< strike price which we want to go at strike price which we want to go at roughly< roughly around 40 to 45 the next thing roughly around 40 to 45 the next thing we< we want to take a look at would be the we want to take a look at would be the covered< covered call right so this cover call covered call right so this cover call first< first we want to take a look at the first we want to take a look at the expiration< expiration date so generally i like to expiration date so generally i like to go< go for anywhere around the 30 days mark go for anywhere around the 30 days mark which< which is a very good place where you can which is a very good place where you can have< have a decent have a decent decent< decent premium at the same time you have decent premium at the same time you have a< a far enough strike price so that you a far enough strike price so that you can< can make on the intrinsic value of the can make on the intrinsic value of the option< option right so option right so there< there are some people that are saying there are some people that are saying that< that you know you can go for the weekly that you know you can go for the weekly covered< covered calls right you can sell weekly covered calls right you can sell weekly because< because you can get a higher return well because you can get a higher return well you< you can have a higher return but what you can have a higher return but what you< you want to keep in mind is that when it you want to keep in mind is that when it is< is a closer to the expiration date is a closer to the expiration date it< it means that you will have to choose it means that you will have to choose strike< strike prices that is closer to the strike prices that is closer to the current< current strike price right so most current strike price right so most likely< likely you may have to choose like 83 likely you may have to choose like 83 dollars< dollars in order for you to get a dollar dollars in order for you to get a dollar premium< premium when right with 24 days out you premium when right with 24 days out you can< can choose the 86 strike price and get can choose the 86 strike price and get about< about a dollar premium so what this about a dollar premium so what this means< means is that you've actually kept your means is that you've actually kept your intrinsic< intrinsic value gain right to just the intrinsic value gain right to just the strike< strike price which you sold the covered strike price which you sold the covered calls< calls at right so this is one thing you calls at right so this is one thing you want< want to keep in mind so for me i like a want to keep in mind so for me i like a good< good balance so anywhere around the 30 good balance so anywhere around the 30 days< days will be good so days will be good so the< the next thing you want to take a look the next thing you want to take a look at< at is the premiums that can potentially at is the premiums that can potentially help< help you offset the premiums down here help you offset the premiums down here which< which you have paid so which you have paid so if< if you are looking at this two strike if you are looking at this two strike price< price we're going to pay roughly about price we're going to pay roughly about 92< 92 cents and a dollar and 57 cents so 92 cents and a dollar and 57 cents so we're< we're going to take a look at the uh we're going to take a look at the uh extrinsic< extrinsic value down here which we can extrinsic value down here which we can sort< sort of offset that right so which other sort of offset that right so which other ones< ones that we can use to offset let me ones that we can use to offset let me just< just get a highlighter here so which are just get a highlighter here so which are the< the good candidates the good candidates but< but the good candidates will be this one but the good candidates will be this one this< this one this one this one this one and< and even this one 93 cents because it's and even this one 93 cents because it's just< just nice covers this and actually we just nice covers this and actually we can< can even go for the 82 72 sensor for two can even go for the 82 72 sensor for two cents< cents because remember this is just the cents because remember this is just the first< first covered call that we are selling first covered call that we are selling right< right so how many covered calls can we right so how many covered calls can we sell sell sell right< right we simply just take the number of right we simply just take the number of days< days of expiration all right take five days of expiration all right take five four< four two for a long call and we divided four two for a long call and we divided by< by this uh by this uh options< options uh the cover calls expiration options uh the cover calls expiration did< did so we can see it's roughly 22 days did so we can see it's roughly 22 days right< right so we have roughly 22 covered right so we have roughly 22 covered calls< calls we can sell but as a good number calls we can sell but as a good number for< for us to use i would say 50 of that for us to use i would say 50 of that because< because let's say if the market was to because let's say if the market was to go< go all the way up and it goes past your go all the way up and it goes past your your< your strike price of your cover call by your strike price of your cover call by a< a lot then maybe you might not even be a lot then maybe you might not even be able< able to roll or it doesn't expire able to roll or it doesn't expire worthless< worthless so in this case we took 10 on worthless so in this case we took 10 on the< the other hand if the market was to go the other hand if the market was to go down< down the moment you initiate the down the moment you initiate the pro-men's< pro-men's cover call position pro-men's cover call position then< then you may reach a point where the then you may reach a point where the market< market probably went until so low right market probably went until so low right the< the stock went so low that the the only the stock went so low that the the only cover< cover call that you can sell is below cover call that you can sell is below the< the entry price or your permanent cover the entry price or your permanent cover call< call which is not what you want to do call which is not what you want to do because< because if the market does shoot up then because if the market does shoot up then you're< you're going to lock yourself into a you're going to lock yourself into a loss< loss so that's not what you're going to loss so that's not what you're going to do< do so let's take a good gauge of a rough do so let's take a good gauge of a rough roughly< roughly 50 of that so that's about 10 roughly 50 of that so that's about 10 covered< covered calls so 10 cover calls even if covered calls so 10 cover calls even if you< you were to get you know 43 cents only you were to get you know 43 cents only just< just for the premium just for the premium for< for one covered call you times 10 of for one covered call you times 10 of this< this you get about four dollars so for this you get about four dollars so for those< those more than cover all this extrinsic those more than cover all this extrinsic value< value that you're paying for all right value that you're paying for all right so so so the< the next thing i want to take a look at the next thing i want to take a look at is< is delta right so the delta is delta right so the delta so< so generally for poor man's cover call i so generally for poor man's cover call i tend< tend to be a little bit more aggressive tend to be a little bit more aggressive in< in terms of my covered call selection in terms of my covered call selection compared< compared to a normal cover call as if i compared to a normal cover call as if i was< was having a hundred shares right so was having a hundred shares right so that's< that's because with 100 shares if the that's because with 100 shares if the uh< uh you know if the stock uh if your uh you know if the stock uh if your cover< cover card gets in the money your stock cover card gets in the money your stock gets< gets caught away but in this case the gets caught away but in this case the poor< poor man's cover called you don't have poor man's cover called you don't have 100< 100 shares right rather you have this 100 shares right rather you have this long< long call option so long call option has long call option so long call option has this< this extrinsic value which you're buying this extrinsic value which you're buying and< and because of this extrinsic value it's and because of this extrinsic value it's going< going to decay going to decay and< and if decay i want the market to and if decay i want the market to quickly< quickly go in my favor as quick as quickly go in my favor as quick as possible< possible so i tend to be a little bit possible so i tend to be a little bit more< more aggressive in terms of the covered more aggressive in terms of the covered call< call for the poor man's cover call so call for the poor man's cover call so this< this way i can get more premium so this way i can get more premium so anywhere< anywhere between around 15 to 25 to even anywhere between around 15 to 25 to even 30< 30 deltas would be pretty good and i 30 deltas would be pretty good and i have< have a nice distance have a nice distance right< right between the entry price which i right between the entry price which i entered< entered the promise cover call and where entered the promise cover call and where the< the cover call strike price is okay so i the cover call strike price is okay so i want< want you to take a look at the strike want you to take a look at the strike prices< prices all down here and all this prices all down here and all this extrinsic< extrinsic uh value extrinsic uh value all< all right all right and< and then tell yourself you know which is and then tell yourself you know which is the< the one that you might choose right the one that you might choose right which< which is the one you would choose right which is the one you would choose right give< give a second down here give a second down here okay< okay so have you come up with an answer okay so have you come up with an answer so< so for me most likely i would go for so for me most likely i would go for this< this 93 cents right so because 93 cents this 93 cents right so because 93 cents you< you can see it fully covers this you can see it fully covers this extrinsic< extrinsic value of this strike price so extrinsic value of this strike price so chances< chances are i would go for this right chances are i would go for this right which< which is at 40 which is at 40 strike< strike 40 strike 40 and< and then and then i< i don't mind paying a little bit more i don't mind paying a little bit more right< right slightly more than the 50 right slightly more than the 50 of< of what it take to buy a hundred shares of what it take to buy a hundred shares but< but that's fine right so because i can but that's fine right so because i can cover< cover it in just one covered call i cover it in just one covered call i wouldn't< wouldn't mind selling or rather i wouldn't mind selling or rather i wouldn't< wouldn't mind buying this strike price wouldn't mind buying this strike price right< right and i get a pretty good distance right and i get a pretty good distance away< away from the current strike price right away from the current strike price right the< the counter strike price is 87 so that the counter strike price is 87 so that gives< gives about you know six dollars in gives about you know six dollars in terms< terms of intrinsic value which is pretty terms of intrinsic value which is pretty good< good now the other thing i want you to good now the other thing i want you to take< take notes of delta is also the delta take notes of delta is also the delta can< can be used as a gauge of probability of can be used as a gauge of probability of being< being in the money right so a delta being in the money right so a delta 24< 24 just means there is a 24 chance that 24 just means there is a 24 chance that the< the market is going to be in the money the market is going to be in the money or< or rather this covered call is going to or rather this covered call is going to be< be in the money and expiration did this be in the money and expiration did this is< is what you want to keep in mind so this is what you want to keep in mind so this is< is how i would select my uh poor man's is how i would select my uh poor man's covered< covered call strike for both the long covered call strike for both the long call< call and this covered call so if this call and this covered call so if this has< has been helpful for you you're right has been helpful for you you're right you< you feel that this has really helped you you feel that this has really helped you i< i would appreciate it if you would just i would appreciate it if you would just click< click the thumbs up button and also click the thumbs up button and also subscribe< subscribe so you can see more videos subscribe so you can see more videos like< like this in the future like this in the future all< all right so tactic number two is timing all right so tactic number two is timing entries< entries so timing entries basically entries so timing entries basically means< means that you want to time your entries means that you want to time your entries for< for when you enter the permanent cover for when you enter the permanent cover call< call because the permanent cover call call because the permanent cover call after< after all is a bullish strategy right after all is a bullish strategy right it's< it's a bullish option strategy that it's a bullish option strategy that means< means you want the market to go up when means you want the market to go up when you< you enter right so the last thing you you enter right so the last thing you want< want to do is to enter your pullman's want to do is to enter your pullman's cover< cover call down here and then the market cover call down here and then the market didn't< didn't go up instead it subsequently didn't go up instead it subsequently went< went down so in this case you'll went down so in this case you'll probably< probably be cursing yourself you know probably be cursing yourself you know why< why did i why did i buy< buy at this point right i should have buy at this point right i should have chosen< chosen a better entry price to enter so chosen a better entry price to enter so this< this way the market will go in your this way the market will go in your favor< favor so this is what tactic two is favor so this is what tactic two is number< number is all about and i'm going to number is all about and i'm going to share< share with you uh three patterns that share with you uh three patterns that you< you want to take note of you want to take note of you< you want to have it ingrain your mind so you want to have it ingrain your mind so that< that you can use it as a very good that you can use it as a very good potential< potential permanence cover call entry or potential permanence cover call entry or any< any bullish option strategies for that any bullish option strategies for that matter< matter all right so the first is what i matter all right so the first is what i call< call the continuation pattern so call the continuation pattern so continuation< continuation patterns continuation patterns so< so in this case it's an uptrend right an so in this case it's an uptrend right an uptrend< uptrend is when the market is forming uptrend is when the market is forming what< what you call this higher highs what you call this higher highs and< and higher lows all right so you will and higher lows all right so you will only< only normally see this pattern when the only normally see this pattern when the market< market is in a bull market right when market is in a bull market right when it's< it's in an uptrend right right now if it's in an uptrend right right now if the< the market is in a bear market right you the market is in a bear market right you or< or when markets crashing you will seldom or when markets crashing you will seldom see< see this pattern but the market when it see this pattern but the market when it eventually< eventually goes back to a bull market eventually goes back to a bull market again< again then you will see a lot of these again then you will see a lot of these patterns< patterns so as you can see it's forming patterns so as you can see it's forming this< this higher highs higher lows this higher highs higher lows and< and it's going higher high again higher and it's going higher high again higher lows< lows so the point in time where you want lows so the point in time where you want to< to identify this uh entry point is when to identify this uh entry point is when the< the market is making this higher lows the market is making this higher lows right< right you can see this is a higher low right you can see this is a higher low area< area down here and you want to coincide area down here and you want to coincide this< this with the stochastic oscillator you this with the stochastic oscillator you want< want to see that it is oversold right if want to see that it is oversold right if you< you have seen my previous videos you'll you have seen my previous videos you'll see< see that i i kind of like this see that i i kind of like this stochastic< stochastic oscillator because it gives stochastic oscillator because it gives me< me a very good gauge of what the market me a very good gauge of what the market sentiment< sentiment is what it's going to do right sentiment is what it's going to do right now now now of< of course one thing to bear in mind is of course one thing to bear in mind is that< that this is not of course 100 accurate that this is not of course 100 accurate it's< it's not like every time it's oversold it's not like every time it's oversold the< the market is definitely going to go up the market is definitely going to go up right< right no it's not it doesn't do that all right no it's not it doesn't do that all the< the time right but rather this is a the time right but rather this is a gauge< gauge of probability so remember with gauge of probability so remember with options< options with trading everything we're options with trading everything we're going< going to do is all in terms of going to do is all in terms of probability< probability so at this point of time probability so at this point of time when< when the market is oversold there is a when the market is oversold there is a higher< higher probability of it going up than higher probability of it going up than it< it is to go down because would you it is to go down because would you rather< rather enter a permanent cover call rather enter a permanent cover call right< right a bully strategy when the market right a bully strategy when the market is< is overbought right it doesn't make is overbought right it doesn't make sense< sense right you'll rather win until it's sense right you'll rather win until it's oversold< oversold before you enter into a bullish oversold before you enter into a bullish strategy< strategy because this way it has a strategy because this way it has a better< better chance of it going up immediately better chance of it going up immediately after< after you enter into the position so for after you enter into the position so for the< the continuation pattern what you want the continuation pattern what you want to< to look out for is for this higher lows to look out for is for this higher lows and< and when this higher low happens and when this higher low happens you< you want to take a look at the you want to take a look at the stochastic< stochastic oscillator and see that if it stochastic oscillator and see that if it becomes< becomes oversold so as you can see there becomes oversold so as you can see there are< are two instances here where it are two instances here where it coincides< coincides with a higher low pattern and coincides with a higher low pattern and the< the market all right rather the the market all right rather the stochastics< stochastics is showing an oversold so stochastics is showing an oversold so this< this are very good places where you can this are very good places where you can get< get into the poor man's covered call get into the poor man's covered call okay< okay so the second pattern you want to okay so the second pattern you want to look< look out for is to find support areas look out for is to find support areas again again again support< support areas are basically the places support areas are basically the places where< where the market has difficulty going where the market has difficulty going below< below so it's normally uh below the below so it's normally uh below the previous< previous low so you can see this is a previous low so you can see this is a previous< previous low so if i were to just previous low so if i were to just stretch< stretch my line across down here just stretch my line across down here just draw< draw a line across here you'll see that draw a line across here you'll see that there< there are many instances where the there are many instances where the market< market would bounce off this levels market would bounce off this levels right right right and< and the reason why the market and the reason why the market right< right was the bounce of this area is right was the bounce of this area is because< because there's a stronger buying because there's a stronger buying pressure< pressure right there's a stronger buying pressure right there's a stronger buying volume< volume than selling volume so volume than selling volume so there< there are people in the market saying there are people in the market saying right< right why the right why the the< the market moves is because there is the market moves is because there is more< more buyers than sellers all right they more buyers than sellers all right they say< say that the market is moving up because say that the market is moving up because there< there are more buyers than there are there are more buyers than there are more more more sellers< sellers but this is actually not true sellers but this is actually not true right< right the reason is because it is not right the reason is because it is not the< the number of buyers that move the the number of buyers that move the market< market what moves the market is the market what moves the market is the volume< volume the size of your transaction so volume the size of your transaction so for< for example if there are a hundred for example if there are a hundred people< people down here people down here and< and they all want to sell 10 shares each and they all want to sell 10 shares each right< right 10 shares each the total number of right 10 shares each the total number of shares< shares down here would be a thousand shares down here would be a thousand shares< shares right so a thousand shares shares right so a thousand shares they're< they're trying to sell down here now they're trying to sell down here now what< what if you have say just one person what if you. have say just one person down< down here and this is an institution and down here and this is an institution and this< this institution wants to buy 10 000 this institution wants to buy 10 000 shares shares shares so< so do you think the market will go up or so do you think the market will go up or will< will the market go down right there are will the market go down right there are more< more sellers right there are 100 people more sellers right there are 100 people selling< selling but they're only selling 10 selling but they're only selling 10 shares< shares each but there's one buyer down shares each but there's one buyer down here< here and he wants to buy a whopping 10 here and he wants to buy a whopping 10 000< 000 shares so obviously the market will 000 shares so obviously the market will go< go up because market moves because of go up because market moves because of volume< volume there is more volume there is more transactions< transactions here there's more shares transactions here there's more shares wanting< wanting to be bought than there is to be wanting to be bought than there is to be sold< sold so what happens is that this guy sold so what happens is that this guy down< down here one person he will buy up all down here one person he will buy up all this< this thousand shares and then he will this thousand shares and then he will have< have a leftover of 9 000 shares have a leftover of 9 000 shares so< so if people cannot clear this 9000 so if people cannot clear this 9000 shares< shares they cannot sell enough for the shares they cannot sell enough for the nine< nine thousand guess what the market will nine thousand guess what the market will keep< keep going up so that is why the market keep going up so that is why the market moves< moves so if people tell you or you hear moves so if people tell you or you hear this< this they say to you you know that the this they say to you you know that the market< market goes up because there are more market goes up because there are more buyers< buyers and sellers then you know they buyers and sellers then you know they don't< don't really know what they are saying don't really know what they are saying and< and this is something that i do day in and this is something that i do day in day< day out when i was in the proprietary day out when i was in the proprietary trading< trading desk because all we look at is trading desk because all we look at is just< just this order uh this order flow we just this order uh this order flow we call< call it order flow because we see the call it order flow because we see the number< number of orders and transaction going number of orders and transaction going through< through all right so i've gone on on the through all right so i've gone on on the tangent< tangent down here so i apologize for tangent down here so i apologize for that< that but i wanted you to know that so that but i wanted you to know that so you< you have a better understanding of how you have a better understanding of how market< market moves but okay back to this market moves but okay back to this basically< basically what we want to do is we want basically what we want to do is we want to< to look at support areas right support to look at support areas right support areas< areas basically you want to find a areas basically you want to find a previous< previous low and then you draw a line a previous low and then you draw a line a box< box an area where there is you know uh box an area where there is you know uh so< so for this you would draw an area so for this you would draw an area something< something like this so you can see that something like this so you can see that this< this is the area where the market tends this is the area where the market tends to< to bounce off right so you want to to bounce off right so you want to coincide< coincide this again with the stochastics coincide this again with the stochastics right< right so you can see each time right so you can see each time whenever< whenever the market is trying to test whenever the market is trying to test the< the previous low this support area and the previous low this support area and when< when it coincides with a stochastic when it coincides with a stochastic reading< reading of oversold the market went up reading of oversold the market went up right< right each time it went up right each time it went up so< so again this is all about probability so again this is all about probability you< you can see that it tends to work pretty you can see that it tends to work pretty well< well when the market is going sideways well when the market is going sideways so< so this is areas where you want to get so this is areas where you want to get into< into the poor man's covered call so it's into the poor man's covered call so it's definitely< definitely much better than if you were definitely much better than if you were to< to get in this area here then you have to get in this area here then you have experienced< experienced this drop before it comes experienced this drop before it comes back< back up and you still haven't made money back up and you still haven't made money on< on your permits cover call on your permits cover call and< and at the same time your your long call and at the same time your your long call is< is deteriorating in value right so you is deteriorating in value right so you want< want to be smart about this find support want to be smart about this find support areas< areas to enter alright so this is the areas to enter alright so this is the second second second pattern< pattern that you want to look out for pattern that you want to look out for now< now the third and last pattern would be now the third and last pattern would be the< the reversal pattern so this reversal the reversal pattern so this reversal pattern< pattern basically what we are looking pattern basically what we are looking for< for is a bullish reversal pattern so for is a bullish reversal pattern so this< this happens when the market is in a this happens when the market is in a downtrend< downtrend so remember previously we downtrend so remember previously we talked< talked about up trends when the market talked about up trends when the market makes< makes higher highs higher lows for a makes higher highs higher lows for a downtrend< downtrend it is an opposite all right downtrend it is an opposite all right it's< it's the opposite it will be making it's the opposite it will be making lower< lower lows lower lows and< and lower highs right so we know this is and lower highs right so we know this is in< in a downtrend so you can see this is in a downtrend so you can see this is what< what it's doing right it's making lower what it's doing right it's making lower lows lows lows lower< lower highs right lower highs right so< so this is what we want to look out for so this is what we want to look out for when< when it makes a lower low all right we when it makes a lower low all right we want< want to see try and break below a want to see try and break below a previous< previous low so you can see down here it previous low so you can see down here it tries< tries to break below this previous low tries to break below this previous low but< but it couldn't instead it closed above but it couldn't instead it closed above and< and it closed with a bullish candlestick and it closed with a bullish candlestick pattern< pattern all right this is a bullish pattern all right this is a bullish candlestick< candlestick bar and then as you can see candlestick bar and then as you can see it< it formed this lower low but then you it formed this lower low but then you want< want to take a look at the stochastics want to take a look at the stochastics so< so now the stochastics not only does it so now the stochastics not only does it is< is it used to see oversold or overbought is it used to see oversold or overbought readings< readings we also can use to see readings we also can use to see divergence< divergence so divergence is when you see divergence so divergence is when you see there< there is a there is a difference< difference in terms of the wave pattern difference in terms of the wave pattern all< all right between the stock price and all right between the stock price and the< the oscillator this stochastic so you the oscillator this stochastic so you can< can see the price is making a lower low can see the price is making a lower low but< but then the stochastic is making a but then the stochastic is making a higher< higher low so this is what i call you higher low so this is what i call you know< know divergence there's a divergence know divergence there's a divergence that< that means it indicates that the price that means it indicates that the price has< has a higher chance of it going up has a higher chance of it going up than< than it is to go down so this is a good than it is to go down so this is a good time< time for us to enter into the poor man's time for us to enter into the poor man's covered< covered call so again covered call so again let< let me just remove all these drawings let me just remove all these drawings for< for you so you can uh for you so you can uh see< see it better so again what we're going see it better so again what we're going to< to look out for is a lower low pattern to look out for is a lower low pattern this< this downtrend pattern where it's trying this downtrend pattern where it's trying to< to make to make this< this lower high lower lows this lower high lower lows and< and then we want to try and see it break and then we want to try and see it break a< a previous low right a previous low a previous low right a previous low and< and then we want to see it close above and then we want to see it close above this< this previous low so once we see that this previous low so once we see that it's< it's closed this previous low we know it's closed this previous low we know that< that this is a support area remember that this is a support area remember from from from the< the previous pattern so there's a the previous pattern so there's a support< support area here support area here and< and then now let's take a look at and then now let's take a look at whether< whether there is any divergence so this whether there is any divergence so this is< is forming a lower low whereas our is forming a lower low whereas our stochastics< stochastics right this stochastics you stochastics right this stochastics you can< can see is forming a higher low so here can see is forming a higher low so here we< we know there is a bullish divergence we know there is a bullish divergence which< which means does it mean it will 100 go which means does it mean it will 100 go up< up no it doesn't mean that it just means up no it doesn't mean that it just means there< there is a higher probability of it there is a higher probability of it going< going up than it is to go down all right going up than it is to go down all right so< so this is the three patterns now the so this is the three patterns now the third< third tactic is what i call a legging in third tactic is what i call a legging in and< and this is the most advanced tactic of and this is the most advanced tactic of all< all and if you use this right it can all and if you use this right it can really< really give you an edge in terms of the really give you an edge in terms of the profits< profits that you make right profits that you make right and< and this is something that i learned and this is something that i learned when< when i was at the proprietary trading when i was at the proprietary trading desk< desk when i was uh with the proprietary desk when i was uh with the proprietary trading< trading firm so the propriety trading trading firm so the propriety trading from< from if you're not familiar is basically from if you're not familiar is basically a< a place where they hire traders like a place where they hire traders like myself< myself and then they will just give you myself and then they will just give you funds< funds they will fund your account and funds they will fund your account and then< then you will if you make money on the then you will if you make money on the funds< funds that they give you through trading funds that they give you through trading the< the market they will give you a profit the market they will give you a profit share< share right if you don't make money then share right if you don't make money then you< you go home empty-handed so you go home empty-handed so back< back then when we were doing this back then when we were doing this legging< legging right i was at the futures desk legging right i was at the futures desk right< right so at the proprietary training right so at the proprietary training firm< firm i had firm i had been< been at the equities desk and i've been been at the equities desk and i've been at< at the futures test so at the futures at the futures test so at the futures test< test what we did is what we call test what we did is what we call spreading< spreading so spreading basically is just spreading so spreading basically is just finding< finding two very uh correlated highly finding two very uh correlated highly correlated< correlated uh correlated uh instruments< instruments basically instruments basically uh< uh financial products for example uh uh financial products for example uh like< like the qqq's and the spiders they are like the qqq's and the spiders they are very< very highly correlated so what we would very highly correlated so what we would do< do is we would buy one and we would sell do is we would buy one and we would sell one< one so back then at the proprietary one so back then at the proprietary trading< trading firm i was doing the treasury trading firm i was doing the treasury notes< notes right i was doing the 10-year notes right i was doing the 10-year treasury< treasury notes as well treasury notes as well spread< spread it against the australian 10-year spread it against the australian 10-year t-bond< t-bond because they move very similar to t-bond because they move very similar to each< each other so as an example let's just each other so as an example let's just use< use this broad-based index so basically use this broad-based index so basically what< what it means is that let's say for what it means is that let's say for example< example we want to get into this spread example we want to get into this spread what< what we will do is when the market is what we will do is when the market is going< going up going up remember< remember they will move in tandem if qqq remember they will move in tandem if qqq goes< goes up spiders goes up spiders goes goes up spiders goes up spiders goes down< down qq generally go down so what we do down qq generally go down so what we do is< is that when it goes up i would is that when it goes up i would basically< basically just enter a buy order down basically just enter a buy order down here< here and then once it goes up a little here and then once it goes up a little bit< bit i'll enter a sell order on the bit i'll enter a sell order on the spider< spider so this is what you call the the spider so this is what you call the the spread< spread so you're spraying this between spread so you're spraying this between these< these two products right anyway the these two products right anyway the point< point on the back here is that with point on the back here is that with options< options you can do spreading as well options you can do spreading as well right< right so remember when you enter the right so remember when you enter the permanent< permanent cover call usually we enter it permanent cover call usually we enter it as< as one order ticket right we do the long as one order ticket right we do the long call< call and the short call call and the short call together< together in one order ticket so this together in one order ticket so this gives< gives us the gives us the net< net price right because you already take net price right because you already take the< the cost into consideration and then the cost into consideration and then this< this is the net so maybe this probably this is the net so maybe this probably as< as an example maybe this long call will as an example maybe this long call will cost< cost 38 dollars and the short call will cost 38 dollars and the short call will probably< probably cost um probably cost um 64< 64 cents right 64 cents plus 36 yeah 64 cents right 64 cents plus 36 yeah that's< that's 38 so this gives you uh the net that's 38 so this gives you uh the net price< price down here right price down here right so< so when you're doing legging in you do so when you're doing legging in you do not< not enter this as one order ticket not enter this as one order ticket instead< instead you split them up so leaking in instead you split them up so leaking in basically< basically basically is the process of basically basically is the process of entering< entering into the licks of a spread entering into the licks of a spread separately< separately so first you will buy the separately so first you will buy the long< long call option first we will buy this long call option first we will buy this first< first and then we wait for the price to first and then we wait for the price to go< go up then we sell this covered call so go up then we sell this covered call so you< you might be wondering why do we want to you might be wondering why do we want to do< do that right do that right and< and the reason we want to link in is and the reason we want to link in is because< because it can improve your entry price because it can improve your entry price and< and then it can increase your profits as and then it can increase your profits as well< well so let me give you an example down well so let me give you an example down here< here so let's say for example here so let's say for example uh< uh as if we have identified let's say we uh as if we have identified let's say we have< have decided to enter the poor man's have decided to enter the poor man's cover< cover call when the price is somewhere cover call when the price is somewhere around< around here okay so let's say we enter around here okay so let's say we enter the the the long< long call first long call first and< and let's say we get a long call for 10 and let's say we get a long call for 10 and< and let's say at this point of time and let's say at this point of time let's< let's say we are looking to enter the let's say we are looking to enter the 136< 136 a covered call so let's say it's the 136 a covered call so let's say it's the premium< premium at this point of time is one premium at this point of time is one dollar< dollar all right so normally if we want dollar all right so normally if we want to< to enter the appointments cover call we to enter the appointments cover call we enter< enter as a single order ticket so when enter as a single order ticket so when the< the price is here we enter this both the price is here we enter this both simultaneously< simultaneously so this gives us a net simultaneously so this gives us a net price< price of nine dollars now with leaking price of nine dollars now with leaking in< in what we want to do instead first is in what we want to do instead first is we< we want to enter this first and wait for we want to enter this first and wait for the< the market to go up so once the market the market to go up so once the market go< go up then we sell the cover call at the go up then we sell the cover call at the strike< strike price right so we have determined strike price right so we have determined previously< previously was 136 so at this point of previously was 136 so at this point of time time time this< this strike price this cover call no this strike price this cover call no longer< longer goes for a dollar how much does longer goes for a dollar how much does it< it go for right it increases in price it go for right it increases in price because< because as the market goes up because as the market goes up you< you know this out of the money call you know this out of the money call becomes< becomes closer towards the current becomes closer towards the current strike< strike price or rather the current stock strike price or rather the current stock market< market price right now so this no longer market price right now so this no longer because< because one dollar maybe this now because one dollar maybe this now increases< increases to three dollars so instead increases to three dollars so instead right< right now your net price would become right now your net price would become seven< seven dollars so you made a price seven dollars so you made a price improvement< improvement of two dollars and you still improvement of two dollars and you still had< had the same strike price as previously had the same strike price as previously right< right previously you got the same strike right previously you got the same strike price< price you only could sell it for a price you only could sell it for a dollar< dollar right now you could sell it for dollar right now you could sell it for three< three dollars so you still keep the same three dollars so you still keep the same intrinsic< intrinsic value a profit if the price intrinsic value a profit if the price were< were to go up so this is uh all about were to go up so this is uh all about lagging< lagging in lagging in now< now the other way of looking in or now the other way of looking in or rather< rather the other thing you would do of rather the other thing you would do of lagging< lagging so let's say for example instead lagging so let's say for example instead let< let me just clear this drawing here so let me just clear this drawing here so again< again let's say we buy this at ten again let's say we buy this at ten dollars dollars dollars all< all right so let's say uh you want to all right so let's say uh you want to sell< sell the premium of your covered call sell the premium of your covered call for< for one dollar and at this point of time for one dollar and at this point of time when< when you first entered the long call the when you first entered the long call the 136< 136 strike price is giving you one 136 strike price is giving you one dollar< dollar right so you tell yourself i want dollar right so you tell yourself i want to< to pay a maximum of nine dollars for to pay a maximum of nine dollars for this< this a spread this a spread but< but instead of going in at this price but instead of going in at this price you< you wait for the market to go up first you wait for the market to go up first so< so that means you enter the long call so that means you enter the long call you< you wait for the market to go up first you wait for the market to go up first and< and then suddenly you'll see that and then suddenly you'll see that previously< previously this 140 strike price previously this 140 strike price previously< previously it was probably only going previously it was probably only going for< for let's say 25 cents right but because for let's say 25 cents right but because the< the market has gone up right now this the market has gone up right now this uh< uh covered call is now going for one uh covered call is now going for one dollar dollar dollar right< right so instead of selling this one you right so instead of selling this one you say< say that you know you wanted to lock in say that you know you wanted to lock in the< the the premium you want to ideally sell the the premium you want to ideally sell for< for one dollar for one dollar so< so now you have a net price of still so now you have a net price of still nine< nine dollars so you sell the highest nine dollars so you sell the highest strike< strike price strike price and< and then now not only do you get the uh and then now not only do you get the uh same< same net price as you would if you sold same net price as you would if you sold this< this year but right now you have an this year but right now you have an increase< increase uh potential profit in terms of increase uh potential profit in terms of the< the intrinsic value because now your the intrinsic value because now your your< your profits are no longer kept to 136 your profits are no longer kept to 136 because< because right now your cover cost is at because right now your cover cost is at one< one four zero so you can see here not one four zero so you can see here not only< only do you get uh only do you get uh this< this is a a better price because you're this is a a better price because you're getting< getting at a further strike price you getting at a further strike price you increase< increase as well your intrinsic value increase as well your intrinsic value gains< gains so right now you could get a four gains so right now you could get a four dollars dollars dollars intrinsic< intrinsic value gain down here from 136 intrinsic value gain down here from 136 to< to 140.

so that is why you might want to to 140. so that is why you might want to lake< lake in now you might be thinking you lake in now you might be thinking you know< know leggings so good are there any risk know leggings so good are there any risk yes< yes there are risks so this is what we yes there are risks so this is what we would< would call at the proprietary trading would call at the proprietary trading firm< firm we call this lagging risk so firm we call this lagging risk so licking< licking rings is basically uh where you licking rings is basically uh where you you< you know had a mistake in leaguing you know had a mistake in leaguing or< or rather where the price starts to drop or rather where the price starts to drop down< down so this is where you get a worse down so this is where you get a worse entry< entry price and instead of getting uh entry price and instead of getting uh increasing< increasing your profits you actually increasing your profits you actually lower< lower your profits so lower your profits so what< what happens so let me just show you what happens so let me just show you what< what happens so let's say for example what happens so let's say for example you< you want to lag in and again we enter you want to lag in and again we enter the< the long call first and this time it's the long call first and this time it's for< for ten dollars all right same ten for ten dollars all right same ten dollars< dollars but instead of the price going dollars but instead of the price going up< up the price actually went down right up the price actually went down right you< you entered here and the price went down you entered here and the price went down and< and previously you wanted to sell let's and previously you wanted to sell let's say< say you wanted to sell say you wanted to sell okay< okay let me just remove this let's say okay let me just remove this let's say previously< previously that you wanted to sell at previously that you wanted to sell at the< the 136 strike price all right from the the 136 strike price all right from the previous< previous example remember one dollar is previous example remember one dollar is the< the strike price which we want to sell the strike price which we want to sell it< it but then because the market went down it but then because the market went down this< this no longer becomes one dollar this this no longer becomes one dollar this suddenly< suddenly becomes only maybe 25 cents suddenly becomes only maybe 25 cents so< so now if you want to sell this cover so now if you want to sell this cover call< call you'll be getting lesser than if call you'll be getting lesser than if you< you would have if you just sold it you would have if you just sold it previously< previously when you entered this long previously when you entered this long call< call so now you get a worse entry price call so now you get a worse entry price because< because now you have to buy it for because now you have to buy it for much< much more than you would previously and much more than you would previously and let's< let's say if you say that you want to let's say if you say that you want to still< still keep that one dollar premium that still keep that one dollar premium that means< means you still want to receive a dollar means you still want to receive a dollar for< for this covered call premium so what do for this covered call premium so what do you< you do you have to compensate it right you do you have to compensate it right so< so you have to instead of selling at 136 so you have to instead of selling at 136 strike< strike price maybe now you have to lower strike price maybe now you have to lower your< your strike price right maybe you have your strike price right maybe you have to< to lower the 130 then you can get the to lower the 130 then you can get the one< one dollar so what happened here one dollar so what happened here although< although you kept the net price the same although you kept the net price the same as< as though as if you would if you had as though as if you would if you had sold< sold it when you first initiated the sold it when you first initiated the promise< promise cover call but right now promise cover call but right now you< you have the same night price but your you have the same night price but your intrinsic< intrinsic value has decreased because intrinsic value has decreased because previously< previously you could have a potential previously you could have a potential gain< gain on the intrinsic value portion gain on the intrinsic value portion of< of all the way up to 136 but right now of all the way up to 136 but right now you< you only can gain about one three zero you only can gain about one three zero so< so right now suddenly this per permanent so right now suddenly this per permanent cover< cover call is really looking like it's cover call is really looking like it's gonna< gonna really make you a poor man right gonna really make you a poor man right so< so it's not gonna be as good as if you so it's not gonna be as good as if you had< had entered originally one uh order had entered originally one uh order together< together or together one at one time together or together one at one time right< right so right so that< that is the risk of leaking in but that that is the risk of leaking in but that is< is why when you are using this tactic is why when you are using this tactic you< you want to combine it together with you want to combine it together with tactic< tactic number two right the second tactic number two right the second tactic< tactic which i shared with you was the tactic which i shared with you was the entries< entries right you want to time it. with entries right you want to time it with entries< entries so let's give a quick recap of entries so let's give a quick recap of what< what are the three patterns you want to what are the three patterns you want to look< look out for so the first pattern you look out for so the first pattern you want< want to look up for remember is the want to look up for remember is the continuation< continuation pattern is when the market continuation pattern is when the market is< is in an uptrend where it's forming all is in an uptrend where it's forming all these< these higher highs and higher lows right these higher highs and higher lows right so< so what you want to look out for is when so what you want to look out for is when the< the market is forming this uh lower the market is forming this uh lower uh< uh higher low sorry this higher lows and uh higher low sorry this higher lows and then< then you want to see the stochastics then you want to see the stochastics right< right and if the stochastics is at the right and if the stochastics is at the oversold< oversold region oversold region then< then this is a good time for us to enter then this is a good time for us to enter the< the poor man's cover call so this is the the poor man's cover call so this is the continuation< continuation pattern now the second one continuation pattern now the second one is is is the< the support area right so we know that the support area right so we know that the< the stock all right we'll be moving in the stock all right we'll be moving in like< like consolidation this this this uh like consolidation this this this uh horizontal< horizontal lines all right so we want to horizontal lines all right so we want to identify< identify these support areas and then we identify these support areas and then we want< want to look at the stochastics as well want to look at the stochastics as well to< to see whether is it oversold right and to see whether is it oversold right and if< if it's over so if it's over so and< and it coincides if it's over so and it and it coincides if it's over so and it coincides< coincides with uh break of the previous coincides with uh break of the previous support< support area or it tries to break the support area or it tries to break the support< support area it cannot right then this support area it cannot right then this is< is a good time again to enter into the is a good time again to enter into the poor< poor man's cover call right so there's poor man's cover call right so there's the< the second pattern now the final pattern the second pattern now the final pattern is< is the reversal pattern so the reversal is the reversal pattern so the reversal pattern< pattern specifically we're looking at pattern specifically we're looking at the< the bullish reversal pattern that means the bullish reversal pattern that means we're< we're looking for a downtrend right so we're looking for a downtrend right so this< this is opposite to the uptrend we are this is opposite to the uptrend we are looking< looking for a looking for a lower< lower low and then the lower high so lower low and then the lower high so what< what we're looking for is for a break of what we're looking for is for a break of the< the previous low the previous low and< and then we want to see that right he and then we want to see that right he has< has trouble breaking below and it closes has trouble breaking below and it closes above< above and once it closes above we want above and once it closes above we want to< to take a look at the stochastics to see to take a look at the stochastics to see whether< whether there is a divergence right whether there is a divergence right so< so this is making a lower low as you can so this is making a lower low as you can see< see so we want to see that our see so we want to see that our stochastics< stochastics right is making a higher low stochastics right is making a higher low so< so this way there is a divergence so so this way there is a divergence so this< this is when we would enter into the this is when we would enter into the poor< poor man's covered call all right so by poor man's covered call all right so by the< the way please ignore all these messy the way please ignore all these messy drawings< drawings kind of look like the madden drawings kind of look like the madden nfl nfl nfl playbook< playbook all right

==============================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about how you we're going to be talking about how you can< can make a living trading just one can make a living trading just one option< option strategy and this is suitable for option strategy and this is suitable for you< you as well if you're a beginner if you as well if you're a beginner if you're< you're just starting out trading options you're just starting out trading options not< not too long then the reason is because not too long then the reason is because this< this is a pretty simple strategy to this is a pretty simple strategy to execute< execute right it's a very simple execute right it's a very simple strategy< strategy to construct as well so what is strategy to construct as well so what is this< this strategy that you can actually use this strategy that you can actually use to< to make a living well it is the put to make a living well it is the put credit< credit spread right also known as The credit spread right also known as The Bull< Bull put spread so you might be Bull put spread so you might be wondering< wondering you know why use the put wondering you know why use the put credit< credit spread especially you know if you credit spread especially you know if you were< were to rely on just one strategy to were to rely on just one strategy to earn< earn a living right just through trading earn a living right just through trading this< this strategy well there are a few this strategy well there are a few reasons< reasons well these few reasons pretty reasons well these few reasons pretty important< important so the very first reason is important so the very first reason is that< that your max loss is limited so this is that your max loss is limited so this is a< a defined R strategy which means to say a defined R strategy which means to say that< that you know the market can go all the that you know the market can go all the way< way down all the way to zero you don't way down all the way to zero you don't have< have to be afraid right because your Max have to be afraid right because your Max loss< loss has already been kept to where you loss has already been kept to where you bought< bought this long put so it's a very bought this long put so it's a very relatively< relatively safe strategy in a sense relatively safe strategy in a sense whereby< whereby you don't have to worry if the whereby you don't have to worry if the market< market kind of crashes because if you do market kind of crashes because if you do not< not have this long put down here then if not have this long put down here then if the< the market keeps going down then you can the market keeps going down then you can keep< keep losing money indefinitely so since keep losing money indefinitely so since you're< you're starting out right trading you're starting out right trading options< options or you haven't been trading for options or you haven't been trading for that< that long you want to put on a strategy that long you want to put on a strategy that< that has defined risk that means your that has defined risk that means your max< max loss has already been limited so you max loss has already been limited so you don't< don't have to worry about the stock you don't have to worry about the stock you know< know going all the way to zero right so know going all the way to zero right so that's< that's the very first important reason that's the very first important reason now< now the second reason is that the p now the second reason is that the p credit< credit spread has a very high win rate credit spread has a very high win rate right< right you can see down here the win rate right you can see down here the win rate is< is about 80 to 90% depending on how you is about 80 to 90% depending on how you manage< manage it right so basically it has a manage it right so basically it has a pretty< pretty pretty high win rate but this pretty pretty high win rate but this also< also depends on two things right you also depends on two things right you number< number one you need to put on the right number one you need to put on the right underline< underline which I'm going to touch on underline which I'm going to touch on later< later on and number two you need to later on and number two you need to choose< choose the right Delta so I'm going to choose the right Delta so I'm going to show< show you both of them for this strategy show you both of them for this strategy how< how you're going to actually execute it how you're going to actually execute it so< so you can get you know pretty high win so you can get you know pretty high win rate< rate so if you have a very high win rate rate so if you have a very high win rate this< this leads us to our next reason you this leads us to our next reason you know< know why you want to put on a correct know why you want to put on a correct spread< spread and it's a very important one and spread and it's a very important one and that< that is that it actually has very short that is that it actually has very short losing< losing streaks now this is something losing streaks now this is something that< that I don't see many people talk about that I don't see many people talk about right< right because losing streaks is actually right because losing streaks is actually a< a very important topic to understand a very important topic to understand because< because when you're putting on any because when you're putting on any strategy< strategy you need to know roughly you strategy you need to know roughly you know< know what are the number of consecutive know what are the number of consecutive losers< losers that you probably can have in a losers that you probably can have in a row< row right so many people will put on a row right so many people will put on a strategy< strategy and if they lose maybe about a strategy and if they lose maybe about a few< few times in a row they may just stop few times in a row they may just stop putting< putting on the strategy thinking that it putting on the strategy thinking that it doesn't< doesn't work right but when it comes to doesn't work right but when it comes to trading< trading options probability is always trading options probability is always what< what you want to look at right because what you want to look at right because everything< everything involves probability so just everything involves probability so just by< by knowing the win rate of the strategy by knowing the win rate of the strategy you< you can roughly know what is the losing you can roughly know what is the losing staks< staks that you can have right how many staks that you can have right how many consecutive< consecutive losing traits you can have consecutive losing traits you can have so< so down here is a table that shows the so down here is a table that shows the probability< probability of X consecutive losing probability of X consecutive losing trades< trades within a 100 Trade sequence so trades within a 100 Trade sequence so what< what that basically just means is that what that basically just means is that how< how many losers do you have in a row if how many losers do you have in a row if you< you have a total of 100 trades right you you have a total of 100 trades right you put< put on 100 put credit spread trads so put on 100 put credit spread trads so this< this is very important to understand this is very important to understand because< because it affects your psychology right because it affects your psychology right you< you need to be able to know roughly when you need to be able to know roughly when the< the strategy is going to be working or the strategy is going to be working or when< when the strategy is starting to not when the strategy is starting to not work< work out right so this actually gives work out right so this actually gives you< you an indication of what to expect as you an indication of what to expect as you< you trade the strategy so as you already you trade the strategy so as you already seen< seen in the last table this put credit seen in the last table this put credit spread< spread can actually give you roughly 80 spread can actually give you roughly 80 to< to 90% win rate so that is why you can to 90% win rate so that is why you can see< see down here I've already highlighted see down here I've already highlighted the< the box below in blue you can see that the box below in blue you can see that the< the win rate down here anywhere from 80 the win rate down here anywhere from 80 to< to 90% so let's just focus on the 80% so to 90% so let's just focus on the 80% so let's< let's say for example you put on a put let's say for example you put on a put credit< credit spread and you know that it has credit spread and you know that it has roughly< roughly about an 80% win rate then guess roughly about an 80% win rate then guess what< what you really roughly know that first what you really roughly know that first first< first of all it's pretty much very first of all it's pretty much very impossible< impossible for you to reach seven losses impossible for you to reach seven losses in< in a row right that means you trade in a row right that means you trade seven< seven times and all sevens are losses seven times and all sevens are losses why< why because it shows that it's 0% so you why because it shows that it's 0% so you know< know that if the strategy that you trade know that if the strategy that you trade supposed< supposed to have an 80% win rate but supposed to have an 80% win rate but then< then you have seven losses in a row then you have seven losses in a row eight< eight losses in a row or more then you eight losses in a row or more then you know< know there's something wrong with the know there's something wrong with the strategy< strategy right but most of the time it strategy right but most of the time it should< should stay within this range down here should stay within this range down here of< of one to six losses so you do not of one to six losses so you do not expect< expect more than six right now the next expect more than six right now the next thing< thing you want to see is the percentage thing you want to see is the percentage right< right so as you can see down here six right so as you can see down here six losses< losses in a row is pretty improbable losses in a row is pretty improbable right< right it's about 1% so not to say that right it's about 1% so not to say that it< it won't happen it's just that it's very it won't happen it's just that it's very rare< rare right that means to say you rare right that means to say you probably< probably want to have 100 times 100 probably want to have 100 times 100 Trade< Trade sequence before you have one time Trade sequence before you have one time roughly< roughly you have about six losses in a roughly you have about six losses in a row< row so this is pretty improbable so we row so this is pretty improbable so we will< will be roughly like striking this out will be roughly like striking this out 3%< 3% also pretty improbable so the one 3% also pretty improbable so the one we're< we're really looking. at is somewhere we're really looking at is somewhere from< from one to four losses in a row right from one to four losses in a row right so< so this is what you really want to so this is what you really want to Expect< Expect When You're trading this kind of Expect When You're trading this kind of strategy< strategy so let's say for example you strategy so let's say for example you put< put on the put credit spread and then put on the put credit spread and then you< you have three losses in a row at the you have three losses in a row at the point< point of time you should not give up point of time you should not give up right< right you should not stop trading the right you should not stop trading the strategy< strategy thinking that hey this strategy strategy thinking that hey this strategy doesn't< doesn't work because you already know doesn't work because you already know based< based on this probability table that it based on this probability table that it is< is possible that you can lose up to is possible that you can lose up to three< three or even four losses in a row so three or even four losses in a row so with< with this you are able to really with this you are able to really understand< understand the strategy and continue to understand the strategy and continue to put< put it on now on the other hand if you put it on now on the other hand if you have< have a 90% win rate then you can see have a 90% win rate then you can see right< right the chances of you losing five right the chances of you losing five losses< losses in a row if you go all the way losses in a row if you go all the way down< down here you can see is 0% right so down here you can see is 0% right so that< that means if you're trading a strategy that means if you're trading a strategy that< that has 90% or you construct it so that that has 90% or you construct it so that it< it has a 90% win rate then you shouldn't it has a 90% win rate then you shouldn't be< be seeing five losses in a row right the be seeing five losses in a row right the probability< probability of getting four losses in a probability of getting four losses in a row< row is 1% so this is not that high and row is 1% so this is not that high and the< the next one 9% is pretty probable right the next one 9% is pretty probable right roughly< roughly about one in 10 times around roughly about one in 10 times around there< there around 10% so if you have a 90% there around 10% so if you have a 90% win< win rate strategy you know that you know win rate strategy you know that you know the< the the most likely that you're going to the the most likely that you're going to lose< lose in a row is up to three times in a lose in a row is up to three times in a row< row but other than that it's most likely row but other than that it's most likely going< going to be a profit so when you're going to be a profit so when you're putting< putting on strategies like this putting on strategies like this especially< especially if you're using this to make especially if you're using this to make a< a living right in a sense where you're a living right in a sense where you're relying< relying on the income that you make from relying on the income that you make from Trading< Trading options you want a strategy that Trading options you want a strategy that gives< gives you this wins most of the time it gives you this wins most of the time it doesn't< doesn't feel good when you have a lot of doesn't feel good when you have a lot of losers< losers in a row so that is why this put losers in a row so that is why this put credit< credit spread is a very suitable credit spread is a very suitable strategy< strategy for you especially if you're strategy for you especially if you're starting< starting out because psychology is one starting out because psychology is one of< of the weakest point of many Traders of the weakest point of many Traders right< right just put it that way right I've right just put it that way right I've seen< seen many Traders because of psychology seen many Traders because of psychology they're< they're not able to withand you know they're not able to withand you know this< this kind of losing streak they're not this kind of losing streak they're not sure< sure what their strategy uh to expect sure what their strategy uh to expect for< for their strategy so that's why having for their strategy so that's why having a< a short losing streak for your strategy a short losing streak for your strategy is< is very important now the last and most is very important now the last and most important< important reason why you want to trade important reason why you want to trade the< the put credit spread is because the put credit spread is because extensive< extensive Studies have already shown extensive Studies have already shown that< that the put credit spread right on spy that the put credit spread right on spy this< this is very important is profitable this is very important is profitable over< over the longterm right generally the over the longterm right generally the index< index ETF like spy it has a positive index ETF like spy it has a positive drift< drift right that means to say the market drift right that means to say the market wants< wants to go up over the long term so if wants to go up over the long term so if you're< you're putting on the put credit spread you're putting on the put credit spread which< which is a bullish strategy if the which is a bullish strategy if the market< market keeps going up then you're always market keeps going up then you're always going< going to be profitable in the long term going to be profitable in the long term so< so that is why it's very important to so that is why it's very important to also< also choose the right underlying when also choose the right underlying when you're< you're trading the put credit spread and you're trading the put credit spread and by< by default if you were to choose spy by default if you were to choose spy this< this index ETF then you know that you're this index ETF then you know that you're going< going to do pretty well right because as going to do pretty well right because as you< you can see down here this study down you can see down here this study down here< here is pretty extensive and as you can here is pretty extensive and as you can see< see this study is over a decade or so see this study is over a decade or so right< right you can see since 2006 even went right you can see since 2006 even went to< to the time where there's a subprime to the time where there's a subprime crisis< crisis in 2008 right it went through crisis in 2008 right it went through that< that and the market just kept going up that and the market just kept going up right< right so this is very important to right so this is very important to understand< understand because if you really know understand because if you really know that< that tests have really shown that you that tests have really shown that you can< can be profitable over the longterm can be profitable over the longterm again< again this is another keyword longterm again this is another keyword longterm then< then you're going to have confidence to then you're going to have confidence to put< put your money into the market you're put your money into the market you're going< going to have confidence to trade the going to have confidence to trade the strategy< strategy and you're not going to be you strategy and you're not going to be you know< know worried whether this strategy is know worried whether this strategy is going< going to work out in the long term going to work out in the long term because< because if you think about it it all because if you think about it it all makes< makes sense number one the index ETF makes sense number one the index ETF right< right spy all this are positive drift right spy all this are positive drift right< right if you look back over the past 10 right if you look back over the past 10 20< 20 years the price of this underlying 20 years the price of this underlying the< the index ETF is so much lower than the index ETF is so much lower than where< where it is now right so the market has where it is now right so the market has gone< gone up secondly you're using a bullish gone up secondly you're using a bullish strategy< strategy like the put credit spread the strategy like the put credit spread the put< put credit spread is a bullish strategy put credit spread is a bullish strategy where< where you make money as the market goes where you make money as the market goes up< up and the market has been going up up and the market has been going up right< right so with this two combined you right so with this two combined you already< already know that this is a strategy already know that this is a strategy that< that has a an edge right over the long that has a an edge right over the long term< term so you must understand it's over term so you must understand it's over the< the long term that means it is possible the long term that means it is possible that< that maybe there is a year that you that maybe there is a year that you could< could lose money right for example 2008 could lose money right for example 2008 it's< it's possible that you lose money right it's possible that you lose money right even< even during the pandemic crash it's even during the pandemic crash it's possible< possible that you lose money but it's possible that you lose money but it's important< important to see it for the long term so important to see it for the long term so keep< keep on putting it because the next year keep on putting it because the next year the< the market goes up if you do not put it the market goes up if you do not put it on< on then you will miss out on all the on then you will miss out on all the profits< profits that you could have gained by profits that you could have gained by just< just consistently trading the put credit just consistently trading the put credit spread< spread so the question is how do you spread so the question is how do you trade< trade the put credit spread so there are trade the put credit spread so there are two< two methods to trade the put credit two methods to trade the put credit spread< spread the first method is the Perpetual spread the first method is the Perpetual method< method and the second one is the method and the second one is the selective< selective one by the way if you like selective one by the way if you like this< this video so far Please

com blueprint all right back to< to the video so let's get into the to the video so let's get into the Perpetual< Perpetual one first so the first method Perpetual one first so the first method is< is what I call the Perpetual method and is what I call the Perpetual method and it's< it's used on index ETFs right index ETFs it's used on index ETFs right index ETFs the< the broad-based one like spy QQQ so on the broad-based one like spy QQQ so on and< and so forth and it's very important and so forth and it's very important that< that we select the index ETFs for this that we select the index ETFs for this Perpetual< Perpetual method because we are always Perpetual method because we are always always< always going to have you know a position always going to have you know a position in< in the market right we're always going in the market right we're always going to< to have this uh put spread inside the to have this uh put spread inside the market< market so with the index ETFs there are market so with the index ETFs there are no< no earnings right so no earnings is not no earnings right so no earnings is not going< going to affect our trade whatsoever and going to affect our trade whatsoever and on< on top of that we already know that the on top of that we already know that the index< index ETFs have a positive drift right index ETFs have a positive drift right so< so that is The Edge that we already have so that is The Edge that we already have when< when we're choosing this underlying so when we're choosing this underlying so how< how do you trade this method well there how do you trade this method well there are< are a few steps so step number one is to are a few steps so step number one is to choose< choose the nearest 45 DTE expiration choose the nearest 45 DTE expiration date< date right so as you can see down here date right so as you can see down here the< the one that is nearest to 45 will be the one that is nearest to 45 will be the< the one at 51 days to expiration and why the one at 51 days to expiration and why I< I like to choose around 45 DTE I've I like to choose around 45 DTE I've actually< actually explained this in quite a actually explained this in quite a number< number of my other videos so you can number of my other videos so you can just< just go ahead to watch them but in short just go ahead to watch them but in short basically< basically around the 45 DTE is where we basically around the 45 DTE is where we actually< actually have an edge right the edge actually have an edge right the edge whereby< whereby the Riz move is most often time whereby the Riz move is most often time going< going to be lesser or smaller than the going to be lesser or smaller than the expected< expected move now step number two is expected move now step number two is this< this is where you want to sell the 25 5 this is where you want to sell the 25 5 to< to 35 Delta put spread and when I talk to 35 Delta put spread and when I talk about< about 25 to 35 Delta I really mean just about 25 to 35 Delta I really mean just the< the short strike right the short strike the short strike right the short strike of< of where the short put strike is for of where the short put strike is for your< your put spread right so as you can see your put spread right so as you can see down< down here this is 34 Delta so anywhere down here this is 34 Delta so anywhere from< from 25 to 35 would be fine right so from 25 to 35 would be fine right so basically< basically the lower the Delta you're basically the lower the Delta you're going< going to have a higher win rate but going to have a higher win rate but you're< you're going to have you know a lower you're going to have you know a lower premium< premium and the risk reward ratio is not premium and the risk reward ratio is not going< going to be as good as if you were to going to be as good as if you were to choose< choose somewhere around 35 Delta right choose somewhere around 35 Delta right 35< 35 Delta you're going to have a better 35 Delta you're going to have a better risk< risk reward ratio you're going to get risk reward ratio you're going to get higher< higher premiums but your win rate is higher premiums but your win rate is going< going to be slightly lesser right but going to be slightly lesser right but overall< overall you can see generally it should overall you can see generally it should be< be around 80 to 90% mainly because be around 80 to 90% mainly because you're< you're choosing an underlying that keeps you're choosing an underlying that keeps going< going up right if it has positive drift going up right if it has positive drift you< you have pretty much skewed the win rate you have pretty much skewed the win rate in< in your favor now step three this is the in your favor now step three this is the key< key down here right once it reaches 21 key down here right once it reaches 21 DTE< DTE you want to close out the trade DTE you want to close out the trade regard< regard regardless of your p&amp;l right so regard regardless of your p&amp;l right so as< as you can see down here the studies as you can see down here the studies which< which I've shown you earlier if you were which I've shown you earlier if you were to< to close out at 21 DTE you generally to close out at 21 DTE you generally have< have a better performance than if you have a better performance than if you were< were to hold to expiration right so as were to hold to expiration right so as you< you can see at the top this chart down you can see at the top this chart down here< here 21 DTE performs slightly better here 21 DTE performs slightly better than< than holding all the way to expiration than holding all the way to expiration and< and your annual Roc which is your return and your annual Roc which is your return on< on capital is higher as well if you were on capital is higher as well if you were to< to manage it early so that is why you to manage it early so that is why you know< know if you are trading this Perpetual know if you are trading this Perpetual method< method you want to exit at 21 DTE and method you want to exit at 21 DTE and another< another important point is also you know another important point is also you know if< if you were to exit T DTE you reduce if you were to exit T DTE you reduce your< your chances of early assignment right your chances of early assignment right if< if you were to hold the expiration and if you were to hold the expiration and if< if it's in the money then you have to go if it's in the money then you have to go through< through the whole thing of unwinding through the whole thing of unwinding your< your assignment right you'll be long 100 your assignment right you'll be long 100 shares< shares and if you don't have you know shares and if you don't have you know enough< enough Capital to Long the 100 shares enough Capital to Long the 100 shares then< then you're going to get a margin call then you're going to get a margin call right< right especially if you're doing this on right especially if you're doing this on the< the index ETFs like spy if you're going the index ETFs like spy if you're going to< to Long 100 shares it's going to be a to Long 100 shares it's going to be a lot< lot of money right so you you really lot of money right so you you really need< need to either have a lot of money in need to either have a lot of money in your< your account or just play the Safe Way your account or just play the Safe Way exit< exit at 21 DTE now once you exit at 21 exit at 21 DTE now once you exit at 21 DTE< DTE this is how you make it Perpetual DTE this is how you make it Perpetual right< right basically you rinse and repeat you right basically you rinse and repeat you go< go back to step number one right and go back to step number one right and then< then you put on the put spread again then you put on the put spread again according< according to the same mechanics right according to the same mechanics right choose< choose 45 DTE s 25 to 35 Delta put choose 45 DTE s 25 to 35 Delta put spread< spread and then again once it reaches spread and then again once it reaches the< the 21 DTE close it out so you will the 21 DTE close it out so you will always< always be having a position in the always be having a position in the market< market okay so once you close one out market okay so once you close one out you< you quickly put on the next one again you quickly put on the next one again right< right so as you can see the studies right so as you can see the studies which< which they have done is all based on which they have done is all based on this< this right their studies is pretty much this right their studies is pretty much based< based on this strategy it's a Perpetual based on this strategy it's a Perpetual study< study right in the sense whereby they study right in the sense whereby they just< just put it on and then 21 DTE they take just put it on and then 21 DTE they take it< it off and put it on another one again it off and put it on another one again so< so the entry for this Perpetual method so the entry for this Perpetual method is< is rather random right they don't really is rather random right they don't really care< care where the market is the market can care where the market is the market can be< be at. all times high or alltime low or be at all times high or alltime low or somewhere< somewhere in the middle somewhere in the middle as< as long as it reaches 21 DTE they're as long as it reaches 21 DTE they're going< going to just put on the new put spread going to just put on the new put spread again< again so in this way you do not really again so in this way you do not really have< have this analysis paralysis it's very have this analysis paralysis it's very very< very systematic very very simple right very systematic very very simple right so< so all you got to do is set it up once so all you got to do is set it up once 21< 21 TT exit it and then enter it again 21 TT exit it and then enter it again over< over and over again so this is for over and over again so this is for method< method number one now method number two method number one now method number two is< is going to be selective right selective is going to be selective right selective means< means that we are not going to be having means that we are not going to be having a< a position perpetually in the market a position perpetually in the market right< right that means to say we will only right that means to say we will only find< find spots to enter into our put credit find spots to enter into our put credit spread< spread so for certain people they aren't spread so for certain people they aren't very< very comfortable to always have a very comfortable to always have a position< position in the market but they want to position in the market but they want to pick< pick their spots right so if they want pick their spots right so if they want to< to pick their spots and you are someone to pick their spots and you are someone like< like that then you could consider going like that then you could consider going for< for method number two and for method for method number two and for method number< number two because you're going to pick number two because you're going to pick your< your spots then it means that you need your spots then it means that you need to< to have quite a number of underlyings to to have quite a number of underlyings to trade< trade right because if you're only going trade right because if you're only going to< to choose one and if let's say for to choose one and if let's say for example< example the setup doesn't come for you example the setup doesn't come for you then< then you're going to wait a very long then you're going to wait a very long time< time before the setup comes again so time before the setup comes again so that< that is why for this you want to have that is why for this you want to have many< many different underlyings and mainly many different underlyings and mainly you< you choose this on individual stocks you choose this on individual stocks right< right so individual stocks this way you right so individual stocks this way you can< can have many choices and then see if can have many choices and then see if your< your setup comes so what is this setup your setup comes so what is this setup right< right so this setup involves a few steps right so this setup involves a few steps as< as well so first off step number one you as well so first off step number one you want< want to look for the overso condition want to look for the overso condition using< using the stochastic oscillator or RSI using the stochastic oscillator or RSI right< right so as you can see down here this right so as you can see down here this is< is the stochastic oscillator that I have is the stochastic oscillator that I have and< and again and again it's< it's very simple to set up right if it's very simple to set up right if you're< you're wondering what is the settings go you're wondering what is the settings go to< to my channel I already have a video on to my channel I already have a video on this< this I talk about it uh the title should this I talk about it uh the title should be< be something on stochastic oscillator be something on stochastic oscillator now< now you can also use the RSI for this now you can also use the RSI for this but< but basically both are the same right but basically both are the same right there's< there's no one that is better right so there's no one that is better right so basically< basically both will roughly have the basically both will roughly have the same< same reading most of the time so the same reading most of the time so the very< very first thing you want to look out very first thing you want to look out for< for is for this overso condition and for is for this overso condition and then< then once it's oversold you go to the then once it's oversold you go to the next< next step is you want to identify next step is you want to identify support< support levels right right so as you can support levels right right so as you can see< see down here I've drawn two support see down here I've drawn two support levels< levels down here so the idea here is levels down here so the idea here is that< that as it gets close to the support that as it gets close to the support level< level that you want to trade then this level that you want to trade then this is< is where you want to consider putting on is where you want to consider putting on your< your put credit spread so step number your put credit spread so step number three< three you'll be choosing the nearest 45 three you'll be choosing the nearest 45 DTE< DTE expiration date same thing as well DTE expiration date same thing as well and< and again you want to select as well the and again you want to select as well the 25< 25 to 35 Delta put spread but you want 25 to 35 Delta put spread but you want to< to choose the one that is below the to choose the one that is below the support< support level right you want to put your support level right you want to put your put< put spread below the support level so put spread below the support level so this< this way again you know you're putting this way again you know you're putting the< the odds in your favor right you have the odds in your favor right you have the< the stochastic oscillator or the RSI the stochastic oscillator or the RSI telling< telling you is oversold so the chances telling you is oversold so the chances of< of you going up is slightly higher than of you going up is slightly higher than it< it going down and then you place it it going down and then you place it below< below the support level because most of below the support level because most of the< the time you know when the prices touch the time you know when the prices touch a< a support level there is a at least a a support level there is a at least a better< better probability of it going up than better probability of it going up than it< it breaking through it right so again it breaking through it right so again we're< we're trying to put as many things in we're trying to put as many things in our< our favor putting the odds in our favor our favor putting the odds in our favor then< then step number five we want exit at 21 then step number five we want exit at 21 DTE< DTE regardless of your p&amp;l and and for DTE regardless of your p&amp;l and and for this< this the main reason is because you can this the main reason is because you can really< really control your losses right for really control your losses right for individual< individual stocks the market can really individual stocks the market can really move< move quite a bit right and if it really move quite a bit right and if it really moves< moves all the way down then you could moves all the way down then you could experience< experience a Max loss at expiration so experience a Max loss at expiration so that< that is why you know as much as possible that is why you know as much as possible we< we want to reduce the average loss so as we want to reduce the average loss so as you< you can see down here if you were to get you can see down here if you were to get out< out early at 21 DTE then your average out early at 21 DTE then your average loss< loss is going to be significantly lesser loss is going to be significantly lesser than< than those times where you hit those Max than those times where you hit those Max loss< loss right so you definitely want to loss right so you definitely want to exit< exit at 21 DTE if you want to manage exit at 21 DTE if you want to manage your< your risk well all right guys so if you your risk well all right guys so if you like< like this video or you found this video like this video or you found this video helpful< helpful I greatly appreciate it if you helpful I greatly appreciate it if you give< give me a thumbs up on this video by the give me a thumbs up on this video by the way< way

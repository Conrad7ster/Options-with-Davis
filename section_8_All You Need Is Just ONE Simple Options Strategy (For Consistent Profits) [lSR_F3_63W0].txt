Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you a I'm going to be sharing with you a simple< simple strategy to help you become simple strategy to help you become consistently< consistently profitable in options consistently profitable in options trading< trading especially if you're just trading especially if you're just starting< starting out right so if you're new to starting out right so if you're new to trading< trading options then I want to share trading options then I want to share with< with you this pretty simple option with you this pretty simple option strategy< strategy that you can use all right so strategy that you can use all right so what< what is this simple strategy so this what is this simple strategy so this simple< simple strategy is What's called the put simple strategy is What's called the put condom< condom I mean the put Condor put Condor condom I mean the put Condor put Condor this< this is the second time I said condom in this is the second time I said condom in another< another one of my videos I made that another one of my videos I made that mistake< mistake as well but no it's not the put mistake as well but no it's not the put condom< condom that is a totally different condom that is a totally different Channel< Channel this is the put Condor so you Channel this is the put Condor so you might< might be thinking what is the put Condor might be thinking what is the put Condor right< right it sounds a little bit like right it sounds a little bit like another< another strategy that is pretty similar another strategy that is pretty similar pretty< pretty familiar and that is the iron pretty familiar and that is the iron Condor< Condor now the iron Condor is a Condor now the iron Condor is a different< different strategy right is a totally different strategy right is a totally different< different strategy in the sense that ion different strategy in the sense that ion Condor< Condor has both puts and calls right you Condor has both puts and calls right you have< have both the put options and the call have both the put options and the call options< options whereas for the put Condor as options whereas for the put Condor as the< the name suggests that's only the put the name suggests that's only the put options< options so how does this strategy work options so how does this strategy work so< so first of all this put Condor starts so first of all this put Condor starts off< off with having a short put spread right off with having a short put spread right so< so one of the construct of this uh put so one of the construct of this uh put Condor< Condor is that there is a put credit Condor is that there is a put credit spread< spread also known as a bull put spread spread also known as a bull put spread so< so if you're familiar already with you so if you're familiar already with you know< know credit spreads then this shouldn't know credit spreads then this shouldn't be< be you know foreign to you right you be you know foreign to you right you should< should already know what this strategy should already know what this strategy is< is the short put spread you will receive is the short put spread you will receive premium< premium for for putting on this trade premium for for putting on this trade right< right so you want to put on a outof the right so you want to put on a outof the money< money short put spread now when you put money short put spread now when you put on< on the short put spread you're selling on the short put spread you're selling premium< premium right when you're selling premium right when you're selling premium< premium you have this money with this premium you have this money with this credit< credit you can use it to finance a long credit you can use it to finance a long put< put spread so this is where you have to put spread so this is where you have to pay< pay a premium so you notice there are pay a premium so you notice there are two< two strategies that's kind of like two strategies that's kind of like slightly< slightly different from each other right slightly different from each other right because< because the short put spread is bullish because the short put spread is bullish by< by Nature whereby you want the market by Nature whereby you want the market generally< generally to go up in a sense right I generally to go up in a sense right I mean< mean it can stay still go down a little mean it can stay still go down a little bit< bit but generally the strategy is if the bit but generally the strategy is if the market< market goes up you'll pretty much make market goes up you'll pretty much make money< money whereas the long put spread you money whereas the long put spread you actually< actually want the market to go down actually want the market to go down right< right if the market goes down then you right if the market goes down then you can< can make money so what you have down can make money so what you have down here< here is a combination of a bullish and a here is a combination of a bullish and a bearish< bearish strategy so the whole idea of bearish strategy so the whole idea of the< the put Condor is like this right so the put Condor is like this right so what< what we're doing is that we are using what we're doing is that we are using the< the short put spread to finance the the short put spread to finance the purchase< purchase of the long put spread so let purchase of the long put spread so let me< me just draw this box down here so this me just draw this box down here so this is< is where you get money right this is is where you get money right this is where< where you get the premium and then down where you get the premium and then down here< here this is where you pay the premium here this is where you pay the premium so< so when you receive this premium so so when you receive this premium so let's< let's say you receive a premium of $2 let's say you receive a premium of $2 size< size right that means you are rich right size right that means you are rich right okay< okay not really rich but at least you okay not really rich but at least you get< get some premium right and then you're get some premium right and then you're going< going to purchase P this foot spread going to purchase P this foot spread down< down here so you are going to pay out of down here so you are going to pay out of this< this premium Deb you have collected so this premium Deb you have collected so let's< let's say for example each dollar sign let's say for example each dollar sign is< is equal you remove $1 sign cancel out is equal you remove $1 sign cancel out this< this dollar basically you still have a this dollar basically you still have a net< net credit overall so let me give you an net credit overall so let me give you an example< example let's say you sold an out of the example let's say you sold an out of the money< money put spread and receive a dollar money put spread and receive a dollar for< for it so basically this one you sell it for it so basically this one you sell it they< they give you a dollar in terms of they give you a dollar in terms of Premium< Premium then with that $1 you use a part Premium then with that $1 you use a part of< of of it to buy a put spread so the put of of it to buy a put spread so the put spread< spread that you want to buy is actually spread that you want to buy is actually somewhere< somewhere around at the money right ATM somewhere around at the money right ATM just< just means at the money which means to just means at the money which means to say< say it's somewhere below where the say it's somewhere below where the current< current market price is so the current current market price is so the current market< market price will be somewhere down here market price will be somewhere down here so< so let me just mark it up down here if so let me just mark it up down here if you< you can see it so basically somewhere you can see it so basically somewhere around< around here right so par of my drawing around here right so par of my drawing it's< it's kind of a little bit difficult to it's kind of a little bit difficult to draw< draw but you get the point right so the draw but you get the point right so the whole< whole idea here is to use the credit whole idea here is to use the credit that< that you receive purchase the put spread that you receive purchase the put spread and< and overall you still get a credit right and overall you still get a credit right so< so this strategy is also considered a so this strategy is also considered a premium< premium selling strategy right because premium selling strategy right because overall< overall you still actually get a net overall you still actually get a net credit< credit right so net credit let's say for credit right so net credit let's say for example< example if you get 50 cents that is $50 example if you get 50 cents that is $50 per< per put Condor so this is really the per put Condor so this is really the construct< construct of the put Condor right you construct of the put Condor right you have< have one strategy at the bottom down have one strategy at the bottom down there< there is slightly bullish you want the there is slightly bullish you want the market< market basically to go up or not to go market basically to go up or not to go down< down so much right it can go down you're down so much right it can go down you're still< still profitable but if the market goes still profitable but. if the market goes all< all the way down here then that's not all the way down here then that's not what< what you really want but with the hood what you really want but with the hood debit< debit spread which is the long put debit spread which is the long put spread< spread now suddenly you have an spread now suddenly you have an incentive< incentive for the market to go down so incentive for the market to go down so when< when the market goes down you will when the market goes down you will actually< actually be making money on this portion actually be making money on this portion of< of the whole strategy so you can see of the whole strategy so you can see this< this is a little bit like the the beauty this is a little bit like the the beauty of< of this strategy because most of the of this strategy because most of the time< time let's just say if you just put on time let's just say if you just put on this< this put credit spread right let's say this put credit spread right let's say you< you do not have this and you put on the you do not have this and you put on the put< put credit spread now if the market put credit spread now if the market comes< comes down well most people right they comes down well most people right they will< will be panicking right because they will be panicking right because they think< think that oh it's coming down it's think that oh it's coming down it's about< about to test my short putut strike down about to test my short putut strike down here< here and if you were to take a look at here and if you were to take a look at the< the p&amp;l right now the p&amp;l will the p&amp;l right now the p&amp;l will definitely< definitely still show a loss right definitely still show a loss right because< because it hasn't reached expiration yet because it hasn't reached expiration yet right< right it's only an expiration if it right it's only an expiration if it lands< lands here then of course you'll be in a lands here then of course you'll be in a profit< profit but as it goes down you'll start profit but as it goes down you'll start to< to worry so this is one of the to worry so this is one of the psychology< psychology that us humans have right psychology that us humans have right especially< especially a lot of people who just get especially a lot of people who just get into< into trading for the first time they into trading for the first time they afraid< afraid you know to get tested especially afraid you know to get tested especially if< if the market comes down now when you at if the market comes down now when you at this< this portion down here ho ho suddenly this portion down here ho ho suddenly you< you are feeling excited that the market you are feeling excited that the market comes< comes down right of course you don't comes down right of course you don't want< want the market to go down too far down want the market to go down too far down but< but as long as it goes below our long but as long as it goes below our long put< put spread then this is where we can put spread then this is where we can actually< actually get a little bit more compared actually get a little bit more compared to< to if the market just kept going up to if the market just kept going up right< right so let's take a look at the profit right so let's take a look at the profit zones< zones for this strategy so how does the zones for this strategy so how does the profit< profit Zone look like so if you take a profit Zone look like so if you take a look< look at this what I've done is I've just look at this what I've done is I've just colorcoded< colorcoded it right I've colorcoded it colorcoded it right I've colorcoded it so< so you can see that this strategy so you can see that this strategy actually< actually does not have any risk to the actually does not have any risk to the upside< upside right especially you know if we upside right especially you know if we are< are in a boom Market especially right are in a boom Market especially right now< now we are currently in a boom Market now we are currently in a boom Market the< the market is going up and up and up the market is going up and up and up pretty< pretty much don't stop all the time at pretty much don't stop all the time at least< least you have this strategy it goes up least you have this strategy it goes up you< you don't have to worry you still have you don't have to worry you still have the< the profit or rather the the credit you the profit or rather the the credit you receive< receive from putting on this whole receive from putting on this whole position< position right remember you're only position right remember you're only using< using you know a part of it right you're using you know a part of it right you're not< not going to use all of it so even not going to use all of it so even though< though if the market goes up you're though if the market goes up you're still< still going to be in profit although still going to be in profit although it's< it's minimum now if the market actually it's minimum now if the market actually comes< comes down and it enters our Max profit comes down and it enters our Max profit Zone< Zone this is where you can actually make Zone this is where you can actually make even< even more right because you have this even more right because you have this long< long put spread down here is going to long put spread down here is going to help< help you make the profits on the way help you make the profits on the way down< down now of course we want it to stay down now of course we want it to stay within< within this Max profit Zone down here within this Max profit Zone down here because< because this is where we make the most because this is where we make the most from< from this strategy right so if it goes from this strategy right so if it goes up< up at least we still make something up at least we still make something right< right doesn't matter we still make some right doesn't matter we still make some profit< profit it comes down yes we can make a profit it comes down yes we can make a little< little bit more but we do not want it to little bit more but we do not want it to go< go all the way too far down past this go all the way too far down past this point< point down here right because this is point down here right because this is the< the point where we start to get into a the point where we start to get into a loss< loss right so as you can see down here loss right so as you can see down here this< this loss down here starts to gradually this loss down here starts to gradually increase< increase as you know the underlying increase as you know the underlying starts< starts to go down now past this point starts to go down now past this point where< where we have our long put this is where where we have our long put this is where the< the max loss zone is so basically we've the max loss zone is so basically we've already< already kept the max risk down here so already kept the max risk down here so if< if the market continues to go all the if the market continues to go all the way< way down let me just remove this drawing way down let me just remove this drawing if< if the market continues to go all the if the market continues to go all the way< way down it can even go to zero but we way down it can even go to zero but we don't< don't really have to worry then because don't really have to worry then because we've< we've already kept our loss to this we've already kept our loss to this spread< spread now here so we cannot lose more spread now here so we cannot lose more than< than the risk we put up front so even than the risk we put up front so even though< though you know if the market goes to though you know if the market goes to zero< zero if the risk we put up front let's zero if the risk we put up front let's say< say is $500 that's the most you can lose say is $500 that's the most you can lose so< so in a sense this is also beginner so in a sense this is also beginner friendly< friendly so now let's take a look at the friendly so now let's take a look at the p&amp;l< p&amp;l graph down here so the p&amp;l graph p&amp;l graph down here so the p&amp;l graph shows< shows you how your p&amp;l will look like shows you how your p&amp;l will look like you< you know at different points in time and you know at different points in time and also< also at different price levels so on the also at different price levels so on the left< left hand side down here right so from left hand side down here right so from this< this point onwards this left hand side this point onwards this left hand side this< this is your p&amp;l right this is where you this is your p&amp;l right this is where you get< get to see whether you make money or get to see whether you make money or lose< lose money so this is the $0 line lose money so this is the $0 line anything< anything above there you are in profit anything above there you are in profit anything< anything below there you are in a loss anything below there you are in a loss so< so one thing about this strategy you so one thing about this strategy you will< will notice first of all is that it has will notice first of all is that it has a< a pretty high wind rate right it's 87. 1% a pretty high wind rate right it's 87.

1% but< but again it really comes down to how but again it really comes down to how you< you construct it and I will show you a you construct it and I will show you a little< little bit later on how you can you know little bit later on how you can you know change< change the strikes to you know increase change the strikes to you know increase or< or decrease the win rate right so or decrease the win rate right so basically< basically all you got to know first of basically all you got to know first of all< all is that this is actually a pretty all is that this is actually a pretty high< high win rate so when you have a high high win rate so when you have a high win< win rate strategy then you're able to win rate strategy then you're able to consistently< consistently be profitable right you can consistently be profitable right you can constantly< constantly grow your account as well now constantly grow your account as well now the< the next thing you will notice is that the next thing you will notice is that the< the risk reward usually is always the the risk reward usually is always the case< case whereby you're risking more than case whereby you're risking more than what< what you make right it's just this the what you make right it's just this the way< way it is right because there's always a way it is right because there's always a trade-off< trade-off right you want a high win rate trade-off right you want a high win rate you're< you're naturally going to have a poorer you're naturally going to have a poorer risk< risk to reward but the most important risk to. reward but the most important thing< thing is where you actually put this thing is where you actually put this spread< spread down here so you can put it at a spread down here so you can put it at a spread< spread strategically when you enter to a spread strategically when you enter to a point< point whereby you do not really get into point whereby you do not really get into this< this loss Zone that often okay so now we this loss Zone that often okay so now we know< know how this put Condor strategy know how this put Condor strategy actually< actually work how do you actually actually work how do you actually construct< construct it so I'm going to give you construct it so I'm going to give you five< five steps to do it by the way if you five steps to do it by the way if you like< like this video so far Please Subscribe like this video so far Please Subscribe and< and also click the thumbs up button and and also click the thumbs up button and also< also do get your free copy of the also do get your free copy of the options< options income blueprint where I share options income blueprint where I share the< the top three options strategies that the top three options strategies that help< help you generate a consistent income help you generate a consistent income each< each month trading just one to two hours each month trading just one to two hours a< a day right so if you want to go ahead a day right so if you want to go ahead get< get this copy just head on over to get this copy just head on over to options< options with davis. com blueprint all options with davis.

com blueprint all right< right back to the video the very first right back to the video the very first step< step is to choose the underlying right step is to choose the underlying right so< so generally this strategy can be placed so generally this strategy can be placed on< on any underlying that you want you want on any underlying that you want you want to< to put it on stocks you can you want to to put it on stocks you can you want to put< put on index you can my preference is put on index you can my preference is always< always to put it on the indexes mainly always to put it on the indexes mainly because< because indexes have positive drift so because indexes have positive drift so one< one thing you need to understand about one thing you need to understand about the< the strategies that you're trading so the strategies that you're trading so for< for this strategy where is is the risk for this strategy where is is the risk we< we always need to think about where is we always need to think about where is our< our downside where is the worst scenario our downside where is the worst scenario that< that can happen so the worst scenario that can happen so the worst scenario that< that can happen is on the downside that that can happen is on the downside that means< means to say if the market keeps going means to say if the market keeps going down< down then we are going to lose money down then we are going to lose money right< right so it's very important especially right so it's very important especially when< when I'm trading any strategies that when I'm trading any strategies that have< have risk to the downside is that I have risk to the downside is that I choose< choose an underline that has positive choose an underline that has positive drift< drift now positive drift I mentioned drift now positive drift I mentioned this< this in a number of my videos as well this in a number of my videos as well again< again it's very Paramount to the again it's very Paramount to the strategy< strategy that we put on because a strategy that we put on because a strategy< strategy is a whole right it's not just strategy is a whole right it's not just about< about the options that you put on right about the options that you put on right how< how this strategy work it also has to do how this strategy work it also has to do with< with the underlying that you choose so with the underlying that you choose so since< since this strategy only has rised to since this strategy only has rised to the< the downside I want to choose an the downside I want to choose an underlying< underlying that I know that over the underlying that I know that over the longterm< longterm will keep going up that is what longterm will keep going up that is what is< is called a positive drift that means is called a positive drift that means the< the market wants to just keep going up the market wants to just keep going up over< over time so to find such kind of over time so to find such kind of underlying< underlying there's no better underlying underlying there's no better underlying than< than the indexes right because the index than the indexes right because the index generally< generally just keeps going up and up and generally just keeps going up and up and if< if you want to trade stocks you can as if you want to trade stocks you can as well< well it's just that with stocks you well it's just that with stocks you really< really need to choose the right really need to choose the right underline< underline because there are certain underline because there are certain stocks< stocks you know if it keeps going all stocks you know if it keeps going all the< the way down to zero then no matter how the way down to zero then no matter how high< high of a wi rate it is right because high of a wi rate it is right because the< the probability already baked in right the probability already baked in right it's< it's about 87% 91% so on and so forth it's about 87% 91% so on and so forth but< but if it's going to zero you're going but if it's going to zero you're going to< to just keep losing over time so my to just keep losing over time so my preference< preference is indexes and there are two preference is indexes and there are two ways< ways to go about this because you have ways to go about this because you have the< the American style options and you have the American style options and you have the< the European style options if you want the European style options if you want to< to keep things simple you do not want to to keep things simple you do not want to roll< roll it you do not want to you know leg roll it you do not want to you know leg in< in and leg out just go for the European in and leg out just go for the European style< style options which is the cash settle style options which is the cash settle index< index options for example SPX rat or XSP index options for example SPX rat or XSP MBR< MBR so again depends on the size of your MBR so again depends on the size of your account< account right so basically if you go for account right so basically if you go for this< this cash set of index options you can this cash set of index options you can just< just put on this strategy leave it to just put on this strategy leave it to expiration< expiration you don't don't have to worry expiration you don't don't have to worry about< about being early assigned or assigned about being early assigned or assigned any< any shares all right so step number one any shares all right so step number one choose< choose a positive drift underline now choose a positive drift underline now step< step number two choose your DTE so I step number two choose your DTE so I created< created a few videos before where I created a few videos before where I didn't< didn't really talk about the DTE because didn't really talk about the DTE because a< a lot of my videos actually already a lot of my videos actually already talked< talked about DTE so I thought that my talked about DTE so I thought that my viewers< viewers are probably informed apparently viewers are probably informed apparently I< I was wrong right because some people I was wrong right because some people still< still don't know what is the DTE that I still don't know what is the DTE that I like< like to choose and maybe for those new like to choose and maybe for those new viewers< viewers it's good for me to reiterate viewers it's good for me to reiterate again< again so every video probably I will again so every video probably I will have< have to talk about the DTE by the way have to talk about the DTE by the way DTE< DTE stands for days to expiration that DTE stands for days to expiration that means< means the expiration date of the options means the expiration date of the options right< right so generally I like to go for right so generally I like to go for somewhere< somewhere around 45 days onwards to somewhere around 45 days onwards to maybe< maybe 65 maximum 70 because of the edge maybe 65 maximum 70 because of the edge that< that we are going to have so what is that we are going to have so what is this< this Edge that we have so I already this Edge that we have so I already recorded< recorded a video again I'm talk about recorded a video again I'm talk about the< the number one secret to be consistent the number one secret to be consistent instantly< instantly profitable trading options and instantly profitable trading options and that< that is the fact that the realiz move is that is the fact that the realiz move is most< most often the time lesser than the most often the time lesser than the expected< expected move so if you don't know about expected move so if you don't know about this< this concept just go to my channel and this concept just go to my channel and watch< watch that video and you will fully watch that video and you will fully understand< understand it right but basically it's understand it right but basically it's important< important for us that if you want an add important for us that if you want an add trading< trading options you definitely want to trading options you definitely want to make< make sure that you're choosing the right make sure that you're choosing the right DTE< DTE that has this Edge so what is the DTE that has this Edge so what is the right< right DTE basically you can see from right DTE basically you can see from this< this study down here here so this study this study down here here so this study shows< shows of the spy and it shows the shows of the spy and it shows the expected< expected Move versus the realized move expected Move versus the realized move and< and this data have uh dated or rather and this data have uh dated or rather this< this Studies have gone back all the way this Studies have gone back all the way since< since 1993 so it's a pretty significant since 1993 so it's a pretty significant study< study set so a lot of data has gone into study set so a lot of data has gone into it< it and what they have found that if you it and what they have found that if you were< were to choose the DTE right or rather were to choose the DTE right or rather you< you know if you hold the trade for 30 you know if you hold the trade for 30 days< days or less what you will find is that days or less what you will find is that the< the expected move is not bigger than the the expected move is not bigger than the realized< realized move that means there's no Edge realized move that means there's no Edge there< there that's not where our Edge is right there that's not where our Edge is right we< we want the edge whereby the expected we want the edge whereby the expected move< move is actually bigger than the move is actually bigger than the realized< realized move so you can see only from realized move so you can see only from 45< 45 days onwards that's where you have 45 days onwards that's where you have the< the edge so inevitably there will always the edge so inevitably there will always be< be some people that will ask me Davis be some people that will ask me Davis can< can I do this on the weekly options can can I do this on the weekly options can I< I do this on the Zero DTE options hey I do this on the Zero DTE options hey you< you can put this on any time frame you you can put this on any time frame you want< want if there's a 1 second option I want if there's a 1 second option I pretty< pretty much believe that you will put it pretty much believe that you will put it on< on as well if you want to right there on as well if you want to right there just< just some people that want to realize just some people that want to realize this< this win or loss very quickly right this win or loss very quickly right instant< instant gratification now if you're the instant gratification now if you're the kind< kind of person that likes that you can kind of person that likes that you can go< go ahead and try right whether it has an go ahead and try right whether it has an edge< edge in the long term we don't really edge in the long term we don't really know< know right but based on this study know right but based on this study itself< itself based on this data it's safe to itself based on this data it's safe to say< say that from 45 days onwards that's say that from 45 days onwards that's where< where our Edge comes that's why you know where our Edge comes that's why you know we< we generally have a higher win rate than we generally have a higher win rate than the< the theoretical win rate because again the theoretical win rate because again of< of this all right so this is step number of this all right so this is step number two< two now step number three you want. to two now step number three you want to start< start constructing your short putut start constructing your short putut spread< spread first right we always construct spread first right we always construct the< the part where we receive the credit so the part where we receive the credit so remember< remember this strategy is whereby we use remember this strategy is whereby we use the< the credit to purchase a debit spread the credit to purchase a debit spread which< which is the put debit spread so when which is the put debit spread so when you< you construct this short put spread the you construct this short put spread the first< first thing you want to do is find the first thing you want to do is find the short< short strike right the short strike how short strike right the short strike how we< we choose it is pretty much determined we choose it is pretty much determined by< by Delta so one thing you need to have by Delta so one thing you need to have when< when you construct this is to have this when you construct this is to have this Delta< Delta column on your option chain right Delta column on your option chain right so< so generally you want to go for so generally you want to go for somewhere< somewhere around 15 to 20 Deltas but somewhere around 15 to 20 Deltas but this< this is just a guideline right so one this is just a guideline right so one thing< thing you need to understand is the thing you need to understand is the relation< relation between Delta and the relation between Delta and the probability< probability of win right the probability probability of win right the probability of< of profit now the Delta gives us a very of profit now the Delta gives us a very estimate< estimate indication as to what is the estimate indication as to what is the win< win rate of the strategy right so to win rate of the strategy right so to speak< speak right because the Delta just gives speak right because the Delta just gives you< you a representation of you know what's you a representation of you know what's the< the chances of it being in the money at the chances of it being in the money at expiration< expiration so if it says 20 Delta it expiration so if it says 20 Delta it just< just means that there's a 20% chance of just means that there's a 20% chance of this< this strike being in the money by this strike being in the money by expiration< expiration right so on the opposite end expiration right so on the opposite end if< if you have 20% chance of being in the if you have 20% chance of being in the money< money that means you're going to lose money that means you're going to lose money< money it means to say you have a roughly money it means to say you have a roughly 80%< 80% win rate on this strategy so that is 80% win rate on this strategy so that is how< how we want to choose our short strike how we want to choose our short strike right< right so for example if you're somebody right so for example if you're somebody that< that want a much higher win rate then that want a much higher win rate then this< this is where you want to go for a lower this is where you want to go for a lower Delta< Delta right right now one thing to Delta right right now one thing to understand< understand is that there's always a understand is that there's always a trade-off< trade-off please do not ask me Davis trade-off please do not ask me Davis what< what is the best Delta to choose for what is the best Delta to choose for this< this because there's no such thing as this because there's no such thing as the< the best right it all comes down to you the best right it all comes down to you what< what you're comfortable with and what what you're comfortable with and what you< you think is the Outlook of the underly you think is the Outlook of the underly so< so basically the trade-off is this right so basically the trade-off is this right if< if you go for a very low Delta let's say if you go for a very low Delta let's say 15< 15 Delta and let's say lower than that 15 Delta and let's say lower than that then< then you're going to get a higher wind then you're going to get a higher wind rate< rate right because the Delta is lower rate right because the Delta is lower the< the chances of it being in the money is the chances of it being in the money is lower< lower right so naturally your wind rate lower right so naturally your wind rate is< is high higher so if you go for this is high higher so if you go for this very< very high win rate you'll naturally get very high win rate you'll naturally get lesser< lesser premium so you notice down here lesser premium so you notice down here 15< 15 Delta your premium is so little 15 Delta your premium is so little compared< compared to this one down here right compared to this one down here right $262< $262 on the bit down here versus $349 on $262 on the bit down here versus $349 on the< the bit over here so what this affects the bit over here so what this affects is< is the premium you have to actually is the premium you have to actually purchase< purchase your debit spread your put purchase your debit spread your put spread< spread which means to say the Lesser spread which means to say the Lesser credit< credit you have maybe the smaller width credit you have maybe the smaller width you< you have to purchase this uh put debit you have to purchase this uh put debit spread< spread or maybe you have to buy it spread or maybe you have to buy it slightly< slightly further away right if you go slightly further away right if you go closer< closer to where the current market price closer to where the current market price is< is let's say you go for a higher Delta is let's say you go for a higher Delta then< then with a higher Delta you have more then with a higher Delta you have more premium< premium more premium you can use it to premium more premium you can use it to finance< finance the purchase of a bigger debit finance the purchase of a bigger debit spread< spread right that means your more spread right that means your more defensive< defensive visual structure so again it defensive visual structure so again it all< all comes down you know what you're all comes down you know what you're comfortable< comfortable with how you want to comfortable with how you want to construct< construct now on the other hand you can construct now on the other hand you can even< even go up to 30 Deltas right for even go up to 30 Deltas right for example< example if you are very uh confident example if you are very uh confident that< that you know the market is pretty that you know the market is pretty bullish< bullish and you just want to have that bullish and you just want to have that slight< slight hatch in terms of the put debit slight hatch in terms of the put debit spread< spread you can go for a Higher One 30 spread you can go for a Higher One 30 Deltas< Deltas right with 30 Deltas you're going Deltas right with 30 Deltas you're going to< to get much more premium and you can to get much more premium and you can construct< construct a slightly bigger debit spread construct a slightly bigger debit spread the< the put debit spread compared to these the put debit spread compared to these two< two structures all right so this is two structures all right so this is about< about the short strike so the next one about the short strike so the next one we're< we're going to be talking about how we're going to be talking about how we're< we're going to find this long strike we're going to find this long strike right< right how do we choose this so this is right how do we choose this so this is all< all dependent on your Capital allocation all dependent on your Capital allocation your your your risk< risk management so if for example your risk management so if for example your risk< risk per trade is $500 per trade then risk per trade is $500 per trade then all< all you have to do automatically is just all you have to do automatically is just go< go $5 wide right so you can see this is go $5 wide right so you can see this is 477< 477 you stretch it to 472 this is a $5 477 you stretch it to 472 this is a $5 wide< wide spread so you know that the max wide spread so you know that the max loss< loss cannot go more than this $5 wide loss cannot go more than this $5 wide spread< spread right so if the market goes all spread right so if the market goes all the< the way down the most you can lose $5 the way down the most you can lose $5 Point< Point widespread which is500 $1 every Point widespread which is500 $1 every point< point is $100 in Risk $500 minus of point is $100 in Risk $500 minus of whatever< whatever credit you receive right so if whatever credit you receive right so if you< you receive a dollar in credit which is you receive a dollar in credit which is $100< $100 that means to say your max risk is $100 that means to say your max risk is $500< $500 minus $100 which is $400 right so $500 minus $100 which is $400 right so all< all you got to know is that if your max all you got to know is that if your max risk< risk is $500 stretch to $5 if your max risk is $500 stretch to $5 if your max risk< risk is $1,000 stretch to $10 wide as risk is $1,000 stretch to $10 wide as simple< simple as that so now that we have simple as that so now that we have already< already constructed the short put spread already constructed the short put spread now< now it's time to con conru the long put now it's time to con conru the long put spread< spread so the long put spread this is spread so the long put spread this is where< where we want to go to roughly at the where we want to go to roughly at the money< money right so as you can see down here money right so as you can see down here this< this is where it's at the money right this is where it's at the money right 4099< 4099 is currently where it's at the 4099 is currently where it's at the money< money now there's a slight shaded color money now there's a slight shaded color down< down here I'm not sure if you can see on down here I'm not sure if you can see on your< your screen but this is shaded to tell your screen but this is shaded to tell you< you that from $ 499 onwards all the way you that from $ 499 onwards all the way up< up right on the option chain is all the up right on the option chain is all the way< way down but in terms of numeric is all way down but in terms of numeric is all the< the way up this is where it's considered the way up this is where it's considered in< in the money right so generally we do in the money right so generally we do not< not want to buy this put spread that's not want to buy this put spread that's in< in the money but rather around at the in the money but rather around at the money< money or out the money so the very first money or out the money so the very first strike< strike that we want to choose is the strike that we want to choose is the long< long strike so the long strike I'll long strike so the long strike I'll generally< generally want to choose somewhere generally want to choose somewhere around< around at the money as you can see down around at the money as you can see down here< here this is the first strike 498 is the here this is the first strike 498 is the first< first strike that is just outside of first strike that is just outside of where< where the current market price is so the where the current market price is so the current< current market price probably is around current market price probably is around $4. 99< $4.

99 so anything below that is $4. 99 so anything below that is considered< considered all the money or at the money considered all the money or at the money right< right depending how you want to classify right depending how you want to classify that< that so 49 it is this strike that I'll that so 49 it is this strike that I'll choose< choose first the next is to see how big choose first the next is to see how big of< of a construct I can get for this put of a construct I can get for this put debit< debit spread basically how wide is the debit spread basically how wide is the width< width so generally I'll start off with width so generally I'll start off with one< one point wides spread first then see one point wides spread first then see what< what is the overall credit so as what is the overall credit so as mentioned< mentioned earlier on let's say if you mentioned earlier on let's say if you receive< receive a dollar for the credit spread receive a dollar for the credit spread which< which you have constructed in step three which you have constructed in step three then< then you want to look for a put debit then you want to look for a put debit spread< spread that is less than a dollar so spread that is less than a dollar so let's< let's take a look at this right so for let's take a look at this right so for example< example for this if you were to minus example for this if you were to minus off< off each other maybe it's around 40 off each other maybe it's around 40 cents< cents thereabouts right so let's say for cents thereabouts right so let's say for example< example ballpark is about 40 cents so example ballpark is about 40 cents so what< what that means is that you will at what that means is that you will at least< least now have a net credit of 60 C so least now have a net credit of 60 C so this< this will be your construct you can this will be your construct you can definitely< definitely go with this now if you want definitely go with this now if you want a< a little bit more defensive structure a little bit more defensive structure which< which means to say you want to make which means to say you want to make slightly< slightly more if the market goes down slightly more if the market goes down into< into this Max profit Zone what you could into this Max profit Zone what you could do< do is try and stretch this one more try do is try and stretch this one more try right< right to try the 496 then you see hey right to try the 496 then you see hey can< can you actually still get an overall can you actually still get an overall credit< credit if you can and you want it to be credit if you can and you want it to be more< more defensive you can go with this now more defensive you can go with this now what< what if you construct this and it's one what if you construct this and it's one point< point why just at the money but you point why just at the money but you notice< notice that is actually not a credit and notice that is actually not a credit and it's< it's actually a debit so if that's the it's actually a debit so if that's the case< case what it means is that you know case what it means is that you know you're< you're not getting as much credit as you you're not getting as much credit as you want< want maybe because your spread on the want maybe because your spread on the other< other side is too small maybe you only other side is too small maybe you only go< go for two points wide kind of spread go for two points wide kind of spread where< where the overall credit is not big where the overall credit is not big enough< enough or maybe you've gone for too far enough or maybe you've gone for too far of< of a Delta right maybe you go for of a Delta right maybe you go for something< something like five Delta then of course something like five Delta then of course you're< you're not going to get that much credit you're not going to get that much credit so< so the first thing is you can always so the first thing is you can always adjust< adjust the short putut spread right adjust the short putut spread right adjust< adjust It Go for slightly higher Delta adjust It Go for slightly higher Delta go< go for a wider width if your risk allows go for a wider width if your risk allows it< it and you should be able to get more it and you should be able to get more credit< credit now let's say for example you credit now let's say for example you already< already gotten a good credit down there already gotten a good credit down there but< but you notice that down here you don't but you notice that down here you don't get< get that much overall credit let's say get that much overall credit let's say for< for example this spread down here cost for example this spread down here cost ents< ents and overall your net credit is 20 ents and overall your net credit is 20 cents< cents which is $20 per foot spread and cents which is $20 per foot spread and you< you don't like that it's so little so you don't like that it's so little so here's< here's what you can do so let me just here's what you can do so let me just remove< remove this drawings first so what you remove this drawings first so what you can< can do instead is you will have to shift can do instead is you will have to shift this< this whole spread down here all the way this whole spread down here all the way down< down in terms of numeric right on option down in terms of numeric right on option chain< chain you're basically shifing it up so chain you're basically shifing it up so let's< let's say for example you go for the let's say for example you go for the 49491< 49491 put debit spread so if you go for 49491 put debit spread so if you go for this< this what you notice is that it will this what you notice is. that it will generally< generally be cheaper to purchase then generally be cheaper to purchase then this< this one down here because remember as this one down here because remember as it< it goes further out the money your it goes further out the money your premium< premium drops right if you take a look premium drops right if you take a look at< at the premium down here is much lesser at the premium down here is much lesser than< than here so that is why you're going to than here so that is why you're going to be< be able to construct a put debit spread be able to construct a put debit spread with< with the same width as this one down with the same width as this one down here< here right but it's going to be cheaper here right but it's going to be cheaper to< to purchase now the trade-off is that to purchase now the trade-off is that now< now your max profit zone is going to be now your max profit zone is going to be smaller< smaller so remember this is how our p&amp;l smaller so remember this is how our p&amp;l graph< graph looks like so if you recall this graph looks like so if you recall this is< is our p&amp;l graph and this this is where is our p&amp;l graph and this this is where the< the current market price is so I'll put the current market price is so I'll put M< M for the current market price this is M for the current market price this is if< if you choose the at the money put debit if you choose the at the money put debit spread< spread now if you were to choose this spread now if you were to choose this one< one down here all of a sudden now this one down here all of a sudden now this will< will be shifted so now maybe it will will be shifted so now maybe it will look< look something like this right so down look something like this right so down here< here your max profit zone is going to be here your max profit zone is going to be smaller< smaller but you're still going to be smaller but you're still going to be profitable< profitable even though if the market profitable even though if the market land< land somewhere around this Zone down land somewhere around this Zone down here< here right so again all you got to do is here right so again all you got to do is just< just manipulate the strikes change it up just manipulate the strikes change it up a< a little bit to see the kind of a little bit to see the kind of construct< construct that you can get now that you construct that you can get now that you have< have already constructed both your short have already constructed both your short putut< putut spread and your long putut spread putut spread and your long putut spread you< you already have the put Condor on you already have the put Condor on congratulations< congratulations but you're not through congratulations but you're not through yet< yet right the next thing you want to yet right the next thing you want to make< make sure ensure that you have a net make sure ensure that you have a net credit< credit because if you don't have a net credit because if you don't have a net credit< credit then it's going to be a debit credit then it's going to be a debit trade< trade if it's debit trade that means to trade if it's debit trade that means to say< say that it's going to have pretty much say that it's going to have pretty much a< a low win rate right because if the a low win rate right because if the market< market goes up it's going to be a loss market goes up it's going to be a loss so< so you want to make sure that when you so you want to make sure that when you put< put on the trade you take a look at the put on the trade you take a look at the slider< slider bar down here so this is the slider bar down here so this is the tasty< tasty trade platform right I'm sure tasty trade platform right I'm sure other< other platforms should have this where other platforms should have this where they< they tell you what is the mid price so they tell you what is the mid price so the< the mid price will tell you whether it's the mid price will tell you whether it's a< a credit or debit now if you see that a credit or debit now if you see that it's< it's a credit good to go

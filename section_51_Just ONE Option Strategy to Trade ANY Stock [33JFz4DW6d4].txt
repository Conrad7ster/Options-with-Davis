=============================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you an I'm going to be sharing with you an option< option strategy that you can trade with option strategy that you can trade with any< any stock well at least for the most any stock well at least for the most part< part most of the stocks that you can part most of the stocks that you can trade< trade this strategy and also really trade this strategy and also really depends< depends on whether you can have the depends on whether you can have the right< right construct on that stock well more right construct on that stock well more on< on that later but for this strategy on that later but for this strategy there< there are a few steps and I want to walk there are a few steps and I want to walk you< you through that right so the very first you through that right so the very first step< step that you want to do is to find step that you want to do is to find either< either uptrending stock or downtrending either uptrending stock or downtrending stocks< stocks so what I mean by uptrending or stocks so what I mean by uptrending or downtrending< downtrending well basically what we're downtrending well basically what we're looking< looking at is the wave pattern right so looking at is the wave pattern right so basically< basically an uptrending stock will look basically an uptrending stock will look something< something like this so as you can see something like this so as you can see here< here it forms this higher high and here it forms this higher high and higher< higher low pattern right so as you can higher low pattern right so as you can see< see down here every time it goes up and see down here every time it goes up and then< then comes down this is where it forms a then comes down this is where it forms a peak< peak so we call this a higher high so peak so we call this a higher high so you< you can see that each time it goes a you can see that each time it goes a little< little bit higher it forms this higher little bit higher it forms this higher high< high at the same time when it comes down high at the same time when it comes down it< it forms what's called a higher low it forms what's called a higher low right< right so as you can see down here all right so as you can see down here all the< the lows are basically progressively the lows are basically progressively higher< higher and higher each time same as the higher and higher each time same as the high< high so when you see such kind of high so when you see such kind of patterns< patterns this is what you call an patterns this is what you call an uptrending< uptrending stock and it's important to uptrending stock and it's important to identify< identify this kind of pattern if you identify this kind of pattern if you want< want to trade bullish strategies now want to trade bullish strategies now likewise< likewise on the other hand if you want likewise on the other hand if you want to< to find bearish strategies you want to to find bearish strategies you want to trade< trade bearish strategies then it would trade bearish strategies then it would be< be better to to place those trades on be better to to place those trades on what's< what's called a downtrending stocks so what's called a downtrending stocks so in< in up trending stocks we're looking at in up trending stocks we're looking at higher< higher highs and higher lows but for higher highs and higher lows but for down< down trending stocks it's the opposite down trending stocks it's the opposite so< so you want to basically see this lower so you want to basically see this lower high< high pattern so that means you see that high pattern so that means you see that the< the highs is progressively generally the highs is progressively generally getting< getting lower and lower each time same getting lower and lower each time same as< as the lows so this is where down as the lows so this is where down trending< trending stocks will form lower highs trending stocks will form lower highs and< and lower lows so same thing if you want and lower lows so same thing if you want to< to trade the market to the downside then to trade the market to the downside then if< if you find one of these downtrending if you find one of these downtrending stocks< stocks putting on a bearish strategy stocks putting on a bearish strategy will< will generally have a better outcome will generally have a better outcome than< than if you were to find one on an than if you were to find one on an uptrending< uptrending stock all right so this is uptrending stock all right so this is the< the very first step that you want to do the very first step that you want to do now< now once youve already identified this now once youve already identified this uptrending< uptrending and downtrending stocks The uptrending and downtrending stocks The Next< Next Step you want to do is to use an Next Step you want to do is to use an indicator< indicator that helps you identify either indicator that helps you identify either oversold< oversold or overbought condition right oversold or overbought condition right so< so there are quite a number of so there are quite a number of indicators< indicators that can help you either indicators that can help you either identify< identify this oversold or overbought identify this oversold or overbought condition< condition but for my slide down here as condition but for my slide down here as you< you can see the one that I'm using is you can see the one that I'm using is what's< what's called a stochastic indicator what's called a stochastic indicator right< right so I've created a video all about right so I've created a video all about this< this already I show you the settings this already I show you the settings that< that you can use and you can just go to that you can use and you can just go to my< my channel and search for stochastic and my channel and search for stochastic and there's< there's just one video on that right so there's just one video on that right so for< for this example I'll be using the for this example I'll be using the stochastic< stochastic to identify whether the stochastic to identify whether the market< market is oversold or overbought right market is oversold or overbought right so< so here's the thing when when you are so here's the thing when when you are finding< finding this uptrending stocks you want finding this uptrending stocks you want to< to find overso conditions right so if to find overso conditions right so if the< the market is trending up what we're the market is trending up what we're trying< trying to do is find these times where trying to do is find these times where the< the market comes down right you can see the market comes down right you can see the< the market comes down momentarily and the market comes down momentarily and this< this is where we want to also see the this is where we want to also see the stochastic< stochastic whether it's overso right so stochastic whether it's overso right so basically< basically if the line goes below this basically if the line goes below this red< red line at the bottom this is when it's red line at the bottom this is when it's considered< considered oversold which means to say considered oversold which means to say that< that the market is kind of sold off that the market is kind of sold off quite< quite a bit and there's at least least a quite a bit and there's at least least a higher< higher probability of the market higher probability of the market continuing< continuing to go back up in its uptrend continuing to go back up in its uptrend fashion< fashion than it going down right so that fashion than it going down right so that is< is why if we want to trade to the upside is why if we want to trade to the upside then< then it will be better to find an overs then it will be better to find an overs soap< soap condition on an uptrend compared to soap condition on an uptrend compared to find< find an overs condition on a downtrend find an overs condition on a downtrend because< because generally if you find it on the because generally if you find it on the downtrend< downtrend every time it's oversold downtrend every time it's oversold there's< there's a good chance that it's going to there's a good chance that it's going to continue< continue to go down again after there continue to go down again after there right< right because the trend is down so we do right because the trend is down so we do not< not want to find oversold in a not want to find oversold in a downtrending< downtrending market or a down trending downtrending market or a down trending stock< stock but rather oversold in an stock but rather oversold in an uptrending< uptrending stock NOW likewise we want to uptrending stock NOW likewise we want to find< find the overbought condition in a find the overbought condition in a downtrending< downtrending stock so that means first downtrending stock so that means first you< you need to see that the stock is doing you need to see that the stock is doing something< something like this right then from something like this right then from there< there you want to take a look at this there you want to take a look at this stochastic< stochastic to see that each time when it stochastic to see that each time when it comes< comes up a little bit right momentarily comes up a little bit right momentarily when< when it comes up we want to identify when it comes up we want to identify this< this overboard reading right as you can this overboard reading right as you can see< see down here overboard here and then see down here overboard here and then overboard< overboard here as well so again if you overboard here as well so again if you find< find this over overboard in down trading find this over overboard in down trading stocks< stocks then if you trade it to the stocks then if you trade it to the downside< downside that at least there is a better downside that at least there is a better likelihood< likelihood of it continuing to go down likelihood of it continuing to go down than< than it going up so step number three we than it going up so step number three we want< want further evidence to at least have a want further evidence to at least have a better< better chance that the market can resume better chance that the market can resume its< its Trend right so for example in an its Trend right so for example in an uptrend< uptrend right so in an uptrend we know uptrend right so in an uptrend we know that< that the market general direction is that the market general direction is going< going up then we find a point where it's going up then we find a point where it's oversold< oversold already so we know there's a oversold already so we know there's a little< little bit of Turning Point on top of little bit of Turning Point on top of that< that we also want an additional way at that we also want an additional way at least< least one more way to add the odds in least one more way to add the odds in our< our favor right so this is where you our favor right so this is where you want< want to identify the support for an want to identify the support for an uptrending< uptrending market right so the market is uptrending market right so the market is going< going up and then this time you can see going up and then this time you can see that< that it came down to a point where that it came down to a point where previously< previously price has bounced off right previously price has bounced off right same< same thing down here as well you can see same thing down here as well you can see that< that the price came down somewhere near that the price came down somewhere near this< this support area and then the price this support area and then the price just< just went back up so same thing as well just went back up so same thing as well now< now that it has come to the support and now that it has come to the support and then< then now we see that it's oversold and then now we see that it's oversold and we< we know generally it's in an uptrend we know generally it's in an uptrend then< then the chances of the market actually then the chances of the market actually going< going up will at least be higher than it going up will at least be higher than it to< to continue to go down right same thing to continue to go down right same thing for< for downtrending stocks so down trending for downtrending stocks so down trending stock< stock now we want to look for the stock now we want to look for the resistance< resistance because we're looking for a resistance because we're looking for a place< place whereby the price have some place whereby the price have some difficulty< difficulty going up so as you can see difficulty going up so as you can see down< down here for this example that I've down here for this example that I've showed< showed it's actually gone above the showed it's actually gone above the resistance< resistance and then there is an resistance and then there is an overbought< overbought reading so at this point of overbought reading so at this point of time< time it's also one of the ways that you time it's also one of the ways that you know< know we can probably get into a trade know we can probably get into a trade whereby< whereby we can kind of speculate to the whereby we can kind of speculate to the downside< downside right so remember these are the downside right so remember these are the pairings< pairings uptrend you want to find it to pairings uptrend you want to find it to be< be oversold and then a support and for be oversold and then a support and for downtrend< downtrend you want to find the overboard downtrend you want to find the overboard condition< condition and then the resistance now condition and then the resistance now that< that we have these three steps in place that we have these three steps in place let's< let's get to step number four and that let's get to step number four and that is< is to get into our strategy now this is to get into our strategy now this strategy< strategy there are two parts to it the strategy there are two parts to it the very< very first part is that that we are very first part is that that we are going< going to sell a credit spread so a going to sell a credit spread so a credit< credit spread if you're not familiar credit spread if you're not familiar with< with it already basically it's a very with it already basically it's a very simple< simple strategy whereby you receive simple strategy whereby you receive credit< credit for putting on the trade right so credit for putting on the trade right so as< as you can see down here what we're as you can see down here what we're going< going to do we're going to sell a put going to do we're going to sell a put credit< credit spread for an uptrending stock credit spread for an uptrending stock that< that means the market we know is going that means the market we know is going to< to go up so the put spread is a neutral to go up so the put spread is a neutral the< the bullish strategy that means we the bullish strategy that means we generally< generally want it to go up as long as generally want it to go up as long as it's< it's above the put spread we're going to it's above the put spread we're going to be< be profitable and then we want to make be profitable and then we want to make sure< sure it's oversold right so we found the sure it's oversold right so we found the oversold< oversold condition and then we want to oversold condition and then we want to identify< identify the support which have already identify the support which have already identify< identify it now we want to sell the identify it now we want to sell the credit< credit spread and in this case the put credit spread and in this case the put credit< credit spread below where the support is credit spread below where the support is right< right so in this case you can see I've right so in this case you can see I've already< already placed the put credit spread already placed. the put credit spread below< below the support level so in this case below the support level so in this case we< we have so many things with us right we we have so many things with us right we already< already put so many of the odds in our already put so many of the odds in our favor< favor hopefully that the market will favor hopefully that the market will actually< actually go go up so this by itself actually go go up so this by itself right< right the strategy can already work out right the strategy can already work out pretty< pretty fine but we are going to add an pretty fine but we are going to add an additional< additional part to this strategy and additional part to this strategy and I'll< I'll share with you later on why right I'll share with you later on why right but< but for now you might be wondering Davis but for now you might be wondering Davis what< what is the Delta you're going to put what is the Delta you're going to put and< and what is the DTE you're going to and what is the DTE you're going to choose< choose so this is something that I choose so this is something that I shared< shared quite a number of times in many shared quite a number of times in many of< of my videos but generally if you're of my videos but generally if you're talking< talking about the put spread it really talking about the put spread it really depends< depends on how bullish you are or how depends on how bullish you are or how you< you know afraid you are so so to speak you know afraid you are so so to speak right< right so a lot of people are afraid that right so a lot of people are afraid that the< the market will come down and test their the market will come down and test their put< put spread so if you are very positive put spread so if you are very positive the< the market is going to go up you can go the market is going to go up you can go for< for a higher Delta right what is a for a higher Delta right what is a higher< higher Delta so maybe somewhere around higher Delta so maybe somewhere around 30< 30 Deltas or so and if you're a little 30 Deltas or so and if you're a little bit< bit more defensive you're afraid the bit more defensive you're afraid the market< market will really you know still have market will really you know still have some< some chance to come down you want to put some chance to come down you want to put it< it further away from the market and that it further away from the market and that means< means to be maybe somewhere around 20 means to be maybe somewhere around 20 Del< Del thereabouts right so this is Del thereabouts right so this is something< something you want to play with and also something you want to play with and also depends< depends on what kind of credit and risk depends on what kind of credit and risk reward< reward you actually C comfortable with reward you actually C comfortable with now< now what about for down trending stocks now what about for down trending stocks so< so for down trending stocks then so for down trending stocks then definitely< definitely we do not want to put the put definitely we do not want to put the put spread< spread right because it doesn't make spread right because it doesn't make sense< sense that you're going to put a put sense that you're going to put a put spread< spread down here where you want the spread down here where you want the market< market to go up because it is right now market to go up because it is right now a< a downtrending stock remember this is a downtrending stock remember this is the< the downtrending stock it has already the downtrending stock it has already hit< hit the resistance area where there's a hit the resistance area where there's a likelihood< likelihood it will come down and then it likelihood it will come down and then it is< is overboard so why would you want to is overboard so why would you want to put< put a put credit spread so in this case put a put credit spread so in this case we< we are going to put a call Credit spread we are going to put a call Credit spread so< so generally a call Credit spread is a so generally a call Credit spread is a bearish< bearish strategy where we want the bearish strategy where we want the market< market to go down or at least do not go market to go down or at least do not go above< above our call spread so same thing above our call spread so same thing we're< we're going to sell the call Credit we're going to sell the call Credit spread< spread for this conditions down here so spread for this conditions down here so basically< basically downtrend overboard and we basically downtrend overboard and we have< have a resistance so now that we have have a resistance so now that we have already< already sold the credit spread this by already sold the credit spread this by itself< itself is actually more than fun enough itself is actually more than fun enough in< in many cases right you can trade it in in many cases right you can trade it in this< this way just with a credit spread this way just with a credit spread however< however if you want to play it a little however if you want to play it a little bit< bit more safe right because there are bit more safe right because there are times< times whereby we can sell the C bread times whereby we can sell the C bread and< and the market continues to go up right and the market continues to go up right or< or maybe in the other case if we sell or maybe in the other case if we sell the< the P spread here the market despite all the P spread here the market despite all these< these things in our favor can still keep these things in our favor can still keep going< going down so we want a little bit going down so we want a little bit incentive< incentive for us to still profit as well incentive for us to still profit as well if< if the market just happens to go down if the market just happens to go down right< right so what is this additional thing right so what is this additional thing that< that we're going to add for this that we're going to add for this strategy< strategy and that is to buy a debit strategy and that is to buy a debit spread< spread right we're going to buy a de spread right we're going to buy a de spread< spread by using part of the credit that spread by using part of the credit that we< we receive from the credit spread right we receive from the credit spread right so< so this credit spread is already going so this credit spread is already going to< to give you some premium right so from to give you some premium right so from this< this premium you want to use a part of this premium you want to use a part of it< it to purchase this debit spread so this it to purchase this debit spread so this is< is quite a good way for us to you know is quite a good way for us to you know buy< buy a debit spread using the money buy a debit spread using the money that's< that's already given to us from the that's already given to us from the premium< premium receive from the credit spread premium receive from the credit spread so< so this way you don't really have to pay so this way you don't really have to pay a< a debit outright right so when you a debit outright right so when you construct< construct this properly this should be construct this properly this should be an< an overall credit strategy so for an overall credit strategy so for example< example if you were to sell the put example if you were to sell the put spread< spread down here let's say you receive spread down here let's say you receive $2< $2 for this all right ballpark $2 and $2 for this all right ballpark $2 and then< then with this $2 you're going to use a then with this $2 you're going to use a part< part of it to finance the purchase of part of it to finance the purchase of this< this put spread so how much do you spend this put spread so how much do you spend so< so let's say maybe you spend a dollar so let's say maybe you spend a dollar right< right let's just say a dollar so at the right let's just say a dollar so at the end< end of this whole thing when you end of this whole thing when you tabulate< tabulate them together you're still tabulate them together you're still going< going to get a positive $1 credit right going to get a positive $1 credit right so< so when you put this strategy in this so when you put this strategy in this way< way you notice you have two different way you notice you have two different strategies< strategies going on this is a bearish strategies going on this is a bearish strategy< strategy right that means you want the strategy right that means you want the market< market to come down then you can make market to come down then you can make money< money right for this one this is a money right for this one this is a bullish< bullish strategy right generally right bullish strategy right generally right because< because you want the market to at least because you want the market to at least be< be above the put spread for you to make be above the put spread for you to make money< money so when you have this two combine money so when you have this two combine together< together you have this strategy whereby together you have this strategy whereby you< you actually don't mind if the market you actually don't mind if the market comes< comes down right because if the market comes down right because if the market comes< comes down hey you're going to be in comes down hey you're going to be in profit< profit for this put spread down here and profit for this put spread down here and I'm< I'm going to show you how you're going I'm going to show you how you're going to< to manage this one right but if the to manage this one right but if the market< market actually shoots back up which is market actually shoots back up which is basically< basically what we intend for it to do basically what we intend for it to do then< then here you're still going to get this then here you're still going to get this credit< credit so it's still going to be a credit so it's still going to be a profit< profit so what this does when you put on profit so what this does when you put on this< this put debit spread down here it this put debit spread down here it actually< actually helps your psychology a little actually helps your psychology a little bit< bit more right because let's say for bit more right because let's say for example< example you do not have this put spread example you do not have this put spread and< and you just have the credit spread if and you just have the credit spread if at< at this point if the market comes down a at this point if the market comes down a lot< lot of people is going to panic right lot of people is going to panic right because< because they're going to go oh no the because they're going to go oh no the market< market is going down I don't want it to market is going down I don't want it to go< go down I'm going to lose money and they go down I'm going to lose money and they start< start to panic and start to do all sorts start to panic and start to do all sorts of< of funny things which they shouldn't do of funny things which they shouldn't do right< right but if you have this put spread in right but if you have this put spread in place< place the debit put spread now if the place the debit put spread now if the market< market comes down you're actually going market comes down you're actually going H< H all right I don't mind right because H all right I don't mind right because as< as the market comes down you have a as the market comes down you have a chance< chance to take a profit on this correct chance to take a profit on this correct so< so same thing as with the downtrending so same thing as with the downtrending stocks< stocks so with the downtrending stocks stocks so with the downtrending stocks you< you are going to buy a call spread right you are going to buy a call spread right so< so same thing you're going to use the so same thing you're going to use the credit< credit which you receive from selling credit which you receive from selling this< this call Credit spread down here and this call Credit spread down here and then< then you're going to use a part of it to then you're going to use a part of it to finance< finance the purchase of this call spread finance the purchase of this call spread so< so one thing you will know notice is so one thing you will know notice is that< that all the time the call spread withd that all the time the call spread withd down< down here will generally be be much down here will generally be be much wider< wider than the spread down here which wider than the spread down here which means< means to say it's not going to be an means to say it's not going to be an equal< equal hch of course it won't be an equal equal hch of course it won't be an equal hch< hch right because if this is going to be hch right because if this is going to be equal< equal hch that means the cost of this is equal hch that means the cost of this is going< going to be pretty much more expensive going to be pretty much more expensive than< than this cost spread down here because than this cost spread down here because it's< it's at the money at the money C spreads it's at the money at the money C spreads or< or put spreads are always more expensive or put spreads are always more expensive than< than the out the money counterpart right than the out the money counterpart right so< so in order for us to finance this cost so in order for us to finance this cost call< call spread this call spread down here call spread this call spread down here this< this debit spread we got to purchase it this debit spread we got to purchase it with< with a smaller spread right so it's not with a smaller spread right so it's not going< going to be a full hedge of cost it's going to be a full hedge of cost it's going< going to be some hch at least it helps going to be some hch at least it helps to< to reduce or cushion the loss to the to reduce or cushion the loss to the upside< upside in this case if it goes all the upside in this case if it goes all the way< way up right because we have this call way up right because we have this call debit< debit spread that is going to help us debit spread that is going to help us make< make some profit so definitely at least make some profit so definitely at least better< better than if you just have the call better than if you just have the call spread< spread okay so now I've gone through the spread okay so now I've gone through the Five< Five Steps step number six is to make Five Steps step number six is to make manage< manage the tra

com blueprint all right back to< to the video so how do you manage the to the video so how do you manage the trade< trade so I'm going to share with you the trade so I'm going to share with you the ideal< ideal scenario for how we want this ideal scenario for how we want this trade< trade to actually pan out right so trade to actually pan out right so ideally< ideally we can actually profit in both ideally we can actually profit in both ways< ways that means we want both the put ways that means we want both the put debit< debit spread and the put credit spread debit spread and the put credit spread to< to make money right that is the best we to make money right that is the best we can< can hope for so in this case how do we can hope for so in this case how do we get< get the best scenario The best scenario get the best scenario The best scenario is< is number one the market comes down is number one the market comes down right< right so as you can see once you put on right so as you can see once you put on this< this trade the market comes down so now this trade the market comes down so now when< when it comes down below this put spread when it comes down below this put spread this< this is the put debit spread this put this is the put debit spread this put debit< debit spread will now be in a profit so debit spread will now be in a profit so now< now that it's in a profit you can sell now that it's in a profit you can sell it< it off so you're going to sell it off it off so you're going to sell it off you're< you're going to take uh the profit off you're going to take uh the profit off the< the table so all that's left is just the the table so all that's left is just the put< put credit spread and in this way you put credit spread and in this way you just< just trade it as a put credit spread so just trade it as a put credit spread so if< if then the market goes back up then if then the market goes back up then guess< guess what you are also going to profit guess what you are also going to profit on< on the put credit spread so in this case on the put credit spread so in this case you< you can either leave it to you know you can either leave it to you know expire< expire worthless or just close it expire worthless or just close it whenever< whenever you know you feel comfortable whenever you know you feel comfortable with< with the profit so as you can see with the profit so as you can see this< this is the most ideal scenario now for this is the most ideal scenario now for the< the downtrending stock same thing as the downtrending stock same thing as spell< spell what we want to see is that the spell what we want to see is that the market< market goes up if it goes up above the market goes up if it goes up above the call< call spread this call debit spread call spread this call debit spread you're< you're going to be in a profit sell it you're going to be in a profit sell it off< off you're going to take the profit off off you're going to take the profit off the< the table and you're left with the call the table and you're left with the call spread< spread and then manage as you would and spread and then manage as you would and at< at the same time remember if the market at the same time remember if the market goes< goes up this fill down here is going to goes up this fill down here is going to show< show most likely an even more overboard show most likely an even more overboard reading< reading which at that point of time reading which at that point of time the< the chances of it coming down the chances of it coming down probability< probability wise will at least be probability wise will at least be slightly< slightly greater than it continue to go slightly greater than it continue to go up< up now that is not to say that it won't up now that is not to say that it won't continue< continue going up of course it will but continue going up of course it will but remember< remember we have one thing in our favor remember we have one thing in our favor which< which is that this is a downtrending which is that this is a downtrending stock< stock so the momentum the force is to stock so the momentum the force is to the< the downside so once the market comes the downside so once the market comes down< down after that then you can close out down after that then you can close out your< your C spread or let it expire worthless your C spread or let it expire worthless and< and then you're going to be in a profit and then you're going to be in a profit so< so again this is the best scenario that so again this is the best scenario that we< we can hope for we profit in both ways we can hope for we profit in both ways now< now of course there will be times where now of course there will be times where the< the market will not act in the way that the market will not act in the way that we< we want right the market can just keep we want right the market can just keep going< going up and then go past our call going up and then go past our call spread< spread and the same thing from the spread and the same thing from the downside< downside right it can just go past the downside right it can just go past the put< put spread so there are a few scenarios put spread so there are a few scenarios that< that you really need to understand how that you really need to understand how to< to manage and I'm going to go through to manage and I'm going to go through them< them with you all right so here are the them with you all right so here are the scenarios< scenarios so I'm just going to go scenarios so I'm just going to go through< through just for the uh put spread side through just for the uh put spread side because< because the call side is basically just because the call side is basically just the< the mirror image right so I'm just going the mirror image right so I'm just going to< to explain everything on the put side to explain everything on the put side all< all right so remember for this we are all right so remember for this we are looking< looking at an uptrend stock and then we looking at an uptrend stock and then we want< want to see the overso reading and also want to see the overso reading and also the< the support all right so once you have the support all right so once you have this< this trade on a few scenarios going to this trade on a few scenarios going to happen< happen now the very first scenario is happen now the very first scenario is that< that hey the market goes up so at this that hey the market goes up so at this point< point of time all our analysis is Right point of time all our analysis is Right Market< Market goes up so what do you do right Market goes up so what do you do right at< at this point of time you simply just do at this point of time you simply just do nothing< nothing because it has not gone below nothing because it has not gone below any< any of your put strikes so pretty much any of your put strikes so pretty much there's< there's not much for you to do at all so there's not much for you to do at all so in< in this case just let the options expire in this case just let the options expire and< and you can keep the premium Now and you can keep the premium Now scenario< scenario number two what if the market scenario number two what if the market goes< goes down and then back up so like I goes down and then back up so like I mentioned< mentioned earlier this is the best mentioned earlier this is the best scenario< scenario that we want so how do we scenario that we want so how do we manage< manage this very simple right when the manage this very simple right when the market< market goes below the put debit spread market goes below the put debit spread just< just closing out for a profit now what just closing out for a profit now what kind< kind of profit you looking for this kind of profit you looking for this really< really is up to you right you can take really is up to you right you can take at< at a percentage of the profit so maybe at a percentage of the profit so maybe for< for example you want 25% of the profit for example you want 25% of the profit 50%< 50% or 75% or you want to just close it 50% or 75% or you want to just close it if< if the market goes below this put debit if the market goes below this put debit spread< spread then you close out that's fine as spread then you close out that's fine as well< well right there's no one way to well right there's no one way to actually< actually close this out as long you are actually close this out as long you are in< in a profit then this is where you can in a profit then this is where you can consider< consider taking off the table now the consider taking off the table now the next< next part is where you're left with the next part is where you're left with the put< put credit spread so at this point of put credit spread so at this point of time< time you no longer have the put debit time you no longer have the put debit spread< spread so you just manage the put credit spread so you just manage the put credit spread< spread as it is so there are a few ways spread as it is so there are a few ways that< that you can manage this number one you that you can manage this number one you can< can just let it expire worthless and can just let it expire worthless and then< then you get the full credit on the put then you get the full credit on the put credit< credit spread now number two you close credit spread now number two you close out< out at a desired profit so same thing out at a desired profit so same thing right< right you can have a target of maybe a right you can have a target of maybe a certain< certain percentage of the credit you certain percentage of the credit you receive< receive right so maybe 50% 25% 75% up to receive right so maybe 50% 25% 75% up to you< you again or you could just go very you again or you could just go very mechanically< mechanically basically just get out at mechanically basically just get out at 21< 21 DTE so if you were to just isolate 21 DTE so if you were to just isolate this< this as a put credit spread you'll find this as a put credit spread you'll find that< that in quite a number of my videos that in quite a number of my videos already< already especially when I talk about the already especially when I talk about the credit< credit spreads the tasty trade team have credit spreads the tasty trade team have already< already done quite a lot of a research already done quite a lot of a research where< where I've shown the table that when you where I've shown the table that when you close< close at 21 DT the performance is close at 21 DT the performance is actually< actually pretty good right at least actually pretty good right at least better< better than if you were hold to better than if you were hold to exploration< exploration but I understand that there exploration but I understand that there are< are some people that want to squeeze out are some people that want to squeeze out every< every single bit of profit from the put every single bit of profit from the put spread< spread right so you can definitely leave spread right so you can definitely leave it< it to expiration leave it expire it to expiration leave it expire worthless< worthless if you want to as well right worthless if you want to as well right so< so this is for scenario 2 basically the so this is for scenario 2 basically the best< best scenario that we can hope for now best scenario that we can hope for now scenario< scenario three scenario three is where scenario three scenario three is where the< the market goes down and then goes the market goes down and then goes sideways< sideways so it's very similar to sideways so it's very similar to scenario< scenario number two it's just that it scenario number two it's just that it didn't< didn't go back up now in this case it's didn't go back up now in this case it's actually< actually very good for us as well actually very good for us as well because< because you're still going to be in a because you're still going to be in a profit< profit so what you're going to do is profit so what you're going to do is this< this when the market goes below the put this when the market goes below the put deit< deit spread same thing close out for a deit spread same thing close out for a profit< profit one once you've already closed profit one once you've already closed this< this out for a profit you're left with this out for a profit you're left with the< the credit spread so same thing as you the credit spread so same thing as you would< would manage in scenario number two would manage in scenario number two right< right either let it expire worthless right either let it expire worthless because< because it can just bounce back and because it can just bounce back and forth< forth down here and if it never goes forth down here and if it never goes below< below your put credit spread at below your put credit spread at expiration< expiration you're still going to earn expiration you're still going to earn the< the full credit for which you sold the the full credit for which you sold the put< put credit spread for right so let it put credit spread for right so let it expire< expire worthless now the second one is expire worthless now the second one is to< to close out at a desired profit so if to close out at a desired profit so if the< the market goes sideways remember you the market goes sideways remember you have< have Theta Decay will be working for you have Theta Decay will be working for you in< in this put spread as well so over time in this put spread as well so over time the< the put spread as long as the market the put spread as long as the market does< does not go past the put spread it will does not go past the put spread it will start< start to gradually become in a profit so start to gradually become in a profit so that's< that's when possibly you could get into that's when possibly you could get into a< a 50% 75% so on and so forth take profit a 50% 75% so on and so forth take profit right< right and finally you can just close out right and finally you can just. close out at< at 21 DTE right because if you're at 21 DTE right because if you're worried< worried that past 21 DTE all of a sudden worried that past 21 DTE all of a sudden the< the market shoots down when you could the market shoots down when you could have< have been a profit then you can just have been a profit then you can just close< close at 21 DTE again nothing wrong now close at 21 DTE again nothing wrong now the< the last final scenario so this scenario the last final scenario so this scenario is< is the one that people tend to fear the is the one that people tend to fear the most< most what if the market just go all the most what if the market just go all the way< way down go past your put credit spread way down go past your put credit spread right< right so this is the main reason also right so this is the main reason also why< why I wanted to have this put debit why I wanted to have this put debit spread< spread in place right because if you spread in place right because if you didn't< didn't have this put debit spread and didn't have this put debit spread and the< the market goes all the way down then the market goes all the way down then you're< you're going to experience the full you're going to experience the full brunt< brunt of the uh movement down right brunt of the uh movement down right you're< you're going to experience the kind of you're going to experience the kind of losses< losses that's going to be bigger than if losses that's going to be bigger than if you< you didn't have this put debit spread you didn't have this put debit spread down< down here so this put debit spread is down here so this put debit spread is going< going to soften the blow of the loss as going to soften the blow of the loss as the< the market goes down because you're the market goes down because you're going< going to see the p&amp;l of these two going to see the p&amp;l of these two different< different spreads as it goes down your different spreads as it goes down your put< put debit spread you will see that it's put debit spread you will see that it's going< going to be more and more in a profit going to be more and more in a profit but< but whereas the put credit spread it's but whereas the put credit spread it's going< going to be more and more in a loss so going to be more and more in a loss so if< if you have this two together at least if you have this two together at least this< this put debit spread profit will offset this put debit spread profit will offset a< a little bit of the loss on the put a little bit of the loss on the put credit< credit spread side now of course it credit spread side now of course it won't< won't offset all of it right it would won't offset all of it right it would defeat< defeat the point if it offset all of defeat the point if it offset all of that< that because then there will be no that because then there will be no credit< credit to the upside and you'll probably credit to the upside and you'll probably be< be a loss if the market goes up right so be a loss if the market goes up right so in< in this case at least with the put debit in this case at least with the put debit spread< spread you can still uh have a little spread you can still uh have a little bit< bit of a hch the downside and your loss bit of a hch the downside and your loss is< is not going to be as big as if you just is not going to be as big as if you just had< had the put credit spread so how do you had the put credit spread so how do you manage< manage this so when the market goes manage this so when the market goes below< below the put debit spread same thing below the put debit spread same thing closing< closing out for profit first right uh closing out for profit first right uh lock< lock in that profit from the put debit lock in that profit from the put debit spread< spread now as for the put credit spread spread now as for the put credit spread this< this is where we want to see if it's this is where we want to see if it's more< more than 21 DTE or less than 21 DTE more than 21 DTE or less than 21 DTE right< right so if the market goes way below right so if the market goes way below this< this uh put spread but there's still this uh put spread but there's still more< more than 21 DTE for now you can do more than 21 DTE for now you can do nothing< nothing right because there's always a nothing right because there's always a chance< chance for the market to come back up chance for the market to come back up again< again remember this has already been again remember this has already been quite< quite overs so Market goes down is even quite overs so Market goes down is even more< more overs so also we are on a more overs so also we are on a uptrending< uptrending stock remember there at least uptrending stock remember there at least the< the momentum of it going back up and the momentum of it going back up and then< then we also have the support level then we also have the support level remember< remember below that there'll be more remember below that there'll be more support< support levels as well so hopefully that support levels as well so hopefully that it< it can bounce off one of this and then it can bounce off one of this and then it< it can reverse back up before 21 DT this it can reverse back up before 21 DT this way< way we can also be in a profit in the way we can also be in a profit in the put< put credit spread so if it's more than put credit spread so if it's more than 21< 21 DTE just do nothing however if it's 21 DTE just do nothing however if it's less< less than 21 DTE this is where I would less than 21 DTE this is where I would suggest< suggest to just close out for a loss and suggest to just close out for a loss and for< for two reasons now the first reason is for two reasons now the first reason is because< because we also want to limit our loss because we also want to limit our loss in< in a sense right limit the loss and in a sense right limit the loss and again< again based on tasty trade studies if again based on tasty trade studies if you< you were to close out your put credit you were to close out your put credit spread< spread at 21 DT each time at least over spread at 21 DT each time at least over time< time you're going to have a slightly time you're going to have a slightly better< better return or result compared to if better return or result compared to if you< you hold to expiration and number two you hold to expiration and number two this< this is the more important one this is the more important one especially< especially for beginners because past 21 especially for beginners because past 21 DTE< DTE that means you have less than 21 DTE that means you have less than 21 days< days left to the expiration of this put days left to the expiration of this put spread< spread there is going to be a a higher spread there is going to be a a higher chance< chance of an early assignment on this chance of an early assignment on this short< short put down here so remember this short put down here so remember this short< short putut right now is in the money short putut right now is in the money right< right it's in the money which means to right it's in the money which means to say< say the buyer of that put option can say the buyer of that put option can choose< choose to exercise it if they exercise choose to exercise it if they exercise it< it then you're going to be assigned 100 it then you're going to be assigned 100 shares< shares now even though if you assign 100 shares now even though if you assign 100 shares< shares it doesn't mean that you're going shares it doesn't mean that you're going to< to lose even more than the original to lose even more than the original trade< trade on no you're not going to lose trade on no you're not going to lose more< more than that because you already have more than that because you already have this< this long put down here that actually is this long put down here that actually is sort< sort of limiting all your losses to the sort of limiting all your losses to the downside< downside right so you can lose on this downside right so you can lose on this 100< 100 shares as the market goes down but 100 shares as the market goes down but you< you have the put uh option this long put you have the put uh option this long put option< option as it goes down it's going to option as it goes down it's going to make< make money as well right so you don't make money as well right so you don't have< have to worry about the losses but what have to worry about the losses but what you< you have to worry about is the margin you have to worry about is the margin call< call because once you're long this 100 call because once you're long this 100 shares< shares the broker is going to issue you shares the broker is going to issue you a< a margin call if you don't have enough a margin call if you don't have enough Capital< Capital to actually uh fulfill the Capital to actually uh fulfill the obligations< obligations of buying this 100 shares obligations of buying this 100 shares and< and then from there on what's going to and then from there on what's going to happen< happen it's going to get very messy happen it's going to get very messy right< right if you don't know how to unwind right if you don't know how to unwind this< this whole thing or you get scared this whole thing or you get scared because< because of this then it's best not to because of this then it's best not to get< get into this whole problem in the first get into this whole problem in the first place< place so that is why if there's less place so that is why if there's less than< than 21 DTE close out for a loss now the than 21 DTE close out for a loss now the most< most important thing right now I want to most important thing right now I want to share< share with you is this this strategy share with you is this this strategy itself< itself is not 100% win rate right I have itself is not 100% win rate right I have some< some people that have reached out to me some people that have reached out to me and< and say Davis I put one of your strategy and say Davis I put one of your strategy on< on that you have have uh shared with us on that you have have uh shared with us on< on your YouTube channel and I lost that on your YouTube channel and I lost that trade< trade can you explain to me why did I trade can you explain to me why did I lose< lose this trade guys you need to lose this trade guys you need to understand< understand a strategy whenever you put understand a strategy whenever you put on< on there's always risk right so even if on there's always risk right so even if this< this strategy let's say is an 80% win this strategy let's say is an 80% win rate< rate what does it mean it means that 20% rate what does it mean it means that 20% of< of the time you are going to lose money of the time you are going to lose money and< and you better expect that you're going and you better expect that you're going to< to lose money in some of your trades to lose money in some of your trades that's< that's just how it is right you cannot that's just how it is right you cannot expect< expect that your winning every single expect that your winning every single trade< trade if you expect to win every single trade if you expect to win every single trade< trade then you shouldn't be trading trade then you shouldn't be trading options< options or trading in the first place options or trading in the first place right< right just put your money into t- bills right just put your money into t- bills or< or CDs basically fixed income securities or CDs basically fixed income securities then< then you won't have that problem if you then you won't have that problem if you want< want to get into trading especially want to get into trading especially options< options then you better embrace the fact options then you better embrace the fact that< that you can lose money right lose money that you can lose money right lose money per< per trade but of course overall if you per trade but of course overall if you trade< trade it properly then you're going to trade it properly then you're going to be< be profitable over the long term so be profitable over the long term so remember< remember every time you put on any remember every time you put on any option< option trade there's always a chance option trade there's always a chance you're< you're going to lose who knows you're you're going to lose who knows you're unlucky< unlucky the first few trades you put on unlucky the first few trades you put on is< is going to be a loss doesn't mean the is going to be a loss doesn't mean the strategy< strategy is not going to work right look strategy is not going to work right look at< at the next 100 trades instead of the at the next 100 trades instead of the next< next 10

20 minutes each day< day it should be more than enough right day it should be more than enough right once< once you set everything up then it once you set everything up then it should< should be pretty simple and easy to should be pretty simple and easy to identify< identify this setups so I'm going to identify this setups so I'm going to show< show you how to set things up right so show you how to set things up right so if< if you're new to trading credit spreads if you're new to trading credit spreads definitely< definitely you can use this daily definitely you can use this daily routine< routine as well so this is a trading routine as well so this is a trading view< view chart that I'm showing you right view chart that I'm showing you right now< now if you don't have an account with now if you don't have an account with trading< trading view very simple and easy to set trading view very simple and easy to set it< it up so get that set up first now next it up so get that set up first now next you< you want to find the stocks that you you want to find the stocks that you want< want to trade right so generally you want to trade right so generally you want< want to have a watch list of stocks how want to have a watch list of stocks how many< many stocks you want that really is up many stocks you want that really is up to< to you but if you want to have enough to you but if you want to have enough candidates< candidates for you to trade the Cent candidates for you to trade the Cent spreads< spreads then definitely you want quite a spreads then definitely you want quite a number< number of stocks right I would say maybe number of stocks right I would say maybe around< around 10 20 or even more right this way around 10 20 or even more right this way you< you have a number of stocks to choose you have a number of stocks to choose from< from now as for the stocks I generally from now as for the stocks I generally like< like to find the fundamentally good like to find the fundamentally good stocks< stocks for trading the bput spread right stocks for trading the bput spread right so< so as you know bull put spread is a so as you know bull put spread is a bullish< bullish strategy where we want the bullish strategy where we want the market< market to go up so I'll be trading them market to go up so I'll be trading them mostly< mostly only on the fundamentally good mostly only on the fundamentally good stocks< stocks because if the stock is stocks because if the stock is fundamentally< fundamentally strong that means you know fundamentally strong that means you know at< at least it has been profitable for the at least it has been profitable for the past< past five years then the chances of it past five years then the chances of it going< going to zero is not as high compared to going to zero is not as high compared to companies< companies and stocks that are not profit companies and stocks that are not profit able< able at all so for the buo spread I able at all so for the buo spread I really< really like to trade on fundamentally really like to trade on fundamentally good< good stocks but as for the bare call good stocks but as for the bare call spread< spread then this can be any stock right spread then this can be any stock right it< it can be fundly good stocks or stocks it can be fundly good stocks or stocks that< that have not been profitable as well that have not been profitable as well right< right for example AMC or maybe GameStop right for example AMC or maybe GameStop some< some of those popular meme stocks so some of those popular meme stocks so basically< basically you want to have a watch list basically you want to have a watch list of< of sufficient stocks for you to cycle of sufficient stocks for you to cycle through< through to identify setups now once through to identify setups now once you've< you've got the watch list done the next you've got the watch list done the next thing< thing is how are you going to set up the thing is how are you going to set up the chart< chart so as you can see over here I have chart so as you can see over here I have a< a pretty clean chart and all I have over a pretty clean chart and all I have over here< here is this stochastic oscillator right here is this stochastic oscillator right so< so for this stochastic oscillator uh so for this stochastic oscillator uh what< what I use is this stochastic oscillator what I use is this stochastic oscillator over< over here right let me just open up the over here right let me just open up the settings< settings for you to see so once you go settings for you to see so once you go inside< inside the uh trading view you go to inside the uh trading view you go to indicators< indicators you just type stochastic indicators you just type stochastic right< right and once you type out the right and once you type out the stochastic< stochastic click on that it should stochastic click on that it should populate< populate onto your chart and this is the populate onto your chart and this is the setting< setting that I use right I just use 1033 setting that I use right I just use 1033 and< and you can follow along if you want to and you can follow along if you want to as< as well and as you can see it's pretty as well and as you can see it's pretty simple< simple very clean as well and I removed simple very clean as well and I removed the< the other line so you notice that I only the other line so you notice that I only have< have one line over here so let me show have one line over here so let me show you< you which is the line that I actually uh you which is the line that I actually uh removed< removed it so if you go to style you removed it so if you go to style you notice< notice that for the percentage K I have notice that for the percentage K I have it< it unchecked right I only need this it unchecked right I only need this percentage< percentage D so just remember Davis percentage D so just remember Davis right< right my name Davis just have that on at right my name Davis just have that on at all< all times yeah so the others yeah just all times yeah so the others yeah just leave< leave it as default we don't need the leave it as default we don't need the middle< middle band as well and for the colors middle band as well and for the colors yeah< yeah you you can just change the colors yeah you you can just change the colors to< to whatever you want and leave it to 80 to whatever you want and leave it to 80 and< and 20 yeah so once all this is done and 20 yeah so once all this is done just< just click okay and you have these just click okay and you have these stochastic< stochastic now the other thing is that stochastic now the other thing is that some< some people have asked me Davis do you some people have asked me Davis do you use< use this on intraday do you use this on use this on intraday do you use this on daily< daily weekly monthly I just use it on daily weekly monthly I just use it on daily< daily and it's more than enough right daily and it's more than enough right because< because the way we're going to trade the because the way. we're going to trade the options< options is not where we're going to be options is not where we're going to be day< day trading it right we're not going to day trading it right we're not going to be< be scalping options right this is more be scalping options right this is more slightly< slightly longer time period And as you slightly longer time period And as you guys< guys know if you have been seeing a guys know if you have been seeing a number< number of my videos already I like to go number of my videos already I like to go around< around 45 days because that's where our around 45 days because that's where our Edge< Edge lies now as for the price options I Edge lies now as for the price options I just< just go with candlestick right as you just go with candlestick right as you can< can see there are quite a number of can see there are quite a number of options< options down here I just stick with options down here I just stick with candlestick< candlestick more than enough now with candlestick more than enough now with that< that said we are not going to identify that said we are not going to identify any< any Candlestick patterns none of this any Candlestick patterns none of this shooting< shooting star Morning Star three Crow so shooting star Morning Star three Crow so on< on and so forth right I'm just looking on and so forth right I'm just looking at< at the Candlestick based on the price at the Candlestick based on the price right< right where the market is currently so right where the market is currently so once< once you've already got this set up now once you've already got this set up now this< this is then where we try and identify this is then where we try and identify potential< potential trades so the very first thing potential trades so the very first thing that< that I will look up for right as you that I will look up for right as you guys< guys know if you have seen some of my guys know if you have seen some of my credit< credit spread videos already is that credit spread videos already is that we're< we're just looking for overboard and we're just looking for overboard and oversold< oversold areas first so this is the very oversold areas first so this is the very first< first criteria is it overboard or first criteria is it overboard or oversold< oversold so if it's overbo then this is oversold so if it's overbo then this is going< going to be a potential bare call spread going to be a potential bare call spread setup< setup and if it's oversold then it's setup and if it's oversold then it's going< going to be a potential boo spread setup going to be a potential boo spread setup now< now that we've identified this it's time now that we've identified this it's time to< to just simply cycle through the stock to just simply cycle through the stock so< so as you can see Amazon right now is so as you can see Amazon right now is somewhere< somewhere in the middle it's neither somewhere in the middle it's neither overbought< overbought oversold I'm just going to overbought oversold I'm just going to skip< skip over it then I'm going to the next skip over it then I'm going to the next one< one next one Microsoft now Microsoft is one next one Microsoft now Microsoft is close< close to being overbought so this is close to being overbought so this is something< something I might take a look at right something I might take a look at right maybe< maybe over the next few days if the maybe over the next few days if the market< market continues to go up then this is market continues to go up then this is where< where we can have a potential entry and where we can have a potential entry and as< as you know for back call spread we want as you know for back call spread we want to< to look out for resistance right so to look out for resistance right so resistance< resistance basically is a place where resistance basically is a place where the< the Market has shown to have turned the Market has shown to have turned before< before right over here so this is where before right over here so this is where I'll< I'll be trying to identify possible I'll be trying to identify possible setups< setups so as you can see right now it's setups so as you can see right now it's still< still not above this red line so I'm still not above this red line so I'm going< going to skip Microsoft for now so next going to skip Microsoft for now so next go< go on to next one as well let me just go on to next one as well let me just remove< remove this drawing so as you can see remove this drawing so as you can see Google< Google indicator is showing that it's Google indicator is showing that it's somewhere< somewhere in the middle so I'm going to somewhere in the middle so I'm going to skip< skip that move on as well now for NVIDIA skip that move on as well now for NVIDIA as< as you can see over here it is now as you can see over here it is now overboard< overboard right somewhere around the overboard right somewhere around the overboard< overboard region over here here so we overboard region over here here so we have< have a potential setup right potential have a potential setup right potential doesn't< doesn't mean we are definitely going to doesn't mean we are definitely going to get< get into it so the next thing we need to get into it so the next thing we need to see< see as well is the resistance so as you see as well is the resistance so as you can< can see over here the previous can see over here the previous resistance< resistance is somewhere here and it has resistance is somewhere here and it has already< already broken Above This resistance so already broken Above This resistance so I< I want to see whether there's any other I want to see whether there's any other resistance< resistance above there so I'm just going resistance above there so I'm just going to< to you know Zoom the chart out just to to you know Zoom the chart out just to see< see whether I can see any others and see whether I can see any others and apparently< apparently there isn't so let's go to apparently there isn't so let's go to the< the weekly so we are now at the all-time the weekly so we are now at the all-time high< high so generally at the alltime High high so generally at the alltime High High< High I don't really like to place it High I don't really like to place it just< just yet I would prefer if there was just yet I would prefer if there was another< another resistance above so this way at another resistance above so this way at least< least I know that could be a bounce off least I know that could be a bounce off because< because there could be times right this because there could be times right this could< could be considered a breakout right it could be considered a breakout right it could< could be a breakout whereby the could be a breakout whereby the market< market could break above this and then market could break above this and then find< find some bounce here and then go up find some bounce here and then go up here< here again so for this I'm going to skip here again so for this I'm going to skip over< over this

com blueprint all right< right back to the video okay next let me right back to the video okay next let me take< take a look at meta So Meta right now is take a look at meta So Meta right now is actually< actually oversold so we have a potential actually oversold so we have a potential bull< bull put spread setup so let us take a bull put spread setup so let us take a look< look where is the support So as you can look where is the support So as you can see< see there are a few support areas see there are a few support areas there's< there's one down here there's another there's one down here there's another one< one down here and this one this was one down here and this one this was previous< previous resistance now it's coming down previous resistance now it's coming down onto< onto support So this could be actually a onto support So this could be actually a potential< potential setup so what I'm really potential setup so what I'm really looking< looking to do is that if this Market looking to do is that if this Market does< does come down a little bit I want to does come down a little bit I want to place< place my bull put spread below this place my bull put spread below this support< support and resistance line down here support and resistance line down here right< right so it was previously a resistance right so it was previously a resistance now< now it can act as a support So ideally I now it can act as a support So ideally I want< want to find the strike somewhere below want to find the strike somewhere below here< here right so this will be where my here right so this will be where my short< short putut is and then the long putut short putut is and then the long putut really< really really depends on where you know really really depends on where you know your< your risk is right so it depends on your your risk is right so it depends on your risk< risk portray so let's head on over to risk portray so let's head on over to the< the option chain to take a look and see the option chain to take a look and see whether< whether we can find something that is whether we can find something that is something< something that we want so this price something that we want so this price down< down here you want to take a look at down here you want to take a look at right< right you want to take notice off which right you want to take notice off which is< is around 530 which is where our is around 530 which is where our potential< potential support area going to be I potential support area going to be I want< want to find the short putut that is want to find the short putut that is below< below 530 right basically the short below 530 right basically the short putut< putut strike for the bull put spread so putut strike for the bull put spread so let's< let's h on over to the option chain okay let's h on over to the option chain okay so< so as you can see over here I'm now in so as you can see over here I'm now in the< the option chain so let me just open it the option chain so let me just open it up< up a little bit so as you can see uh 530 up a little bit so as you can see uh 530 is< is here is around 25 Delta and I want is here is around 25 Delta and I want the< the sh putut to be somewhere below so the sh putut to be somewhere below so I'm< I'm taking a look at the Delta right now I'm taking a look at the Delta right now and< and I can see it's about 23 Delta which and I can see it's about 23 Delta which is< is actually pretty decent because is actually pretty decent because ideally< ideally I want my short put Delta to be ideally I want my short put Delta to be around< around 20 to 30 Deltas if you're a around 20 to 30 Deltas if you're a little< little bit more bullish you can go for little bit more bullish you can go for the< the higher Deltas you get more premium the higher Deltas you get more premium as< as well so ideally maybe somewhere as well so ideally maybe somewhere around< around 30 around there would be pretty around 30 around there would be pretty good< good as well so I know that 525 will be good as well so I know that 525 will be a< a very potential short putut strike that a very potential short putut strike that I< I want to choose so I could go with this I want to choose so I could go with this strike< strike but right now it's at 23 Deltas strike but right now it's at 23 Deltas so< so I would like to see the market drop a so I would like to see the market drop a little< little bit more first so maybe once it little bit more first so maybe once it has< has dropped a little bit more and this has dropped a little bit more and this becomes< becomes 30 Delta then you can consider becomes 30 Delta then you can consider putting< putting it on so how do you construct putting it on so how do you construct the< the long putut really depends on your the long putut really depends on your risk< risk P tray if your risk P tray is risk P tray if your risk P tray is around< around 500 bucks then then you want to around 500 bucks then then you want to go< go for the 5 point Y if it's around go for the 5 point Y if it's around 1,000< 1,000 bucks then you go for 10 points y 1,000 bucks then you go for 10 points y now< now if your risk is much smaller than now if your risk is much smaller than that< that let's say around $100 or $200 then that let's say around $100 or $200 then most< most likely you cannot put on this trade most likely you cannot put on this trade right< right because the minimum in terms of right because the minimum in terms of the< the strike interval is $5 right so if the strike interval is $5 right so if it's< it's $5 your risk is going to be under it's $5 your risk is going to be under $500< $500 around $500 so how do you know all $500 around $500 so how do you know all you< you got to do is just go to the chart to you got to do is just go to the chart to see< see in fact you don't have to go to the see in fact you don't have to go to the Chart< Chart just go to the review and you can Chart just go to the review and you can see< see your risk down here is see your risk down here is $364< $364 so if you have anything lower than $364 so if you have anything lower than that< that as your risk per trade then you can that as your risk per trade then you can put< put on this trade yeah so at this point put on this trade yeah so at this point we're< we're not going to enter into the trade we're not going to enter into the trade just< just yet because I would prefer for the just yet because I would prefer for the market< market to go a little bit lower wait for market to go a little bit lower wait for the< the Delta to be a little bit higher and the Delta to be a little bit higher and then< then I. get a little bit more premium on then I get a little bit more premium on the< the trade but if you feel comfortable the trade but if you feel comfortable with< with this you wanted to give it a go you with this you wanted to give it a go you can< can by all means enter into this trade can by all means enter into this trade as< as well now once you've done that the as well now once you've done that the next< next thing you do is just go back to the next thing you do is just go back to the charts< charts right go back to the charts and charts right go back to the charts and look< look out for the next candidate now look out for the next candidate now let's< let's take a look at the next candidate let's take a look at the next candidate it's< it's going to be paler right paler is it's going to be paler right paler is all< all the way going up so most likely you all the way going up so most likely you know< know there's no potential set up next know there's no potential set up next one< one this one also you can see is nowhere one this one also you can see is nowhere near< near the overboard or oversold somewhere near the overboard or oversold somewhere in< in the middle skip to the next one now in the middle skip to the next one now Adobe< Adobe okay so Adobe is oversold right Adobe okay so Adobe is oversold right now< now so Adobe is oversold Market has been now so Adobe is oversold Market has been coming< coming down so same thing we want to coming down so same thing we want to identify< identify the support areas because we identify the support areas because we are< are going to put on the bort spread so are going to put on the bort spread so as< as you can see I've identified the setup as you can see I've identified the setup somewhere< somewhere around here so I think it's somewhere around here so I think it's somewhere< somewhere around 435 thereabouts now if somewhere around 435 thereabouts now if you< you want it to be much more accurate of you want it to be much more accurate of course< course do not use these drawings right course do not use these drawings right these< these drawings is just to uh illustrate these drawings is just to uh illustrate for< for you you want to make it more for you you want to make it more accurate< accurate use the horizontal line and accurate use the horizontal line and then< then put it somewhere around here right then put it somewhere around here right so< so as you can see let me just quickly so as you can see let me just quickly remove< remove the drawing so you are able to remove the drawing so you are able to see< see so it's around 435 right so we want see so it's around 435 right so we want to< to have the short putut strike below to have the short putut strike below there< there so most likely right now the there so most likely right now the market< market brother Adobe is a little bit too market brother Adobe is a little bit too far< far away from where you want to place a far away from where you want to place a short< short strike so chances are that this short strike so chances are that this short< short strike price of below 435 maybe short strike price of below 435 maybe 430< 430 the Delta is going to be a little 430 the Delta is going to be a little bit< bit too low so let us take a look right bit too low so let us take a look right let's< let's head on over the platform again let's head on over the platform again okay< okay so as you can see 430 right now is okay so as you can see 430 right now is around< around 19 Delta so this is a little bit around 19 Delta so this is a little bit too< too low for our liking so we want to too low for our liking so we want to wait< wait for the market to go a little bit wait for the market to go a little bit lower< lower before we start to place the trade lower before we start to place the trade so< so once there's noow trade same thing we so once there's noow trade same thing we go< go out back to the charts again and then go out back to the charts again and then we< we go to the next few underlines right we go to the next few underlines right we< we go to the next stock so over here is we go to the next stock so over here is Tesla< Tesla Tesla is almost overbought but Tesla Tesla is almost overbought but just< just not yet so we skip so as you can just not yet so we skip so as you can see< see it's pretty quick for you to cycle see it's pretty quick for you to cycle through< through as long as it's not overboard or through as long as it's not overboard or oversold< oversold just go to the next one not oversold just go to the next one not overbought< overbought oversold now this is getting overbought oversold now this is getting closer< closer to where the oversold is so closer to where the oversold is so definitely< definitely you will want to pay definitely you will want to pay attention< attention to this over the next few days attention to this over the next few days but< but at this point just skip over PayPal but at this point just skip over PayPal same< same thing as well uh just skip over go same thing as well uh just skip over go to< to see to see close< close close to overso not yet ba not yet close close to overso not yet ba not yet BAC< BAC not yet Disney not yet all right so BAC not yet Disney not yet all right so as< as you can see we have just cycled as you can see we have just cycled through< through the watch list now of course if through the watch list now of course if you< you have many more stocks just add them you have many more stocks just add them and< and just cycle through it so this is a and just cycle through it so this is a very< very simple routine that you can use to very simple routine that you can use to identify< identify possible setups in credit identify possible setups in credit spread< spread so if you are brand new to spread so if you are brand new to options< options trading use this as a way to options trading use this as a way to very< very quickly identify setups to Trade very quickly identify setups to Trade Credit< Credit spreads by the way if you like Credit spreads by the way if you like this< this video then you're absolutely going this video then you're absolutely going to< to love this next video which I have for to love this next video which I have for you< you so go ahead and watch that video you so go ahead and watch that video right< right now also if you haven't already right now also if you haven't already gotten< gotten your free copy of the options gotten your free copy of the options income< income blueprint

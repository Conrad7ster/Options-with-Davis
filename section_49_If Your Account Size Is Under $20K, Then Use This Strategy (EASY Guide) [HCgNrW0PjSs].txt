Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about trading we're going to be talking about trading credit< credit spreads for a small account right credit spreads for a small account right so< so if you have a small account the way so if you have a small account the way you< you want to trade credit spreads is you want to trade credit spreads is going< going to be slightly different from if going to be slightly different from if you're< you're trading a bigger account right so you're trading a bigger account right so for< for small account what I really mean is for small account what I really mean is anything< anything that is under $5,000 so those anything that is under $5,000 so those are< are really smaller size accounts and are really smaller size accounts and this< this is where you need to know how to this is where you need to know how to construct< construct your spread properly and more construct your spread properly and more on< on that later on but first let's talk on that later on but first let's talk about< about selecting the right candidate the about selecting the right candidate the underlying< underlying for you to trade the credit underlying for you to trade the credit spread< spread so we have two types of credit spread so we have two types of credit spreads< spreads as you probably already know so spreads as you probably already know so the< the very first one is the put credit the very first one is the put credit spread< spread right so the put credit spread is spread right so the put credit spread is generally< generally a bullish strategy right generally a bullish strategy right bullish< bullish strategy that means we want the bullish strategy that means we want the market< market to go up now the second one is market to go up now the second one is the< the call Credit spread right so for the the call Credit spread right so for the call< call Credit spread is the opposite to call Credit spread is the opposite to the< the put credit spread where this is more the put credit spread where this is more towards< towards a bearish strategy where towards a bearish strategy where generally< generally we want the market to go down generally we want the market to go down in< in order for the call Credit spread to in order for the call Credit spread to profit< profit now that is not to say that if profit now that is not to say that if the< the market goes down for the bull put the market goes down for the bull put spread< spread or rather the put credit spread spread or rather the put credit spread it's< it's going to lose money right it can be it's going to lose money right it can be profitable< profitable it's just that it really profitable it's just that it really depends< depends on how you construct it and how depends on how you construct it and how far< far it goes down similarly with the call far it goes down similarly with the call Credit< Credit spread the market can actually go Credit spread the market can actually go up< up but as long as it don't go too high up but as long as it don't go too high you< you still can be profitable on your bare you still can be profitable on your bare call< call spread or rather known as the call call spread or rather known as the call Credit< Credit spread so when we are trading Credit spread so when we are trading this< this credit spreads you need to know this credit spreads you need to know which< which is the one you want to use at which is the one you want to use at which< which time so how do we decide which one which time so how do we decide which one should< should we choose and the way that we should we choose and the way that we decide< decide really comes down to trading in decide really comes down to trading in the< the direction of the market right so the direction of the market right so down< down here as you can see this underlying down here as you can see this underlying is< is of Amazon and the time frame that I is of Amazon and the time frame that I like< like to look at is the daily time frame like to look at is the daily time frame right< right because we are not scalping we are right because we are not scalping we are not< not day trading right if you want to do not day trading right if you want to do that< that that won't be four options now I that that won't be four options now I like< like you to tell me based on looking at like you to tell me based on looking at this< this chart down here generally is the this chart down here generally is the market< market going up or is it going down now market going up or is it going down now obviously< obviously it's going up right as you can obviously it's going up right as you can see< see down here the market is forming wave see down here the market is forming wave patterns< patterns that's what you call higher patterns that's what you call higher highs< highs and higher lows the market is highs and higher lows the market is basically< basically progressively going higher basically progressively going higher right< right forming this higher highs and this right forming this higher highs and this higher< higher lows right so if you see in the higher lows right so if you see in the chart< chart higher lows higher highs right so chart higher lows higher highs right so all< all this is signs that the market is all this is signs that the market is going< going up right just from your eyes alone going up right just from your eyes alone you< you can see the market is going up so if you can see the market is going up so if the< the market is generally going up the the market is generally going up the direction< direction is towards the upside should direction is towards the upside should you< you be trading more the call Credit you be trading more the call Credit spread< spread or the put credit spread so spread or the put credit spread so obviously< obviously you want to trade the put obviously you want to trade the put credit< credit spread because the market is credit spread because the market is going< going up you want to trade with the going up you want to trade with the trend< trend now of course there's always the trend now of course there's always the saying< saying of the trend is your friend until saying of the trend is your friend until it< it ends now of course that's possible it ends now of course that's possible but< but for the most part at least you have but for the most part at least you have an< an odd in your favor when you're trading an odd in your favor when you're trading in< in the direction of the trend right as in the direction of the trend right as you< you can see every time it comes down it you can see every time it comes down it goes< goes up again comes down goes up comes goes up again comes down goes up comes down< down goes up again and it goes higher down goes up again and it goes higher each< each time so the put credit spread for each time so the put credit spread for when< when the market is trending up now let's when the market is trending up now let's take< take a look at the next underlying so take a look at the next underlying so this< this next underlying down here Microsoft this next underlying down here Microsoft doesn't< doesn't look like it's going up or going doesn't look like it's going up or going down< down right generally the market down right generally the market direction< direction is up so again we only want to direction is up so again we only want to look< look for put credit spread trade now look for put credit spread trade now same< same thing let's take a look at the next same thing let's take a look at the next underline< underline Google as you can see Google underline Google as you can see Google same< same thing going up so for these three same thing going up so for these three stocks< stocks I'd be more inclined to put on stocks I'd be more inclined to put on the< the put credit spread as opposed to the the put credit spread as opposed to the call< call Credit spread now what about the call Credit spread now what about the next< next stock which is Nike take a look at next stock which is Nike take a look at Nike< Nike down here does it look like it's Nike down here does it look like it's going< going up or it's going down right going up or it's going down right towards< towards the right hand side right towards the right hand side right initially< initially it was going up and then the initially it was going up and then the trend< trend kind of changed and now now it's trend kind of changed and now now it's going< going down so now that I see the latest going down so now that I see the latest current< current price is down here i' be more current price is down here i' be more inclined< inclined to put on the call Credit inclined to put on the call Credit spread< spread now that is not to say I'm going spread now that is not to say I'm going to< to put it on immediately we need to find to put it on immediately we need to find the< the right setup for it now let's take a the right setup for it now let's take a look< look at another one next one is starbu look at another one next one is starbu again< again does it look like the direction is again does it look like the direction is going< going up or down so it's going down so going up or down so it's going down so for< for Starbucks I'll be more inclined to for Starbucks I'll be more inclined to put< put on the call Credit spread now what put on the call Credit spread now what about< about gme right gme has been a new news about gme right gme has been a new news lately< lately you can see that the market seems lately you can see that the market seems to< to be going all over the place right to be going all over the place right like< like this and towards the end right now like this and towards the end right now it's< it's very quiet right it's like almost it's very quiet right it's like almost de< de not sure whether is it going to go up de not sure whether is it going to go up or< or down so in this case is there any or down so in this case is there any clear< clear Direction in the market well clear Direction in the market well there's< there's no clear Direction in the market there's no clear Direction in the market so< so in this case I generally would just so in this case I generally would just stay< stay out of gme now I know there are stay out of gme now I know there are number< number of people that want to speculate number of people that want to speculate on< on gme because thinking hey if this on gme because thinking hey if this roaring< roaring Kitty was to tweet the market is roaring Kitty was to tweet the market is going< going to shoot up they want to play to going to shoot up they want to play to the< the upside that's fine right but for the the upside that's fine right but for the most< most part if you take a look at most part if you take a look at underlying< underlying or stocks like this it's underlying or stocks like this it's going< going nowhere then generally I would going nowhere then generally I would want< want to avoid this because there are want to avoid this because there are other< other better candidates for you to put other better candidates for you to put on< on the credit spreads where the on the credit spreads where the direction< direction of the trend is clearer same direction of the trend is clearer same thing< thing with Chewy down here right you can thing with Chewy down here right you can see< see for the most part earlier on right see for the most part earlier on right you<. you can see the market is kind of going you can see the market is kind of going sideways< sideways now all of a sudden it starts sideways now all of a sudden it starts to< to spike up a very big candle down here to spike up a very big candle down here and< and most likely is because of roaring and most likely is because of roaring Kitty< Kitty he tweeted about it and then the Kitty he tweeted about it and then the market< market shot up so these kind of stocks market shot up so these kind of stocks are< are very highly manipulative so wouldn't are very highly manipulative so wouldn't be< be a good candidate for me in my opinion be a good candidate for me in my opinion to< to put on any credit spread so now that to put on any credit spread so now that we< we know that we want to trade in the we know that we want to trade in the direction< direction of the market what is the next direction of the market what is the next thing< thing that we want to look out for well thing that we want to look out for well the< the next thing we want to look up for is the next thing we want to look up for is for< for overboard and overso condition right for overboard and overso condition right so< so this is something that I talk about so this is something that I talk about quite< quite a bit in a number of my videos so quite a bit in a number of my videos so this< this is if you want to just put on one this is if you want to just put on one trade< trade per underline I think that using trade per underline I think that using this< this over B overso indicator can really this over B overso indicator can really help< help you much better because you can at help you much better because you can at least< least find a point to put on the credit least find a point to put on the credit spreads< spreads where at least the odds is more spreads where at least the odds is more in< in your favor all right so for this uh in your favor all right so for this uh overboard< overboard overso indicator for myself I overboard overso indicator for myself I am< am using this uh stochastic indicator am using this uh stochastic indicator right< right so stochastic indicator is one of right so stochastic indicator is one of them< them there others like RSI and so on and them there others like RSI and so on and so< so forth right so for the stochastic so forth right so for the stochastic indicator< indicator basically what you want to indicator basically what you want to look< look out for is if the line this blue look out for is if the line this blue line< line over here is either going above the line over here is either going above the red< red line or below the red line down here red line or below the red line down here right< right so I'm not sure whether you can right so I'm not sure whether you can see< see let me just try and stretch it out a see let me just try and stretch it out a little< little bit there you go so you can see little bit there you go so you can see the< the uh red line at the bottom so the uh red line at the bottom so anything< anything above this red line at the top anything above this red line at the top down< down here this is overbought and down here this is overbought and anything< anything that's below the red line here anything that's below the red line here that's< that's what's considered oversold so that's what's considered oversold so when< when the market is trending up like this when the market is trending up like this right< right like Amazon you can see it's going right like Amazon you can see it's going progressively< progressively higher should we be progressively higher should we be looking< looking for overbought or oversold looking for overbought or oversold signal< signal for us as a way to enter into the signal for us as a way to enter into the credit< credit spread of course we should be credit spread of course we should be looking< looking for not the overboard but the looking for not the overboard but the overs< overs so right because we want to trade overs so right because we want to trade in< in the direction of the market and the in the direction of the market and the market< market is going up so we want to trade market is going up so we want to trade put< put credit spreads so when the market is put credit spreads so when the market is trending< trending up we're looking for oversold trending up we're looking for oversold signals< signals we're looking at a point whereby signals we're looking at a point whereby the< the market is a little bit exhausted to the market is a little bit exhausted to the< the downside right as you can see down the downside right as you can see down here< here down here when the market came down here down here when the market came down moment< moment arily it's oversold on the moment arily it's oversold on the stochastic< stochastic and then for this one down stochastic and then for this one down here< here as well right Market came down here as well right Market came down momentarily< momentarily and then it's oversold on momentarily and then it's oversold on the< the stochastic same thing here overso in the stochastic same thing here overso in the< the stochastic so when we are looking the stochastic so when we are looking for< for a put credit spread setup we want to for a put credit spread setup we want to look< look at the oversold signal on the look at the oversold signal on the underlying< underlying that is trending up now let's underlying that is trending up now let's take< take a look at Google Google same thing take a look at Google Google same thing as< as well Market training up we're looking as well Market training up we're looking for< for overso points right down here overso for overso points right down here overso as< as you can see down here Market went up as you can see down here Market went up after< after that and another time overs soap after that and another time overs soap right< right overs soap coincides with this uh right overs soap coincides with this uh down< down move here and then the market goes down move here and then the market goes up< up again so same thing what we want to up again so same thing what we want to wait< wait for is for a pullback of Google and wait for is for a pullback of Google and for< for this indicator down here to go below for this indicator down here to go below the< the red line to give us an overso the red line to give us an overso reading< reading now let's take a look at Nike so reading now let's take a look at Nike so Nike< Nike we know that the market is Nike we know that the market is generally< generally trending downwards so if it's generally trending downwards so if it's trending< trending downwards then we want to go trending downwards then we want to go for< for the call Credit spread so call for the call Credit spread so call Credit< Credit spread what we're looking out for Credit spread what we're looking out for we're< we're looking out for overbought signals we're looking out for overbought signals right< right as you can see down here all these right as you can see down here all these are< are overboard signals so overboard are overboard signals so overboard signal< signal and then the market starts to signal and then the market starts to come< come down again overboard and then down come down again overboard and then down here< here overboard and then the market came here overboard and then the market came down< down similarly with Starbucks right as down similarly with Starbucks right as you< you can see Market generally is going you can see Market generally is going down< down we are looking for Overboard right down we are looking for Overboard right overboard< overboard in a few uh cases you can see overboard in a few uh cases you can see down< down down here overboard Market came down down here overboard Market came down< down after that overboard Market came up down after that overboard Market came up a< a bit and then overboard again and then a bit and then overboard again and then finally< finally it came down now the next thing finally it came down now the next thing that< that you might want to look out for as that you might want to look out for as well< well to put the odds even more in your well to put the odds even more in your favor< favor is support and resistance levels favor is support and resistance levels so< so this is where you want to draw lines so this is where you want to draw lines and< and these lines are basically at the and these lines are basically at the previous< previous highs where you see that the previous highs where you see that the prices< prices had some trouble going up above prices had some trouble going up above right< right as you can see down here Market right as you can see down here Market bounced< bounced off this High down here came bounced off this High down here came down< down bounc off this level down here as down bounc off this level down here as well< well as you can see a few times then well as you can see a few times then came< came down and then down here as well and came down and then down here as well and then< then now there's another one down here then now there's another one down here right< right so what you want to do is wait for right so what you want to do is wait for the< the market to trade up first once it the market to trade up first once it trades< trades close to where around the trades close to where around the resistance< resistance level is and you want to take resistance level is and you want to take a< a look at to see whether the stochastic a look at to see whether the stochastic is< is actually showing an overboard reading is actually showing an overboard reading then< then from there you can decide how then from there you can decide how you're< you're going to place the credit spread you're going to place the credit spread so< so let me just remove all this other so let me just remove all this other drawings< drawings down here to make it clearer so drawings down here to make it clearer so let's< let's take a look at this latest price let's take a look at this latest price down< down here on the right hand side so what down here on the right hand side so what we< we want to look out for is for the price we want to look out for is for the price to< to trade up right hopefully below around to trade up right hopefully below around this< this uh resistance level somewhere this uh resistance level somewhere around around around $82< $82 or so and then we want to see that $82 or so and then we want to see that the< the stochastic is having an overbought the stochastic is having an overbought reading< reading at this point of time this is reading at this point of time this is where< where you can choose to enter your where you can choose to enter your credit< credit spreads so your credit spread credit spreads so your credit spread this< this is where you can choose to put your this is where you can choose to put your strike< strike price anywhere above where the strike price anywhere above where the resistance< resistance line is right so at 80 $2 so resistance line is right so at 80 $2 so if< if this is $82 your resistance line then if this is $82 your resistance line then we< we what we're looking out for is we what we're looking out for is anything< anything above that to see what kind of anything above that to see what kind of credit< credit we can get as well right same credit we can get as well right same thing< thing with uh Amazon right let's so thing with uh Amazon right let's so let's< let's go over to Amazon and Amazon right let's go over to Amazon and Amazon right now< now is at around 19 9. 29 so same thing now is at around 19 9.

29 so same thing we< we want to draw possible support areas we want to draw possible support areas right< right support areas like this so these right support areas like this so these are< are a few support areas so what you want are a few support areas so what you want to< to wait for is for the market to trade to wait for is for the market to trade down< down now trade down to a point where by down now trade down to a point where by the< the stochastic is showing an oversold the stochastic is showing an oversold reading< reading and then at a point of time you reading and then at a point of time you want< want to place your put credit spread want to place your put credit spread below< below this support level so if the below this support level so if the support< support level is at 175 or somewhere support level is at 175 or somewhere around< around 168 you want to place below that around 168 you want to place below that right< right you want to see what kind of right you want to see what kind of credit< credit you can get on the option chain credit you can get on the option chain so< so generally if you want to be safe you so generally if you want to be safe you can< can put your put credit spread below all can put your put credit spread below all this< this right now at this point of time of this right now at this point of time of course< course you're not going to get any course you're not going to get any credit< credit because it's so far away right credit because it's so far away right this< this is very far out of the money you this is very far out of the money you want< want to wait for the. Market to go much want to wait for the Market to go much lower< lower and then you look at your option lower and then you look at your option chain< chain and see whether you can construct chain and see whether you can construct one< one that gives you a decent credit okay one that gives you a decent credit okay so< so now that we know what to look up for so now that we know what to look up for to< to enter into a credit spread whether is to enter into a credit spread whether is it< it a put credit spread or a call Credit it a put credit spread or a call Credit spread< spread the next step is to actually spread the next step is to actually construct< construct the credit spread itself so construct the credit spread itself so let's< let's head on over to the option chain let's head on over to the option chain for< for this by the way if you like this for this by the way if you like this video< video so far Please Subscribe and also video so far Please Subscribe and also click< click the thumbs up button and also do click the thumbs up button and also do get< get your free copy of the options in get your free copy of the options in blueprint< blueprint where I share the top three blueprint where I share the top three option< option strategies that help you generate option strategies that help you generate a< a consistent income each month trading a consistent income each month trading just< just one to two hours a day right so if just one to two hours a day right so if you< you want to go ahead to get this copy you want to go ahead to get this copy just< just head on over to options with just head on over to options with davis. com< davis.

com blueprint all right back to davis. com blueprint all right back to the< the video okay so we're in one of my the video okay so we're in one of my trading< trading platforms down here so this is trading platforms down here so this is the< the think of stream web platform so your the think of stream web platform so your option< option change should pretty much look option change should pretty much look the< the same as mine regardless which broker the same as mine regardless which broker you're< you're going for so for this we're going you're going for so for this we're going to< to use the example of paler and as of to use the example of paler and as of this< this recording pen here is almost $28 so this recording pen here is almost $28 so this< this is considered a lower price stock this is considered a lower price stock compared< compared to maybe some of the underlines compared to maybe some of the underlines that< that most people trade for example spy that most people trade for example spy right< right spy right now is over $500 and I right spy right now is over $500 and I want< want to do a comparison between both of want to do a comparison between both of them< them and the reason is because a lot of them and the reason is because a lot of uh< uh beginners when they start trading uh beginners when they start trading credit< credit spreads and if you have a very credit spreads and if you have a very small< small account they tend to go for the small account they tend to go for the spread< spread width that is very small right spread width that is very small right let's< let's say for example if you were the let's say for example if you were the crft< crft a put credit spread right many crft a put credit spread right many people< people may craft one that is $3 wide or people may craft one that is $3 wide or even< even $2 wi or even $1 wide right because even $2 wi or even $1 wide right because they< they think that hey if I put on a put they think that hey if I put on a put credit< credit spread with a small width then my credit spread with a small width then my risk< risk is very small so let's take a look risk is very small so let's take a look at< at the p&amp;l graph down here so you can at the p&amp;l graph down here so you can see< see the p&amp;l graph down here of a $2 wide see the p&amp;l graph down here of a $2 wide credit< credit spread the max risk is basically credit spread the max risk is basically $200< $200 minus of whatever credit you $200 minus of whatever credit you receive< receive so as you can see on the left receive so as you can see on the left hand< hand side down here hand side down here it< it shows that the risk of this trade is it shows that the risk of this trade is $125< $125 right so this is a $2 wide spread $125 right so this is a $2 wide spread so< so most likely the credit is $75 so as so most likely the credit is $75 so as you< you can see there we go the credit is you can see there we go the credit is $75< $75 which means that is the max profit $75 which means that is the max profit so< so this is the reason why a lot of so this is the reason why a lot of beginners< beginners or those with very small beginners or those with very small account< account like to go with very tight account like to go with very tight spread< spread thinking that they risk very spread thinking that they risk very little< little now the problem with this is that little now the problem with this is that if< if you go for a tight spread you need to if you go for a tight spread you need to go< go for the right price underlying right go for the right price underlying right so< so the tstd trade team have actually so the tstd trade team have actually came< came up with a study a very in-depth came up. with a study a very in-depth study< study to compare wide spreads right like study to compare wide spreads right like for< for example $5 wide and $10 wide spread for example $5 wide and $10 wide spread compared< compared to very tight spreads like $1 compared to very tight spreads like $1 or< or $2 right so the strategies they test or $2 right so the strategies they test on< on will be like I in Condor and credit on will be like I in Condor and credit spreads< spreads and what they found out is that spreads and what they found out is that over< over the long term those with very tight over the long term those with very tight spreads< spreads right tight wings as they call spreads right tight wings as they call it< it uh with the iron condor $1 white kind it uh with the iron condor $1 white kind of< of a spread you will find that the of a spread you will find that the results< results the performance is going to be results the performance is going to be much< much worse than if you were to trade The much worse than if you were to trade The Wider< Wider spreads like $5 wide or $10 wide Wider spreads like $5 wide or $10 wide and< and why is this so well the reason is and why is this so well the reason is because< because when you have a wider spread because when you have a wider spread generally< generally your probability of win is generally your probability of win is actually< actually higher right slightly higher at actually higher right slightly higher at the< the same time the market does have to the same time the market does have to move< move quite a bit for you to lose the max move quite a bit for you to lose the max loss< loss right so for example if I were to loss right so for example if I were to compare< compare a $1 wide spread to a $5 wide compare a $1 wide spread to a $5 wide spread< spread so what are the chances of the spread so what are the chances of the market< market going to go past this $25 market going to go past this $25 compared< compared to a fivepoint wide spread so compared to a fivepoint wide spread so the< the fivepoint wide spread let's say for the fivepoint wide spread let's say for example< example let's go for the $21 one so example let's go for the $21 one so we're< we're comparing two right 25 and 26 and we're comparing two right 25 and 26 and 21< 21 and 26 so it's actually harder for 21 and 26 so it's actually harder for the< the market to go past the $21 as opposed the market to go past the $21 as opposed to< to the $25 so that is why the spread is to the $25 so that is why the spread is helping< helping you when you have a wider spread helping you when you have a wider spread so< so many people like to go for $1 wide so many people like to go for $1 wide and< and then they times five of this and then they times five of this contract< contract so they think that they get contract so they think that they get higher< higher premium they do but they don't higher premium they do but they don't realize< realize it's actually easier for the realize it's actually easier for the market< market to give you a Max loss and how do market to give you a Max loss and how do you< you tell what's the probability of you tell what's the probability of getting< getting a Max loss at expiration right getting a Max loss at expiration right let's< let's just talk about expiration and you let's just talk about expiration and you do< do that by pulling up this column down do that by pulling up this column down here< here called the probability of in the here called the probability of in the money< money so if you were to see down here a money so if you were to see down here a $1< $1 WID spread for you to lose the max $1 WID spread for you to lose the max loss< loss at exper loss at exper is< is about 33.

9 7% whereas for a $21 is about 33. 9 7% whereas for a $21 strike< strike the chances of you losing the max strike the chances. of you losing the max loss< loss on this trade is only loss on this trade is only 14.

95%< 14. 95% at expiration as you can see the 14.

95% at expiration as you can see the probability< probability is cut by more than half so probability is cut by more than half so that< that is why with a tighter spread you're that is why with a tighter spread you're actually< actually going to lose more of the time actually going to lose more of the time and< and TC trade actually found that in and TC trade actually found that in their< their studies however the studies their studies however the studies actually< actually show it only on spy and as you actually show it only on spy and as you know< know spy is a very expensive stock right know spy is a very expensive stock right now< now so if you were to put a $2 wide now so if you were to put a $2 wide spread< spread let's just compare $2 wide spread spread let's just compare $2 wide spread on< on a on a $550< $550 underlying right what the chances $550 underlying right what the chances of< of spy actually moving $2 right it's of spy actually moving $2 right it's almost< almost like very quick like in a day or almost like very quick like in a day or so< so it's very possible for it to hit a $2 so it's very possible for it to hit a $2 move< move for you to experience like the move for you to experience like the market< market going fully past your credit market going fully past your credit spread< spread but if you were to talk about a spread but if you were to talk about a $2< $2 spread on a smaller under line like $2 spread on a smaller under line like palena< palena $28 stock what the chances that palena $28 stock what the chances that it< it. can move $2 in a day compared to spy it can move $2 in a day compared to spy right< right the chances are lesser because right the chances are lesser because it's< it's just a smaller price stock so it's just a smaller price stock so here's< here's what I'm trying to get at if you here's what I'm trying to get at if you want< want to put on a very tight spread right want to put on a very tight spread right you< you want to go for $1 white $2 white you want to go for $1 white $2 white then< then it serves you better to put on a then it serves you better to put on a cheaper< cheaper underlying like pent that kind cheaper underlying like pent that kind right< right because you can see so let us just right because you can see so let us just do< do a very quick comparison of palent do a very quick comparison of palent here< here and spy with the same $2 wi spread here and spy with the same $2 wi spread so< so let me just construct a $2 wide so let me just construct a $2 wide spread< spread down here so if you were to see spread down here so if you were to see based< based on this put credit spread down based on this put credit spread down here< here the chances of you actually losing here the chances of you actually losing the< the max loss at expression is 28% all the max loss at expression is 28% all right< right now let's compare it with spy so right now let's compare it with spy so remember< remember we use the 33 Deltas here and remember we use the 33 Deltas here and then< then we're going to. y out okay so we then we're going to.

y out okay so we are< are in Spire right now so for palent are in Spire right now so for palent here< here we use the 46 DTE so we are going here we use the 46 DTE so we are going to< to use the same one down here here and to use the same one down here here and we< we use the 33 Delta to construct our put we use the 33 Delta to construct our put credit< credit spread so we're going to use the credit spread so we're going to use the same< same one down here and we're going to same one down here and we're going to stretch< stretch it $2 wide so as you can see stretch it $2 wide so as you can see down< down here this is $2 wide so now let us down here this is $2 wide so now let us take< take a look at the probability of in the take a look at the probability of in the money< money so if you recall for the pener $2 money so if you recall for the pener $2 wide< wide spread the in the money probability wide spread the in the money probability is< is about 28% to go past the spread fully is about 28% to go past the spread fully but< but for this is 33% right almost 33% so but for this is 33% right almost 33% so you< you can see it's much higher and and you can see it's much higher and and let's< let's take a look as well as the uh p&amp;l let's take a look as well as the uh p&amp;l graph< graph so you can see for this p&amp;l graph graph so you can see for this p&amp;l graph down< down here uh you actually lose more as down here uh you actually lose more. as well< well right mainly also because palen well right mainly also because palen here< here is slightly higher volatility here is slightly higher volatility compared< compared to spy so down here spy 147 to compared to spy so down here spy 147 to make< make $53 so if you're trading a small make $53 so if you're trading a small account< account then I would suggest to avoid account then I would suggest to avoid those< those very high price stocks right you those very high price stocks right you want< want to go for cheaper underlines and if want to go for cheaper underlines and if you< you can go one for under $100 you can go one for under $100 then< then you can go for those $2 WID spread then you can go for those $2 WID spread all< all right so this is how you trade all right so this is how you trade credit< credit spreads with a small account by credit spreads with a small account by the< the way if you like this video then the way if you like this video then you're< you're absolutely going to love this you're absolutely going to love this next< next video which I have for you so go next video which I have for you so go ahead< ahead and watch that video right now ahead and watch that video right now also< also if you haven't already gotten your also if you haven't already gotten your free< free copy of the options income free copy of the options income blueprint< blueprint you can do so just by clicking blueprint you can do so just by clicking this< this link down here on your screen and this link down here on your screen and you'll< you'll be able to get it for free all you'll be able to get it for free all right<

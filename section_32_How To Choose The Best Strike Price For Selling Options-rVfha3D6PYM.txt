=======================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about how to we're going to be talking about how to choose< choose the best strike Price Right the choose the best strike Price Right the best< best strike price that gives you optimal best strike price that gives you optimal profits< profits at the same time gives you a profits at the same time gives you a decently< decently High win rate as well so this decently High win rate as well so this can< can be for a simple strategy such as the can be for a simple strategy such as the cover< cover call or strategies such as the cover call or strategies such as the iron< iron Condor Credit Express and even when iron Condor Credit Express and even when you're< you're choosing strikes for the wheel you're choosing strikes for the wheel strategy< strategy right so before we get into strategy right so before we get into choosing< choosing the best strike price the one choosing the best strike price the one thing< thing that you need to understand is thing that you need to understand is that< that the best strike price can be very that the best strike price can be very subjective< subjective because it can be interpreted subjective because it can be interpreted very< very differently by different people very differently by different people right< right some people think that the best right some people think that the best strike< strike price is to go for the strike strike price is to go for the strike price< price that has the highest premium right price that has the highest premium right but< but the other person might think that but the other person might think that the< the best strike price might be the one the best strike price might be the one that< that goes for the highest win rate so that goes for the highest win rate so what< what you need to understand is that this what you need to understand is that this tool< tool kind of is the opposite of each tool kind of is the opposite of each other< other because if you want to have a other because if you want to have a strike< strike price that has a very high strike price that has a very high premium< premium then chances are that the premium then chances are that the trade-off< trade-off is that you need to give give trade-off is that you need to give give up< up a certain percentage of the win rate up a certain percentage of the win rate on< on the other hand if you want a very on the other hand if you want a very very< very high win rate then you may have to very high win rate then you may have to give< give up some of the premium as well and give up some of the premium as well and the< the other thing to understand is that the other thing to understand is that you< you will never really know the best you will never really know the best strike< strike price until after the market has strike price until after the market has moved< moved so here's what I mean right so moved so here's what I mean right so take< take a look at this chart right now take a look at this chart right now let's< let's say for example if we were to just let's say for example if we were to just put< put on a very simple trade such as the put on a very simple trade such as the shot< shot put and I'm going to give you three shot put and I'm going to give you three strikes< strikes right you're gonna have to strikes right you're gonna have to strike< strike at the hundred dollar strike strike at the hundred dollar strike price< price you have another one at 92 dollars price you have another one at 92 dollars and< and another one at 84 dollars right now and another one at 84 dollars right now obviously< obviously the one at the 100 strike obviously the one at the 100 strike price< price is going to give you the highest price is going to give you the highest amount< amount of Premium so for this let's just amount of Premium so for this let's just give< give three dollar signs right so we know give three dollar signs right so we know that< that this gives the highest premium then that this gives the highest premium then the< the one at 92 dollars gives you roughly the one at 92 dollars gives you roughly you< you know two dollar signs which is you know two dollar signs which is somewhere< somewhere in the middle and 84 dollars somewhere in the middle and 84 dollars gives< gives you the least amount of Premium gives you the least amount of Premium out< out of the three then when we talk in out of the three then when we talk in terms< terms of percentage win rate terms of percentage win rate clearly< clearly the one at eighty four dollars clearly the one at eighty four dollars is< is going to give you the highest is going to give you the highest percentage< percentage win rate so let's give three percentage win rate so let's give three percents< percents down here three percentage sign percents down here three percentage sign down< down here we're gonna have two down here we're gonna have two percent< percent sign and then here we're gonna percent sign and then here we're gonna have< have one percent sign right so when you have one percent sign right so when you take< take a look at these three strikes right take a look at these three strikes right now< now ask yourself which do you think is now ask yourself which do you think is the< the best strike price well the answer is the best strike price well the answer is you'll< you'll never know until the market moves you'll never know until the market moves because< because for example let's say in the because for example let's say in the next< next however many days which we chose next however many days which we chose the< the shot put let's say 30 days if the the shot put let's say 30 days if the market< market was to expire at this price or market was to expire at this price or above< above anywhere above 100 then you're above anywhere above 100 then you're gonna< gonna see that this is definitely the gonna see that this is definitely the best< best strike price because you're gonna best strike price because you're gonna have< have the most premium right you're gonna have the most premium right you're gonna have< have the most money out of this three have the most money out of this three strike< strike prices strike prices but< but what if the market actually went but what if the market actually went down< down what if the market went down down what if the market went down somewhere< somewhere here settled at 96 expiration somewhere here settled at 96 expiration then< then this is going to be the best strike then this is going to be the best strike price< price similarly if the price was to go price similarly if the price was to go all< all the way down to 88 dollars then all the way down to 88 dollars then guess< guess what you're gonna say that 84 will guess what you're gonna say that 84 will be< be the best strike price because you win be the best strike price because you win in< in the other two uh strike prices right in the other two uh strike prices right these< these two other shot puts you're going these two other shot puts you're going to< to lose money and expiration so at the to lose money and expiration so at the end< end of the day you never really know end of the day you never really know what< what the best strike price is until the what the best strike price is until the market< market has moved so how do you determine market has moved so how do you determine the< the strike price like this so in my the strike price like this so in my opinion< opinion the best strike price is the opinion the best strike price is the strike< strike that has actually a good balance strike that has actually a good balance of< of a reasonably high probability of of a reasonably high probability of profit< profit yet it gives you enough premium profit yet it gives you enough premium to< to justify the occasional losses so to justify the occasional losses so whenever< whenever somebody asks the kind of whenever somebody asks the kind of question< question like which is the best strike question like which is the best strike price< price that you know makes me win all the price that you know makes me win all the time< time that I can never lose then the time that I can never lose then the thing< thing is that you need to understand is thing is that you need to understand is you< you will never avoid losses losses is you will never avoid losses losses is just< just all part and parcel of the game you just all part and parcel of the game you may< may have a strike price that gives you a may have a strike price that gives you a 99< 99 win rate but guess what that one 99 win rate but guess what that one percent< percent will be hit during outlier moves percent will be hit during outlier moves like< like for example in 2008 when the market like for example in 2008 when the market crashed< crashed again at 2020 when there's the crashed again at 2020 when there's the pandemic< pandemic crash so you want to avoid pandemic crash so you want to avoid choosing< choosing strike prices based on you know choosing strike prices based on you know having< having the least chance to lose money having the least chance to lose money because< because that's not going to happen so because that's not going to happen so you< you want to have a good balance so in you want to have a good balance so in order< order to find this good balance what is order to find this good balance what is a< a reasonably high probability of profit a reasonably high probability of profit as< as well as what is enough premium well as well as what is enough premium well you< you need to understand two key things you need to understand two key things for< for this so first of all you need to for this so first of all you need to understand< understand Delta right so if you're understand Delta right so if you're familiar< familiar with Delta Delta basically just familiar with Delta Delta basically just measures< measures the rate of change in the measures the rate of change in the option< option pricing based on the underlying option pricing based on the underlying one< one dollar move of the underlying stock one dollar move of the underlying stock right< right so the other way that you can use right so the other way that you can use Delta< Delta is that it is actually a very Delta is that it is actually a very quick< quick way to determine the probability quick way to determine the probability of< of the strike being in. the money so for of the strike being in the money so for example< example if you choose a strike price example if you choose a strike price that< that has 20 Delta that means there's that has 20 Delta that means there's approximately< approximately a 20 chance of being in approximately a 20 chance of being in the< the money which also means there's an the money which also means there's an approximately< approximately 80 chance of being approximately 80 chance of being profitable< profitable in other words 80 win rate so profitable in other words 80 win rate so likewise< likewise for 10 Delta approximately is a likewise for 10 Delta approximately is a 10< 10 chance of being in the money which 10 chance of being in the money which also< also means there's approximately a 90 also means there's approximately a 90 chance< chance of being profitable so as you can chance of being profitable so as you can see< see this is the option chain and down see this is the option chain and down here< here is the Delta right so you can see here is the Delta right so you can see that< that the delta that the delta the< the lower the Delta also indicates the the lower the Delta also indicates the lower< lower the premium but it's higher in lower the premium but it's higher in terms< terms of win rate and on the other hand terms of win rate and on the other hand the< the higher the Delta you get higher the higher the Delta you get higher premiums< premiums but slightly lower win rate premiums but slightly lower win rate compared< compared to the lower Deltas right so compared to the lower Deltas right so the< the other thing that you need to know is the other thing that you need to know is the< the expected move so what's the expected the expected move so what's the expected move< move right I'll talk about this in move right I'll talk about this in detail< detail in another video but for this detail in another video but for this video< video I just make it very brief video I just make it very brief basically< basically it's the amount that a stock basically it's the amount that a stock is< is expected to either go up or down from is expected to either go up or down from its< its current price by a certain time its current price by a certain time based< based on its current level of implied based on its current level of implied volatility< volatility so there is a formula to volatility so there is a formula to calculate< calculate the expected move so generally calculate the expected move so generally if< if you want a very quick way to identify if you want a very quick way to identify what's< what's the expected move of a stock is what's the expected move of a stock is either< either you can choose the 16 Delta either you can choose the 16 Delta strike< strike price on both the puts and costs strike price on both the puts and costs so< so in this case this is the 16 Delta on so in this case this is the 16 Delta on the< the put so that means to say by the put so that means to say by expiration< expiration there is a likely chance that expiration there is a likely chance that the< the price will not exceed this 16 Delta the price will not exceed this 16 Delta strike< strike price right so the other way for strike price right so the other way for you< you to calculate expected move is by you to calculate expected move is by using< using this number down here all right so using this number down here all right so this< this number down here this number down here up< up and down gives you another rough up and down gives you another rough estimation< estimation of where the range will be in estimation of where the range will be in terms< terms of where the stock will be moving terms of where the stock will be moving by< by expiration so there are two ways by expiration so there are two ways either< either by 16 Delta or by using this either by 16 Delta or by using this number< number so for this video just just use number so for this video just just use the< the 16 Delta strike price so why is this the 16 Delta strike price so why is this important< important this is important because important this is important because theoretically< theoretically if you were to take the 16 theoretically if you were to take the 16 Delta< Delta strike price on both sides puts Delta strike price on both sides puts and< and calls the theoretical win rate is 68 and calls the theoretical win rate is 68 but< but historically the win rate is but historically the win rate is actually< actually higher so this is a study that actually higher so this is a study that has< has been done it shows that the actual has been done it shows that the actual occurrences< occurrences that is within this expected occurrences that is within this expected move< move is actually much higher than the move is actually much higher than the theoretical< theoretical number so the theoretical theoretical number so the theoretical number< number is 68 but you actually have a number is 68 but you actually have a much< much higher occurrence within this range much higher occurrence within this range right< right within this expected move so what right within this expected move so what it's< it's trying to say is that if you were it's trying to say is that if you were to< to choose the strike price around this to choose the strike price around this expected< expected move you will have a very expected move you will have a very decent< decent chance of winning most of the decent chance of winning most of the time< time so this is our basis is to identify time so this is our basis is to identify the< the optimum strike price that also gives the optimum strike price that also gives a< a pretty decent premium so therefore if a pretty decent premium so therefore if you< you want to have a consistent income you want to have a consistent income when< when you're selling options and you want when you're selling options and you want your< your strike price to have a lesser your strike price to have a lesser chance< chance of getting breached then you want chance of getting breached then you want to< to choose your strikes around 16 Delta to choose your strikes around 16 Delta which< which is maybe anywhere from 15 to 30 which is maybe anywhere from 15 to 30 Deltas< Deltas right so that means a win rate of Deltas right so that means a win rate of roughly< roughly 85 percent from the 15 Deltas roughly 85 percent from the 15 Deltas all< all the way to 70 win rate on the 30 all the way to 70 win rate on the 30 Delta< Delta so anyway between down here is Delta so anyway between down here is pretty< pretty good enough so if you want to pretty good enough so if you want to choose< choose a covered call so for the call choose a covered call so for the call side< side you want to choose somewhere side you want to choose somewhere between< between 15 to 30 deltas and if you are between 15 to 30 deltas and if you are doing< doing an iron Condor well then the short doing an iron Condor well then the short strikes< strikes will be somewhere from 15 to 30 strikes will be somewhere from 15 to 30 Deltas< Deltas as well Deltas as well now< now what about lesser than 16 Delta well now what about lesser than 16 Delta well if< if you go for like the 10 Delta right if you go for like the 10 Delta right because< because if you go for the 10 Delta then because if you go for the 10 Delta then you're< you're going to have like a 90 win rate you're going to have like a 90 win rate well< well the thing is that if you were to go well the thing is that if you were to go for< for those kind of uh strike prices for those kind of uh strike prices there's< there's way below the 16 Delta the there's way below the 16 Delta the chances< chances are that it may not have chances are that it may not have sufficient< sufficient premium and this is pretty sufficient premium and this is pretty important< important because you need enough important because you need enough premiums< premiums uh to build up enough premium premiums uh to build up enough premium so< so that you can weather the occasional so that you can weather the occasional outlier< outlier loss when it actually happens outlier loss when it actually happens right< right so for example cases are like the right so for example cases are like the pandemic< pandemic crash 2008 even sometimes pandemic crash 2008 even sometimes during< during 2018 well these are the times during 2018 well these are the times whereby< whereby you will suffer and incur some whereby you will suffer and incur some losses< losses and you need to have to build up losses and you need to have to build up enough< enough premium in order for you to enough premium in order for you to cushion< cushion the losses right so if you were cushion the losses right so if you were to< to choose the Delta that is way below 16 to choose the Delta that is way below 16 chances< chances are that the premium which you chances are that the premium which you have< have built up up to that point may not have built up up to that point may not necessarily< necessarily be enough to kind of cushion necessarily be enough to kind of cushion the< the outlier loss when you have incurred the outlier loss when you have incurred it< it right so that is why we want to have it right so that is why we want to have The< The Sweet Spot what around 15 to 30 The Sweet Spot what around 15 to 30 Deltas< Deltas so how do you quickly identify Deltas so how do you quickly identify the< the 16 Delta strike price on the chart the 16 Delta strike price on the chart well< well there is a very quick way by the well there is a very quick way by the way< way if you like this video so far Please

com blueprint or< or right back to the video and the way or right back to the video and the way is< is by using this indicator called the is by using this indicator called the probability< probability of expiring cone right so probability of expiring cone right so this< this is on the think of stream platform this is on the think of stream platform by< by Teddy Ameritrade so if you were to go by Teddy Ameritrade so if you were to go to< to the platform and you pull out the to the platform and you pull out the list< list of indicators you will find it list of indicators you will find it there< there right it's called the probability there right it's called the probability of< of expiring code so basically what it of expiring code so basically what it does< does it it basically grafts this cone on does it it basically grafts this cone on your< your chart so this cone down here your chart so this cone down here basically< basically already indicates where the basically already indicates where the expected< expected move is going to be on both expected move is going to be on both sides< sides based on the time frame right so sides based on the time frame right so for< for example if you have chosen an option for example if you have chosen an option that< that expires let's say the first of. that expires let's say the first of March< March so this is the area which you want March so this is the area which you want to< to look at right at this point so you to look at right at this point so you know< know that at this point roughly around know that at this point roughly around the< the 145 Mark and on the call side on the the 145 Mark and on the call side on the upper< upper side is somewhere around the 160 upper side is somewhere around the 160 mark< mark this is where the expected move is mark this is where the expected move is right< right so this is where you want to use right so this is where you want to use this< this cone to quickly identify you know this cone to quickly identify you know what's< what's the strike price you want to look what's the strike price you want to look for< for when you go to the option chain for when you go to the option chain right< right similarly if you want to look one right similarly if you want to look one for< for somewhere in April then you want to for somewhere in April then you want to look< look for somewhere around here look for somewhere around here somewhere< somewhere down here and on the call side somewhere down here and on the call side somewhere< somewhere near 170. so how do you use somewhere near 170.

so how do you use the< the probability of expiring cone for the the probability of expiring cone for the different< different strategies right so first of different strategies right so first of all< all let's say you want to sell a cover all let's say you want to sell a cover call< call so let's say you want to sell the call so let's say you want to sell the cover< cover call a weekly cover call that will cover call a weekly cover call that will be< be somewhere expiring let's say the be somewhere expiring let's say the first< first of March all right let's just use first of March all right let's just use the< the example of first of March so first the example of first of March so first of< of March basically it will be somewhere of March basically it will be somewhere down< down here right so because we're looking down here right so because we're looking at< at the call side so basically we want to at the call side so basically we want to sell< sell the strike price as one six zero if sell the strike price as one six zero if you're< you're a little bit aggressive right you you're a little bit aggressive right you can< can go for somewhere slightly lower can go for somewhere slightly lower maybe< maybe one five seven one five eight maybe one five seven one five eight anywhere< anywhere within this range right 15 to anywhere within this range right 15 to 30< 30 Deltas is pretty good and let's say 30 Deltas is pretty good and let's say if< if you sell the cover call that is much if you sell the cover call that is much further< further out let's say maybe somewhere in further out let's say maybe somewhere in the< the mid-march then you'll be going for the mid-march then you'll be going for somewhere< somewhere around 165 for your strike somewhere around 165 for your strike price< price so this is a good way for you to price so this is a good way for you to see< see because as well you can actually see because as well you can actually look< look back at the past historic prices to look back at the past historic prices to see< see where there might be a resistance see where there might be a resistance level< level so if you can see down here there level so if you can see down here there is< is pretty much a resistance level is pretty much a resistance level somewhere< somewhere around one five seven so somewhere around one five seven so actually< actually if you want to sell a cover actually if you want to sell a cover call< call 160 is pretty good because it's call 160 is pretty good because it's above< above the resistance level at the same above the resistance level at the same time< time it is around the expected move time it is around the expected move which< which we know through statistics that which we know through statistics that there< there is a very low chance of it there is a very low chance of it actually< actually expiring Above This strike actually expiring Above This strike price< price all right so what about using the price all right so what about using the probability< probability of exploring cone for the probability of exploring cone for the wheel< wheel strategy so if you don't already wheel strategy so if you don't already know< know the real strategy to get into a know the real strategy to get into a trade< trade you always start off with a cash trade you always start off with a cash secure< secure put right so you sell the cash secure put right so you sell the cash check< check output once it expires in the check output once it expires in the money< money you get exercise then you'll be money you get exercise then you'll be assigned< assigned 100 shares so where is the best assigned 100 shares so where is the best place< place for you to choose this strike for place for you to choose this strike for the< the wheel strategy well you may say that the wheel strategy well you may say that you< you know you do not want your cash check you know you do not want your cash check output< output as much as possible to get output as much as possible to get touched< touched or to get exercise well in this touched or to get exercise well in this case< case then you might want to say hey I'm case then you might want to say hey I'm trying< trying to look at the support areas on trying to look at the support areas on the< the chart so you can see there are many the chart so you can see there are many different< different possible support area let's different possible support area let's say< say for example you choose this as the say for example you choose this as the possible< possible support area correct so let's possible support area correct so let's say< say this support area let's say is say this support area let's say is around< around one four one so if it's at 141 around one four one so if it's at 141 then< then guess what you want to find the then guess what you want to find the expiration< expiration strike price that is below expiration strike price that is below this< this so maybe somewhere around one four this so maybe somewhere around one four zero< zero so if you look at one four zero it zero so if you look at one four zero it is< is somewhere around close to mid March is somewhere around close to mid March right< right. so what you want to do is you go right so what you want to do is you go to< to the option chain and you find a to the option chain and you find a strike< strike price in the expiration date strike price in the expiration date that's< that's somewhere around mid-march right that's somewhere around mid-march right so< so if you can find one there then you so if you can find one there then you can< can sell the 140 strike price or another can sell the 140 strike price or another way< way is that maybe you you might be way is that maybe you you might be saying< saying that you know I don't care about saying that you know I don't care about the< the support and resistance right I'm not the support and resistance right I'm not worried< worried about this level I just want to worried about this level I just want to find< find a weekly time frame to sell it I find a weekly time frame to sell it I want< want to choose one then guess what you want to choose one then guess what you can< can just simply just look at this cone can just simply just look at this cone and< and then just identify based on the and then just identify based on the expiration< expiration date so again if let's say expiration date so again if let's say you< you you sell one in a few days out maybe you you sell one in a few days out maybe somewhere< somewhere late February then it will be somewhere late February then it will be somewhere< somewhere around here so it's somewhere somewhere around here so it's somewhere slightly< slightly above 145 then that will be the slightly above 145 then that will be the strike< strike price you use to enter into your strike price you use to enter into your cash< cash secure put then once you get cash secure put then once you get assigned< assigned on on the put similarly you can assigned on on the put similarly you can use< use the cone on the call side as well use the cone on the call side as well now< now what about the probability of now what about the probability of exploring< exploring cone for credit spreads again exploring cone for credit spreads again is< is the same thing so if for the put is the same thing so if for the put spread< spread it will be below or somewhere spread it will be below or somewhere around< around this uh line for the probability around this uh line for the probability of< of exploring cone so let's say for of exploring cone so let's say for example< example much you will be selling one example much you will be selling one here< here and then you can buy back one lower here and then you can buy back one lower for< for the put spread and for the call for the put spread and for the call spread< spread similarly sell one somewhere spread similarly sell one somewhere along< along the line depending on where the along the line depending on where the expression< expression date is and then buy one expression date is and then buy one further< further out and finally what if you're further out and finally what if you're using< using the probability of exploring using the probability of exploring column< column for the iron condo well actually column for the iron condo well actually pretty< pretty much already did it in the last pretty much already did it in the last example< example down here so basically the iron example down here so basically the iron Condor< Condor is just two credit spreads put Condor is just two credit spreads put together< together you have the bull put spread on together you have the bull put spread on this< this side and then you have the bare this side and then you have the bare call< call spread on this side so as you can call spread on this side so as you can see< see the probability of X Prime cone see the probability of X Prime cone pretty< pretty much already give you the idea of pretty much already give you the idea of where< where the expected move is going to be where the expected move is going to be so< so instead of going through to your so instead of going through to your option< option chain you can easily plot this option chain you can easily plot this out< out on your chart using the indicator out on your chart using the indicator and< and then you can go ahead and choose and then you can go ahead and choose your< your strike price on the chart and even your strike price on the chart and even just< just look at the different support and just look at the different support and resistance< resistance levels to complement you know resistance levels to complement you know where< where you want to choose the strike where you want to choose the strike price< price based on this code all right guys price based on this code all right guys so< so I hope you found this video helpful so I hope you found this video helpful if< if you have I appreciate if you give me if you have I appreciate if you give me a< a thumbs up and as well subscribe to my a thumbs up and as well subscribe to my channel< channel so I can create more videos like channel so I can create more videos like this< this for you in the future and as always this for you in the future and as always thank< thank you for watching I appreciate your thank you for watching I appreciate your time<

===================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about the we're going to be talking about the three< three best stocks for trading credit three best stocks for trading credit spreads< spreads and by credit spreads I'm really spreads and by credit spreads I'm really just< just focusing on is the bull put spread just focusing on is the bull put spread for< for this video right so generally when for this video right so generally when it< it comes to trading credit spreads on it comes to trading credit spreads on individual< individual stocks I tend to prefer uh to individual stocks I tend to prefer uh to trade< trade more towards the bullish side trade more towards the bullish side because< because I tend to choose stocks that I because I tend to choose stocks that I think< think that is going to go up in the long think that is going to go up in the long term< term so for this video we're going to be term so for this video we're going to be focusing< focusing on the bull put spread for the focusing on the bull put spread for the credit< credit spread all right so let's get credit spread all right so let's get into< into the very first stock and the very into the very first stock and the very first< first stock that is good for trading the first stock that is good for trading the buo< buo spread and that would be Google so buo spread and that would be Google so Google< Google the ticket symbol is g o g and it Google the ticket symbol is g o g and it is< is a tech stock right so why do I think is a tech stock right so why do I think that< that you know Google is a good stock to that you know Google is a good stock to trade< trade the bull put spread well for a trade the bull put spread well for a number< number of reasons right so the very number of reasons right so the very first< first reason is that it has pretty good first reason is that it has pretty good liquidity< liquidity and has relatively tight bit liquidity and has relatively tight bit andr< andr spread right so as you can see down andr spread right so as you can see down here< here you know the bit andr spread is here you know the bit andr spread is roughly< roughly about you know anywhere from 2 roughly about you know anywhere from 2 cents< cents all the way to about 10 cents cents all the way to about 10 cents right< right and this is I took this picture right and this is I took this picture when< when the market is you know closed but when the market is you know closed but when< when the market is open chances are that when the market is open chances are that the< the B&amp;R spread will be a little bit the B&amp;R spread will be a little bit tighter< tighter so I think this is pretty decent tighter so I think this is pretty decent right< right especially you know Google is right especially you know Google is about< about 100 over dollars so this should be about 100 over dollars so this should be a< a very decently tight BNR spread and a very decently tight BNR spread and there's< there's a lot of liquidity for Google as there's a lot of liquidity for Google as well< well right it's a very widely traded well right it's a very widely traded stock< stock so you should have no problem stock so you should have no problem getting< getting feels pretty quickly now next it getting feels pretty quickly now next it also< also has pretty decently good volatility also has pretty decently good volatility which< which means that you can get decent which means that you can get decent premium< premium as well so as you can see down premium as well so as you can see down here< here it's about 30 plus% right it's not here it's about 30 plus% right it's not that< that too low at the same time it's not that too low at the same time it's not absurdly< absurdly high like some of the stocks absurdly high like some of the stocks like< like GameStops or AMC where they're few like GameStops or AMC where they're few hundred%< hundred% right basically when you have hundred% right basically when you have very< very very high volatility although you very very high volatility although you can< can get you know very good premiums what can get you know very good premiums what it< it also means is that you're going to it also means is that you're going to take< take you know quite a considerable take you know quite a considerable amount< amount of risk because because it just amount of risk because because it just means< means that the market you know is means that the market you know is expecting< expecting that the the underly is going expecting that the the underly is going to< to move a lot right so in this case to move a lot right so in this case Google< Google is about 30 odd per which you can Google is about 30 odd per which you can get< get pretty you know decent premiums to get pretty you know decent premiums to uh< uh get into your credit spreads right uh get into your credit spreads right your< your bull put spread now next it is also your bull put spread now next it is also a< a fundamentally good stock right so a fundamentally good stock right so again< again I like to choose stocks that are again I like to choose stocks that are fundamentally< fundamentally strong so this way I know fundamentally strong so this way I know that< that at least in the long term there's a that at least in the long term there's a higher< higher chance of it going up right and higher chance of it going up right and since< since I'm going to be playing to the since I'm going to be playing to the upside< upside with the bull put spread I upside with the bull put spread I definitely< definitely want to choose a stock that definitely want to choose a stock that in< in the long term is going to go up right in the long term is going to go up right so< so with a fundamentally good stock right so with a fundamentally good stock right how< how you want to Define fundamentally how you want to Define fundamentally good< good stock generally there it can be good stock generally there it can be pretty< pretty subjective let's just put it that pretty subjective let's just put it that way< way right so for me the way that I see way right so for me the way that I see that< that is fundamentally good stock right that is fundamentally good stock right one< one of the criterias that I'm looking one of the criterias that I'm looking out< out for is that you know it must have out for is that you know it must have like< like increasing Revenue as well as you like increasing Revenue as well as you know< know the income so as you can see for know the income so as you can see for this< this Google has been doing pretty well this Google has been doing pretty well even< even during the pandemic right in 2020 even during the pandemic right in 2020 it< it didn't really suffer that much in it didn't really suffer that much in fact< fact I think during the pandemic it did fact I think during the pandemic it did pretty< pretty well right because people are pretty well right because people are starting< starting to go online and a lot of the starting to go online and a lot of the businesses< businesses have shift towards more of an businesses have shift towards more of an online< online presence so you know they have online presence so you know they have many< many businesses that's focused on that many businesses that's focused on that towards< towards the online presence so you can towards the online presence so you can see< see that 2020 2021 2022 Revenue has see that 2020 2021 2022 Revenue has increased< increased net incomes has generally increased net incomes has generally increased< increased over time as well so this is increased over time as well so this is one< one of the basis that I'm looking for one of the basis that I'm looking for when< when it comes to fundamentally good when it comes to fundamentally good stock< stock now of course there are many other stock now of course there are many other aspects< aspects of a fundamentally good stock aspects of a fundamentally good stock but< but that's not the real main point that but that's not the real main point that I< I want to dig into for this video now I want to dig into for this video now next< next it is also still currently slightly next it is also still currently slightly undervalued< undervalued well according to Simply undervalued well according to Simply Wall< Wall Street now there are many different Wall Street now there are many different sites< sites that give the valuation this is sites that give the valuation this is just< just one of the sites so you do want to just one of the sites so you do want to you< you know do your own due diligence but you know do your own due diligence but just< just by following this you can see that just by following this you can see that you< you know the fair value is slightly you know the fair value is slightly above< above where the current price is now as above where the current price is now as of< of this recording so now this is not a of this recording so now this is not a very< very important aspect as to why we want very important aspect as to why we want to< to put on the bull spread but it to put on the bull spread but it certainly< certainly does help right knowing that certainly does help right knowing that you< you know if the valuation is higher than you know if the valuation is higher than where< where the current price is then again where the current price is then again right< right we're just putting another point right we're just putting another point in< in our favor right another way to put in our favor right another way to put the< the odds in our favor so again the odds in our favor so again everything< everything it comes down to probability everything it comes down to probability so< so as much as possible I want to put the so as much as possible I want to put the odds< odds in my favor when I'm choosing the odds in my favor when I'm choosing the stocks< stocks to place you know like bullish stocks to place you know like bullish trades< trades on right like for example the trades on right like for example the bull< bull put spread so how do you enter into bull put spread so how do you enter into a< a bull put spread on Google so there are a bull put spread on Google so there are a< a few steps I'm going to just give you a few steps I'm going to just give you four< four very simple steps to just get four very simple steps to just get started< started and it would be very good for started and it would be very good for you< you as well if you're just you know you as well if you're just you know starting< starting out trading credit spreads as starting out trading credit spreads as well< well it's going to be pretty simple well it's going to be pretty simple right< right so the very first step is to add right so the very first step is to add this< this stochastic oscillator right so the this stochastic oscillator right so the stochastic< stochastic oscillator is basically this stochastic oscillator is basically this one< one that you see down here right some one that you see down here right some people< people like to put on the RSI to me I people like to put on the RSI to me I think< think they're both pretty similar right think they're both pretty similar right basically< basically what it does is that it tracks basically what it does is that it tracks the< the market condition whether is it the market condition whether is it overbought< overbought or is it oversold right so overbought or is it oversold right so anything< anything above the line down here this anything above the line down here this red< red line over here right that is what red line over here right that is what you< you will be considered as overboard you will be considered as overboard right< right OB and anything that goes below right OB and anything that goes below this< this line down here right I will this line down here right I will consider< consider that as oversold so because consider that as oversold so because we're< we're going to place a bullish trade we're going to place a bullish trade well< well we want to put the odds in our well we want to put the odds in our favor< favor as well so we would be better favor as well so we would be better putting< putting on the trade when the indicator putting on the trade when the indicator is< is suggesting that the market is is suggesting that the market is oversold< oversold right so when it's oversold oversold right so when it's oversold then< then there at least is a higher chance then there at least is a higher chance that< that the market is going up now that is that the market is going up now that is not< not to say that the moment it's oversold not to say that the moment it's oversold it's< it's guaranteed that the market goes up it's guaranteed that the market goes up no< no there's no such thing as a guarantee no there's no such thing as a guarantee that< that it will go up based on ators right that it will go up based on ators right again< again it's based on probability and again it's based on probability and there's< there's always a chance that the market there's always a chance that the market can< can become even more oversold after can become even more oversold after getting< getting into the oversold region right getting into the oversold region right but< but what it just does is that when we but what it just does is that when we enter< enter into a trade at oversold it at enter into a trade at oversold it at least< least gives us a better chance a better least gives us a better chance a better probability< probability that the market is going to probability that the market is going to go< go back up from there rather than when go back up from there rather than when we< we place a trade when it's overbought we place a trade when it's overbought right< right imagine if you place a trade a right imagine if you place a trade a bullish< bullish trade when it's overboard right bullish trade when it's overboard right so< so as you can see the overboard will so as you can see the overboard will coincide< coincide with somewhere here so if you p coincide with somewhere here so if you p on< on the bull put spread down there it's on the bull put spread down there it's not< not going to be that strategic compared not going to be that strategic compared to< to if we put it on somewhere down here to if we put it on somewhere down here when< when it's oversold right so that's the when it's oversold right so that's the whole< whole idea of the stochastic oscillator whole idea of the stochastic oscillator now< now if you're wondering what is the now if you're wondering what is the settings< settings that I put for the stochastic settings that I put for the stochastic oscillator< oscillator well I've already created a oscillator well I've already created a video< video on that then you can just go to my video on that then you can just go to my channel< channel and search for the stochastic channel and search for the stochastic oscillator< oscillator I'll share with you my oscillator I'll share with you my settings< settings and how I put it on right so settings and how I put it on. right so you< you can just go to that video and watch you can just go to that video and watch there< there now the second step step number there now the second step step number two< two is to identify the nearest support two is to identify the nearest support level< level right so as you can see down here level right so as you can see down here I've< I've already drawn a line down here I've already drawn a line down here because< because to me this would be the more because to me this would be the more significant< significant support level compared to significant support level compared to this< this one down here right so this one this one down here right so this one down< down here some people can say this down here some people can say this another< another support level so basically another support level so basically support< support levels are places where the support levels are places where the prices< prices have bounced off right so prices have bounced off right so basically< basically this can be a support level basically this can be a support level this< this can be a support level right but this can be a support level right but basically< basically I want to look at the one that basically I want to look at the one that has< has not yet been tested right so in this has not yet been tested right so in this case< case the market right as you can see case the market right as you can see down< down here this could be a support area down here this could be a support area but< but the market has already broke through but the market has already broke through it< it now from here the market has come it now from here the market has come down< down here but it has not tested this down here but it has not tested this level< level just yet so I'll consider this as level just yet so I'll consider this as the< the support level that I'm looking out the support level that I'm looking out for< for right some people might look at 130 for right some people might look at 130 right< right closer to where 130 down here but right closer to where 130 down here but I< I think this is pretty close to the 128 I think this is pretty close to the 128 one< one the one slightly lower so I'll just one the one slightly lower so I'll just go< go for the one that is lower all right go for the one that is lower all right so< so that is Step number two now step so that is Step number two now step number< number three is to wait for the price to number three is to wait for the price to come< come down and for the stochastic come down and for the stochastic oscillator< oscillator to be oversold right so the oscillator to be oversold right so the first< first thing that I'm looking out for first thing that I'm looking out for really< really is for the stochastics to get to really is for the stochastics to get to an< an overso region so from there then I an overso region so from there then I will< will start to look for places to place will start to look for places to place on< on the BP spread so generally when the on the BP spread so generally when the market< market comes down and then the uh market comes down and then the uh indicator< indicator the stochastic oscillator says indicator the stochastic oscillator says it's< it's oversold let's say for example it it's oversold let's say for example it goes< goes to somewhere around 130 then this goes to somewhere around 130 then this is< is where I will start to identify you is where I will start to identify you know< know where I can start to place my bull know where I can start to place my bull put< put spread right because it has yet to put spread right because it has yet to bridge< bridge our support level at one 128 so I bridge our support level at one 128 so I would< would you know use this 128 as a support would you know use this 128 as a support level< level you know as a way for you know in level you know as a way for you know in case< case if the market does come down right case if the market does come down right touches< touches this point there is a chance touches this point there is a chance that< that it could bounce back up so this is that it could bounce back up so this is almost< almost like a a defense area right almost like a a defense area right almost< almost like a a wall because support almost like a a wall because support levels< levels are places where the prices can levels are places where the prices can bounce< bounce off again now of course that is bounce off again now of course that is not< not always going to happen but it's much not always going to happen but it's much better< better than if you were to you know just better than if you were to you know just choose< choose a a level that's arbitrary in the choose a a level that's arbitrary in the case< case whereby let's say for example you case whereby let's say for example you choose< choose 1 3 4 and thinking that's going choose 1 3 4 and thinking that's going to< to be you know place where the price to be you know place where the price might< might bounce off right because we do not might bounce off right because we do not see< see any evidence of the price actually see any evidence of the price actually actually< actually bouncing off here right we actually bouncing off here right we don't< don't really want to use this level so don't really want to use this level so in< in this case I'm using 128 as the level in this case I'm using 128 as the level to< to you know identify where I can place to you know identify where I can place my< my bull put spread so this brings us to my bull put spread so this brings us to our< our next step and that is to place your our next step and that is to place your bull< bull put spread below the support level bull put spread below the support level right< right so as you can see down here right so as you can see down here several< several things have already lined up several things have already lined up right< right so Curr when we are placing the right so Curr when we are placing the buo< buo spread I like to be a little bit buo spread I like to be a little bit more< more contrarian that means when the more contrarian that means when the market< market is coming down then I'm going to market is coming down then I'm going to look< look to place our buo spread because it look to place our buo spread because it also< also helps our strategy because in also helps our strategy because in general< general sense when the market actually general sense when the market actually comes< comes down what happens to the comes down what happens to the volatility< volatility right more often than not it volatility right more often than not it actually< actually goes up now that is not all the actually goes up now that is not all the time< time of course because there are certain time of course because there are certain times< times especially in the recent you know times especially in the recent you know weeks< weeks and some months as well the market weeks and some months as well the market goes< goes down the volatility also goes down goes down the volatility also goes down and< and sometimes the market goes up vola and sometimes the market goes up vola goes< goes up right but most of the time when goes up right but most of the time when the< the market goes down the volatility the market goes down the volatility should< should pick up as well and this would should pick up as well and this would gives< gives us you know a better structure for gives us you know a better structure for our< our bull put spread because for this our bull put spread because for this credit< credit spreads for us to get more credit spreads for us to get more premium< premium we want the volatility generally premium we want the volatility generally to< to be a bit higher so that is why we to be a bit higher so that is why we want< want to enter into such bull spreads want to enter into such bull spreads when< when the market comes down so let's say when the market comes down so let's say for< for example the market has come down for example the market has come down somewhere< somewhere around 130 and just nice the somewhere around 130 and just nice the stochastic< stochastic is saying that's overs soap stochastic is saying that's overs soap well< well this time I'll pull out my option well this time I'll pull out my option chain< chain right I put my option chain and I chain right I put my option chain and I will< will start constructing the bull put will start constructing the bull put spread< spread and I want my short strike right spread and I want my short strike right to< to be below the support area so again to be below the support area so again this< this is like a defense whereby you know this is like a defense whereby you know if< if the market comes down here it could if the market comes down here it could bounce< bounce back up after hitting this bounce back up after hitting this support< support area now as for what Delta to support area now as for what Delta to choose< choose and how wide you should construct choose and how wide you should construct the< the put spread I've actually already the put spread I've actually already created< created several videos on that so one of created several videos on that so one of the< the videos that you can go look out for the videos that you can go look out for would< would be the seven-step credit spread would be the seven-step credit spread trading< trading plan or the $10,000 credit trading plan or the $10,000 credit spread< spread trading plan that I already have spread trading plan that I already have on< on my channel that I've created over on my channel that I've created over there< there I specify you know exactly what is there I specify you know exactly what is the< the Delta that you should enter into and the Delta that you should enter into and also< also what is the width of this put also what is the width of this put spread< spread that you should be entering based spread that you should be entering based on< on you know your account size so I'll on you know your account size so I'll put< put the link at the top right hand put the link at the top right hand corner< corner of this video you can go ahead corner of this video you can go ahead and< and click that if you want to watch that and click that if you want to watch that now< now next what happens if you can't get a now next what happens if you can't get a decent< decent premium at this point of time decent premium at this point of time right< right let's say for example the market right let's say for example the market has< has come down somewhere down here and has come down somewhere down here and maybe< maybe the premium is not that good well maybe the premium is not that good well if< if this is the case then what you want if this is the case then what you want to< to do is just wait for the price to go to do is just wait for the price to go slightly< slightly lower so as it goes slightly slightly lower so as it goes slightly lower< lower then you'll be able to get more lower then you'll be able to get more credit< credit for the same strikes that you credit for the same strikes that you choose< choose right let's say for example you choose right let's say for example you have< have identified 126 as the strike that have identified 126 as the strike that you< you want to choose for so obviously when you want to choose for so obviously when the< the market comes down and the 126 strike the market comes down and the 126 strike becomes< becomes closer to the market that's becomes closer to the market that's where< where you can get slightly more premium where you can get slightly more premium so< so that's what you want to do now what so that's what you want to do now what if< if the price has already gone past the if the price has already gone past the support< support level before the stochastic is support level before the stochastic is overso< overso then in this case you want to use overso then in this case you want to use the< the next support level right let's say the next support level right let's say for< for example if the market reaches around for example if the market reaches around 125< 125 then your stochastic becomes 125 then your stochastic becomes oversold< oversold then in this case you notice oversold then in this case you notice that< that it has already breached this that it has already breached this support< support level at 128 well in this case support level at 128 well in this case just< just go for the next one right so the just go for the next one right so the next< next one as you can see I've identified next one as you can see I've identified down< down here which is roughly around 120 down here which is roughly around 120 then< then from here you can take a look at then from here you can take a look at the< the option chain again and then the option chain again and then construct< construct a boo spread where your short construct a boo spread where your short strike< strike the short put is below this 120 strike the short put is below this 120 support< support level right so maybe you can go support level right so maybe you can go for< for something like 115 or 118 whatever for something like 115 or 118 whatever you< you can get at the point of time when you can get at the point of time when you< you take a look at option chain and same you take a look at option chain and same thing< thing again let's say for example you're thing again let's say for example you're not< not able to get you know a good enough not able to get you know a good enough credit< credit when it comes to you know credit when it comes to you know constructing< constructing your buut spread right so constructing your buut spread right so what< what you can do is wait for the market what you can do is wait for the market to< to go a little bit lower then you take a to go a little bit lower then you take a look< look at those strikes again and see look at those strikes again and see whether< whether you can get the you know desired whether you can get the you know desired premium< premium that you want by the way if you premium that you want by the way if you like< like this video so far

com blueprint all right< right back to the video now the next right back to the video now the next stock< stock that I think is good for trading stock that I think is good for trading you< you know credit spreads like the bullo you know credit spreads like the bullo spread< spread and that would be meta right meta spread and that would be meta right meta basically< basically is Facebook right So Meta the basically is Facebook right So Meta the ticket< ticket symbol is Mea it's also Al a tech ticket symbol is Mea it's also Al a tech stock< stock so again why is this a good stock stock so again why is this a good stock to< to trade the buut spread so similarly it to trade the buut spread so similarly it has< has pretty good liquidity and relatively has pretty good liquidity and relatively tight< tight bid andr spread right so uh meta tight bid andr spread right so uh meta is< is much more expensive than Google so is much more expensive than Google so obviously< obviously you will tend to see the Bida obviously you will tend to see the Bida spread< spread slightly wider than for Google spread slightly wider than for Google but< but in terms of the percentage in terms but in terms of the percentage in terms of< of the width or rather the spread of the width or rather. the spread between< between the B actually pretty decent between the B actually pretty decent right< right as you can see it's about 20 cents right as you can see it's about 20 cents wide< wide at the money around here right the wide at the money around here right the was< was 345 strike about 20 cents 350 is was 345 strike about 20 cents 350 is about< about 20 cents and this is about $300 about 20 cents and this is about $300 odd< odd stock so I think it's perfectly fine odd stock so I think it's perfectly fine for< for you to get into it and again you for you to get into it and again you know< know meta is a very high liquidity stock know meta is a very high liquidity stock right< right A lot of people are trading this right A lot of people are trading this stocks< stocks as well now next meta has pretty stocks as well now next meta has pretty good< good volatility which means you can get good volatility which means you can get good< good premium so as you can see down here good premium so as you can see down here the< the the volatility is much higher than the the volatility is much higher than Google< Google Google is averaging about 30% now Google Google is averaging about 30% now for< for meta you get about 40 odd per. right for meta you get about 40 odd per.

right so< so for 40 plus% you can definitely get a so for 40 plus% you can definitely get a much< much better premium which means to say much better premium which means to say you< you know you could get a better you know you could get a better structure< structure compared to if you were to structure compared to if you were to trade< trade it when there's lower volatility trade it when there's lower volatility now< now next in my opinion meta is also a now next in my opinion meta is also a fundamentally< fundamentally good stock so as you can fundamentally good stock so as you can see< see for the most part right the revenue see for the most part right the revenue is< is generally increasing your net income is generally increasing your net income is< is also increasing although in 2022 is also increasing although in 2022 right< right it was affected a little bit but I right it was affected a little bit but I still< still think that meta overall is still a still think that meta overall is still a fundamentally< fundamentally good stock and I do think fundamentally good stock and I do think that< that over the long term it's still going that over the long term it's still going to< to go up so again this would be a very to go up so again this would be a very good< good candidate for us to trade the good candidate for us to trade the bullish< bullish side right so in this case the bullish side right so in this case the bull< bull put spread and it is also still bull put spread and it is also still undervalue< undervalue again according to Simply undervalue again according to Simply Wall< Wall Street now again you want to do Wall Street now again you want to do your< your own due diligence to find you know your own due diligence to find you know the< the site where you're most comfortable the site where you're most comfortable with< with with the valuation so for me I just with with the valuation so for me I just take< take simply Wall Street right again to take simply Wall Street right again to me< me this is not very very important but me this is not very very important but at< at least it's nice to know that you know at least it's nice to know that you know the< the fair value is above where the the fair value is above where the current< current price is which means to say current price is which means to say there< there should be some room for the market there should be some room for the market Market< Market to still keep going up so that is Market to still keep going up so that is why< why again we want to play to the long why again we want to play to the long side< side all right so how do you enter into side all right so how do you enter into a< a bullo spread or meta so again same a bullo spread or meta so again same thing< thing right step number one we add the thing right step number one we add the stochastic< stochastic oscillator step number two stochastic oscillator step number two identify< identify the nearest support level so as identify the nearest support level so as you< you can see I've identified somewhere you can see I've identified somewhere around< around 315 which is where you know there around 315 which is where you know there was< was this last bounce now step number was this last bounce now step number three< three same thing wait for the price to three same thing wait for the price to come< come down and for the stochastic come down and for the stochastic oscillator< oscillator to be overs Soo right once I oscillator to be overs Soo right once I see< see it's overs Soo then the next thing see it's overs Soo then the next thing I'll< I'll do I will go over to the option I'll do I will go over to the option chain< chain and then start to identify the chain and then start to identify the strikes< strikes that I want to choose so again I strikes that I want to choose so again I want< want to place my bull put spread below want to place my bull put spread below the< the support level so this gives me an the support level so this gives me an increased< increased chance or a higher probability increased chance or a higher probability that< that the market is going to go up rather that the market is going to go up rather than< than it continue going down so as you than it continue going down so as you can< can see we've got a few things going you can see we've got a few things going you know< know in our way right firstly we've know in our way right firstly we've identified< identified the support level next we identified the support level next we have< have the stochastic oscillator being have the stochastic oscillator being oversold< oversold and at the same time you know oversold and at the same time you know we< we have a contrarian approach that means we have a contrarian approach that means the< the market has already gone down right the market has already gone down right right< right so if the market has already gone right so if the market has already gone down< down at least to say that there's down at least to say that there's probably< probably a better chance of it you know probably a better chance of it you know going< going up than it immediately going one going up than it immediately going one straight< straight line down although that can be straight line down although that can be possible< possible if there's some big news that's possible if there's some big news that's going< going to come on but for the most part going to come on but for the most part we< we have most of the probability lined up we have most of the probability lined up in< in our favor and we just want to go with in our favor and we just want to go with the< the odds right so we know that at least the odds right so we know that at least in< in the long term we have winners and in the long term we have winners and losers< losers but overall the winners are going losers but overall the winners are going to< to outpace the losers and we're going to to outpace the losers and we're going to become< become net profitable now what if you become net profitable now what if you can< can get a decent premium then same thing can get a decent premium then same thing again< again just wait for the price to go again just wait for the price to go lower< lower and then you enter into the bull lower and then you enter into the bull put< put spread right so you don't have to put spread right so you don't have to force< force a bull put spread at any time the force a bull put spread at any time the moment< moment you see this is overs so right moment you see this is overs so right you< you also have to wait until the you also have to wait until the conditions< conditions are right for you to get you conditions are right for you to get you know< know at least a decent premium next what know at least a decent premium next what if< if the price has already gone past the if the price has already gone past the support< support level before the stochastics is support level before the stochastics is oversold< oversold then again use the next support oversold then again use the next support level< level so for example maybe the price has level so for example maybe the price has gone< gone down to 300 before you see the gone down to 300 before you see the oversold< oversold signal then in this case you oversold signal then in this case you can< can use the next level right 275 and can use the next level right 275 and chances< chances are let's say for example if the chances are let's say for example if the price< price really is at price really is at $300< $300 then you might have to wait for the $300 then you might have to wait for the price< price to go further down before you're price to go further down before you're able< able to get some decent premium to put able to get some decent premium to put on< on this bullo spread that is below this on this bullo spread that is below this next< next support level at 275 now let's go next support level at 275 now let's go to< to the last and final one the third one to the last and final one the third one and< and that is the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF the and that is the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF the ticket< ticket simple is spy now spy is not ticket simple is spy now spy is not exactly< exactly a stock per se not an individual exactly a stock per se not an individual stock< stock but it's a buy basket of stocks stock but it's a buy basket of stocks right< right so the Spy is a broad-based index right so the Spy is a broad-based index ETF< ETF so why do I think that the Spy is ETF so why do I think that the Spy is good< good to trade the bull put spread well good to trade the bull put spread well first< first of all the spy the index ETF has a first of all the spy the index ETF has a positive< positive drift right so this positive positive drift right so this positive drift< drift is a very very important thing you drift is a very very important thing you want< want to understand because over the long want to understand because over the long term< term the market just wants to go higher term the market just wants to go higher as< as the companies get more profitable the as the companies get more profitable the stocks< stocks gets more and more expensive so stocks gets more and more expensive so as< as you can see if you go all the way as you can see if you go all the way back< back to a decade ago or even more more back to a decade ago or even more more than< than that you'll notice that the index than that you'll notice that the index ETF< ETF has just gone higher and higher each ETF has just gone higher and higher each time< time right that is not to say that the time right that is not to say that the market< market won't go you know down in the market won't go you know down in the short< short intermediary term but over the short intermediary term but over the long< long term the next 10 20 years the long term the next 10 20 years the market< market is going to go up again so market is going to go up again so generally< generally there is a bullish bias in generally there is a bullish bias in this< this index ETF right so that is why this index ETF right so that is why again< again since it has a bullish bias I want again since it has a bullish bias I want to< to go more towards the bullish side so to go more towards the bullish side so again< again I'm putting the odds in my favor again I'm putting the odds in my favor and< and also the index ETFs is much less and also the index ETFs is much less volatile< volatile than individual stocks which volatile than individual stocks which means< means it's less risky so as you can see means it's less risky so as you can see in< in this graph down here they compare the in this graph down here they compare the ETS< ETS versus stock so this is a study done ETS versus stock so this is a study done by< by tasty trade team the research team by tasty trade team the research team they< they have studied this and they have they have studied this and they have noticed< noticed that you know based on their noticed that you know based on their their< their results the studies ETFs tend to their results the studies ETFs tend to stand< stand stay in a narrower range compared stand stay in a narrower range compared to< to stocks right so stocks can have a to stocks right so stocks can have a very< very wide swing so when we are trading very wide swing so when we are trading this< this uh bull put spread the credit this uh bull put spread the credit spreads< spreads basically any short option spreads basically any short option strategies< strategies we do not want the underlying strategies we do not want the underlying to< to move that much against us that is why to move that much against us that is why when< when you trade the index ETFs is when you trade the index ETFs is generally< generally going to be much safer than generally going to be much safer than trading< trading individual stocks now more trading individual stocks now more importantly< importantly why I think that spy is a importantly why I think that spy is a really< really really good underlying for us to really really good underlying for us to trade< trade the Poo spread is because the trade the Poo spread is because the extensive< extensive Studies have already shown extensive Studies have already shown that< that the booo spread is profitable over that the booo spread is profitable over the< the long term so as you can see this is the long term so as you can see this is a< a study again done by the tasty trade a study again done by the tasty trade. team< team what they did in this study is that team what they did in this study is that they< they just put on the bull put spread they just put on the bull put spread over< over and over again right you can see over and over again right you can see that< that they compare two different uh that they compare two different uh management< management right one of them is to hold management right one of them is to hold it< it to expiration the other one is to get it to expiration the other one is to get out< out at 21 DTE that means once there's 21 out at 21 DTE that means once there's 21 days< days left to expiration they just close days left to expiration they just close the< the trade and put on a new one so as you the trade and put on a new one so as you can< can see both of them are actually can see both of them are actually profitable< profitable and this study have you know profitable and this study have you know spend< spend across for the past decade or so spend across for the past decade or so and< and it makes sense right because if you and it makes sense right because if you were< were to put on The Bu spread you know on were to put on The Bu spread you know on the< the index ETF where it just keeps going the index ETF where it just keeps going higher< higher at the end you're going to become higher at the end you're going to become net< net profitable right so that is why the net profitable right so that is why the buo< buo spread is very good strategy for us buo spread is very good strategy for us to< to use on spy all right so how do you to use on spy all right so how do you enter< enter into the bull boot spread on spy enter into the bull boot spread on spy so< so same thing we bring up our four steps so same thing we bring up our four steps so< so the very first step again we want to so the very first step again we want to add< add the stochastic oscillator now step add the stochastic oscillator now step number< number two is to identify the nearest number two is to identify the nearest support< support level now for the Spy what you support level now for the Spy what you notice< notice is that there's no real clear notice is that there's no real clear clean< clean cut support level compared to you clean cut support level compared to you know< know when we were taking a look at you know when we were taking a look at you know< know meta as well as Google because know meta as well as Google because there's< there's a place in time where the market there's a place in time where the market did< did you know bounce down and go back up did you know bounce down and go back up again< again and we could identify this as the again and we could identify this as the support< support level but for spy you notice support level but for spy you notice that< that there really isn't this very clear that there really isn't this very clear or< or clean cut price movement down the or clean cut price movement down the retracement< retracement where we can identify a retracement where we can identify a support< support level so what I've uh chosen as support level so what I've uh chosen as the< the support level is basically the the support level is basically the previous< previous resistance level so as you can previous resistance level so as you can see< see down here the prices has bounced off see down here the prices has bounced off here< here so normally when the prices you here so normally when the prices you know< know have broken up the resistance that know have broken up the resistance that could< could be a good place where it becomes a could be a good place where it becomes a support< support level again right that means the support level again right that means the market< market could come back down here and market could come back down here and then< then because it has been a resistance then because it has been a resistance level< level before there's a chance that the level before there's a chance that the market< market could bounce back up again at the market could bounce back up again at the same< same time you can see there's some same time you can see there's some consolidation< consolidation down here where it keep consolidation down here where it keep testing< testing this you know level down here testing this you know level down here around< around 453 and then it just went up from around 453 and then it just went up from there< there right so we could use this as a there right so we could use this as a support< support level now if you're a little bit support level now if you're a little bit more< more conservative then you might want to more conservative then you might want to use< use the next one right so the next one use the next one right so the next one will< will be somewhere down here around will be somewhere down here around 437< 437 438 right as you can see down here 437 438 right as you can see down here the< the price over here has kind of the price over here has kind of Consolidated< Consolidated for quite a bit before you Consolidated for quite a bit before you know< know it went down and then broke up know it went down and then broke up again< again so what might happen is that the again so what might happen is that the price< price could come down here and then find price could come down here and then find this< this as a support and then go back up this as a support and then go back up again< again so again it really depends on how again so again it really depends on how you< you want to see it if you're a little you want to see it if you're a little bit< bit more aggressive you want to get into bit more aggressive you want to get into a< a trade you know soon enough then you a trade you know soon enough then you might< might want to go for this one down here might want to go for this one down here as< as the support level if you're a little as the support level if you're a little bit< bit more conservative you want to trade bit more conservative you want to trade to< to work out a little bit you know at to work out a little bit you know at least< least have a higher chance of the trade least have a higher chance of the trade working< working out then you might want to working out then you might want to consider< consider the lower support level all consider the lower support level all right< right so that is for step number two now right so that is for step number two now step< step number three wait for the price to step number three wait for the price to come< come down and for the stochastic come down and for the stochastic oscillator< oscillator to be oversold so again same oscillator to be oversold so again same thing< thing if you're choosing the one you thing if you're choosing the one you know< know that's slightly higher then you know that's slightly higher then you might< might want to wait for the price to come might want to wait for the price to come down< down here and take a look is it already down here and take a look is it already oversold< oversold if it is oversold then you can oversold if it is oversold then you can start< start to look at option chain and then start to look at option chain and then you< you know get into your B spread again you know get into your B spread again you< you want your bu spread to be below the you want your bu spread to be below the support< support line but let's say for example support line but let's say for example at< at this point when it goes to 4 at this point when it goes to 4 60< 60 you'll notice that it's still not 60 you'll notice that it's still not overso< overso right let's say for example this overso right let's say for example this is< is not overso yet and even though if it is not overso yet and even though if it comes< comes down here to this support level is comes down here to this support level is still< still not oversold then you want to use still not oversold then you want to use the< the next one right so the next one same the next one right so the next one same thing< thing you wait for the price to come thing you wait for the price to come down< down a little bit lower so let's say at down a little bit lower so let's say at this< this point around 444 you see that hey this point around 444 you see that hey it's< it's already oversold then you start to it's already oversold then you start to place< place your bull put spread so this is place your bull put spread so this is where< where you go to your option chain same where you go to your option chain same thing< thing as how we normally do go and find thing as how we normally do go and find the< the strike prices that you want that is the strike prices that you want that is below< below the support levels that you have below the support levels that you have already< already identified let's see whether you already identified let's see whether you can< can get you know enough premium for that can get you know enough premium for that if< if you can't get enough premium wait for if you can't get enough premium wait for the< the prices to go a little bit lower so the prices to go a little bit lower so again< again this is for the slightly more again this is for the slightly more aggressive< aggressive support level and this is for aggressive support level and this is for the< the more conservative support level now the more conservative support level now if< if you can't get a decent premium like I if you can't get a decent premium like I mentioned< mentioned just wait for the price to go mentioned just wait for the price to go a< a little bit lower before entering to a little bit lower before entering to the< the bupo spread and if the price has the bupo spread and if the price has already< already gone past the support level already gone past the support level before< before the stochastic is oversold then before the stochastic is oversold then use< use the next level so in this case let's use the next level so in this case let's say< say if the market has gone all the way say if the market has gone all the way to< to 432 before you see overs soap which to 432 before you see overs soap which is< is highly unlikely because chances are is highly unlikely because chances are since< since the market has already dropped since the market has already dropped quite< quite a bit it should be oversold by quite a bit it should be oversold by this< this point but let's say for example this point but let's say for example it's< it's not oversold then the next support it's not oversold then the next support level< level would be somewhere around here so level would be somewhere around here so as< as you can see guys this is very four as you can see guys this is very four simple< simple steps that you can use right step simple steps that you can use right step number< number one use the stochastic oscillator number one use the stochastic oscillator or< or RSI if you feel more comfortable with or RSI if you feel more comfortable with that< that identify the nearest support level that identify the nearest support level wait< wait for the price to come down and for wait for the price to come down and for the< the St oscillator to be oversold then the St oscillator to be oversold then you< you take a look at your option chain and you take a look at your option chain and find< find the buo spread strike price that's find the buo spread strike price that's below< below the support levels all right guys below the support levels all right guys so< so these are the three best stocks that so these are the three best stocks that are< are great for trading credit spreads are great for trading credit spreads more< more specifically the booot spread by more specifically the booot spread by the< the way if you like this video then the way if you like this video then you're< you're

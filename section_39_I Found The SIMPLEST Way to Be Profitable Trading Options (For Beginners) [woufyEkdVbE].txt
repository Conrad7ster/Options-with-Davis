video is reason I wanted to create this video is because< because not too long ago I've actually because not too long ago I've actually compiled< compiled a survey result which I've been compiled a survey result which I've been doing< doing on my audience just to find out a doing on my audience just to find out a little< little bit more to see whether they have little bit more to see whether they have been< been profitable training options so this been profitable training options so this way< way I can find out you know how I can way I can find out you know how I can help< help them with the content that I create help them with the content that I create so< so the good news is that actually quite so the good news is that actually quite a< a number of my audience are profitable a number of my audience are profitable right< right as you can see over here they are right as you can see over here they are all< all profitable and one of the common all profitable and one of the common denominator< denominator that I see is that they have denominator that I see is that they have been< been trading for quite some time right been trading for quite some time right more< more than 5 years usually at this point more than 5 years usually at this point you< you should have gotten a good grasp of you should have gotten a good grasp of how< how options should work and you're able how options should work and you're able to< to you know have a strategy where it's to you know have a strategy where it's working< working for you for the long term right working for you for the long term right uh< uh other people 1 to 5 years that's not uh other people 1 to 5 years that's not so< so bad as well some people less than a so bad as well some people less than a year< year and they already profitable right year and they already profitable right so< so this is a good thing and some of you so this is a good thing and some of you have< have actually wrote in to me as well to have actually wrote in to me as well to share< share your results right so this are share your results right so this are some< some of my audience where they have some of my audience where they have written< written into to me to say that you know written into to me to say that you know they< they have used some of my uh strategies they have used some of my uh strategies which< which I shared on YouTube and they've which I shared on YouTube and they've gotten< gotten you know pretty decent results gotten you know pretty decent results with< with it so as you can see over here this with it so as you can see over here this is< is one of my YouTube audience uh he has is one of my YouTube audience uh he has not< not put on that many trades but so far not put on that many trades but so far he< he has been doing pretty well right as he has been doing pretty well right as you< you can see he put on seven trades so you can see he put on seven trades so far< far a 100% winner which is always good far a 100% winner which is always good but< but as I always say you will never get a but as I always say you will never get a 100%< 100% winner if you trade long enough 100% winner if you trade long enough right< right losses will come draw down will right losses will come draw down will come< come losing streaks will happen just a come losing streaks will happen just a matter< matter of time but definitely good to matter of time but definitely good to see< see those winners at the start and at see those winners at the start and at the< the same time as well got quite a number the same time as well got quite a number of< of people have been commenting on my of people have been commenting on my YouTube< YouTube channel saying that they did YouTube channel saying that they did pretty< pretty well as well but at the same time pretty well as well but at the same time for< for those people that have been for those people that have been profitable< profitable there have been many more who profitable there have been many more who have< have not been profitable right so as you have not been profitable right so as you can< can see over here there are quite a can see over here there are quite a number< number of people who have yet to use number of people who have yet to use options< options trading to be profitable for options trading to be profitable for them< them and a number of people have them and a number of people have actually< actually been training options for more actually been training options for more than< than 5 years but they are still not able than 5 years but they are still not able to< to be profitable in fact I have just to be profitable in fact I have just recently< recently spoken to another Trader who recently spoken to another Trader who mentioned< mentioned that for the first seven plus mentioned that for the first seven plus years< years he actually was jumping from years he actually was jumping from strategy< strategy to strategy and was not able to strategy to strategy and was not able to make< make a profit right no matter what he make a profit right no matter what he did< did and one of the biggest thing that he did and one of the biggest thing that he mentioned< mentioned that he couldn't get a profit mentioned that he couldn't get a profit was< was because he wasn't sure what strategy was because he wasn't sure what strategy to< to use and also because he wasn't sure to use and also because he wasn't sure when< when to enter and exit so this are when to enter and exit so this are actually< actually very common common challenges actually very common common challenges that< that many people face so he mentioned that many people face so he mentioned that< that he pretty much wasted seven plus of that he pretty much wasted seven plus of his< his life and realized that he actually his life and realized that he actually over< over comp licated things right you do over comp licated things right you do not< not actually have to make options not actually have to make options trading< trading so complicated so you just have trading so complicated so you just have to< to make the strategy simple in order for to make the strategy simple in order for you< you to be profitable in the long term so you to be profitable in the long term so as< as you can see over here one of the top as you can see over here one of the top challenges< challenges that a number of my audience challenges that a number of my audience have< have mentioned you know why they are not have mentioned you know why they are not profitable< profitable is because of not knowing profitable is because of not knowing what< what strategy to use and also the timing what strategy to use and also the timing right< right as you can see over here it says right as you can see over here it says when< when to exit so this is regarding the when to exit so this is regarding the timing< timing timing wrong timing right seems timing timing wrong timing right seems like< like wrong timing it's trading uh which like wrong timing it's trading uh which strategy< strategy to use and timing and also strategy to use and timing and also trying< trying to find the right underline so if trying to find the right underline so if you< you two have this challenge where you're you two have this challenge where you're not< not sure what strategy to use when to not sure what strategy to use when to enter< enter and exit because of the timing and enter and exit because of the timing and also< also which underlying to choose then also which underlying to choose then this< this video is for you right because I'm this video is for you right because I'm going< going to share with you exactly what going to share with you exactly what strategy< strategy to use what is the underlying strategy to use what is the underlying that< that you're going to trade on and you do that you're going to. trade on and you do not< not have to worry about timing all right not have to worry about timing all right so< so what is this strategy well this so what is this strategy well this strategy< strategy is what I call the Perpetual strategy is what I call the Perpetual put< put spread on spy right so first of all put spread on spy right so first of all why< why spy so as you can see over here this why spy so as you can see over here this is< is the chart of spy for the past right is the chart of spy for the past right 20< 20 years or so and you can see that the 20 years or so and you can see that the market< market has just kept going up so spy is market has just kept going up so spy is a< a positive drift vehicle where the a positive drift vehicle where the market< market wants to go up over the long term market wants to go up over the long term so< so if you were to put on the bullish so if you were to put on the bullish strategy< strategy like the put spread then it's strategy like the put spread then it's naturally< naturally going to be profitable over naturally going to be profitable over the< the long term now at this point you the long term now at this point you might< might have the question you know Davis might have the question you know Davis why< why don't I just buy and whole spy right why don't I just buy and whole spy right if< if I just buy and whole spy I'm going to if I just buy and whole spy I'm going to get< get a return that is pretty decent over get a return that is pretty decent over the< the long term and that is a very good the long term and that is a very good question< question right because if you were to question right because if you were to just< just buy and whole spy the average just buy and whole spy the average return< return is about 8 to 10% per year and return is about 8 to 10% per year and it's< it's definitely much better than if you it's definitely much better than if you were< were to put in the banks so the question were to put in the banks so the question is< is how are options to return compared to is how are options to return compared to buy< buy and hold spy so as you can see over buy and hold spy so as you can see over here< here this is the short put on spy so here this is the short put on spy so first< first of all in the long term it's also first of all in the long term it's also profitable< profitable right it makes sense because profitable right it makes sense because this< this is a bullish strategy short putut this is a bullish strategy short putut is< is a bullish strategy and the market is a bullish strategy and the market keeps< keeps going up in the long term but the keeps going up in the long term but the question< question is does the return actually do question is does the return actually do better< better than if you buy and hold spy for better than if you buy and hold spy for the< the long term well the answer is that it the long term well the answer is that it actually< actually does right because if options actually does right because if options do< do not get a better return than Buy and do not get a better return than Buy and Hold< Hold spy then there's no point for the Hold spy then there's no point for the whole< whole vehicle of options in the first whole vehicle of options in the first place< place right so as you can see over here place right so as you can see over here this< this is a study done by the tasty trade this is a study done by the tasty trade team< team where they put on the 30 Delta team where they put on the 30 Delta short< short putut right so basically what they short putut right so basically what they do< do is that they sell the put option and do is that they sell the put option and then< then once it's either expired or it then once it's either expired or it reaches< reaches the 21 DTE they close it out reaches the 21 DTE they close it out they< they put it on again so you're always in they put it on again so you're always in the< the market right so it's continuous so the market right so it's continuous so as< as you can see regardless whether you as you can see regardless whether you hold< hold to expiration or whether you exit hold to expiration or whether you exit at< at 21 DTE your return is going to be at 21 DTE your return is going to be higher< higher and this is also a pretty higher and this is also a pretty statistically< statistically significant study because statistically significant study because as< as you can see dated all the way back to as you can see dated all the way back to before< before the financial crisis in 2008 and before the financial crisis in 2008 and again< again in the long term it's profitable again in the long term it's profitable now< now what about the put spread right so now what about the put spread right so the< the bull put spread as you can see same the bull put spread as you can see same thing< thing it's profitable as well in the thing it's profitable as well in the long< long term but what about the return and long term but what about the return and as< as you can see over here if you were to as you can see over here if you were to put< put on the put spread regardless whether put on the put spread regardless whether it's< it's the $5 wide or this is what you it's the $5 wide or this is what you call< call the dynamic put spread whereas call the dynamic put spread whereas based< based on Delta you're still going to get based on Delta you're still going to get a< a higher return than if you buy and a higher return than if you buy and whole< whole spy so the whole idea of options whole spy so the whole idea of options is< is to give you a leverage return right is to give you a leverage return right because< because it's leverage but at the same because it's leverage but at the same time< time there's also some risk where you time there's also some risk where you need< need to keep in mind so that you do not need to keep in mind so that you do not over< over leverage to the point whereby if over leverage to the point whereby if there's< there's going to be a crash you're going there's going to be a crash you're going to< to be wiped out so that is why money to be wiped out so that is why money management< management is also very important so if management is also very important so if you< you were to just compare the returns you were to just compare the returns based< based on options versus buy and host buy based on options versus buy and host buy options< options will generate you a better options will generate you a better higher< higher return but it's only if you know higher return but it's only if you know how< how to manage it prop how to manage it prop now< now the next thing you might be asking now the next thing you might be asking is< is Davis instead of just you know is Davis instead of just you know putting< putting on this put spread or the short putting on this put spread or the short put< put continuously why don't I just time put continuously why don't I just time the< the market this way at least you know the market this way at least you know there's< there's a better chance for the trade to there's a better chance for the trade to work< work out rather than you know write it work out rather than you know write it all< all the way down right so that is a very all the way down right so that is a very good< good question and for this let's refer good question and for this let's refer to< to this infographic by JP Morgan by the to this infographic by JP Morgan by the way< way

com blueprint all< all right back to the video so as you all right back to the video so as you can< can see over here this is a very nice can see over here this is a very nice infographic< infographic that tells you you know what infographic that tells you you know what is< is the value of the money let's say you is the value of the money let's say you invested< invested $10,000 in the S&amp;P from this invested $10,000 in the S&amp;P from this period< period right 2003 to 2022 so you can see period right 2003 to 2022 so you can see over< over here that during this time if you over here that during this time if you been< been invested throughout then you can been invested throughout then you can see< see that you will be up about see that you will be up about $64,000< $64,000 on your capital of $10,000 which $64,000 on your capital of $10,000 which is< is pretty good but this is only if you is pretty good but this is only if you have< have invested all days now what happens have invested all days now what happens if< if you try and time the market and you if you try and time the market and you actually< actually miss the 10 best days right as actually miss the 10 best days right as you< you can see if you miss the 10 best days you can see if you miss the 10 best days your< your return the money that you make has your return the money that you make has dropped< dropped significantly all from just 10 dropped significantly all from just 10 days< days out of so many years right this is days out of so many years right this is almost< almost two decades out of. two decades almost two decades out of two decades you< you miss 10 days your return has been you miss 10 days your return has been cut< cut by more than half and what if you cut by more than half and what if you miss< miss the best 20 days as you can see miss the best 20 days as you can see your< your return is going to be even lesser your return is going to be even lesser and< and lesser so if you miss 60 days out of and lesser so if you miss 60 days out of the< the two decades that you have been the two decades that you have been trading< trading SPY then your return is going to trading SPY then your return is going to be< be so mly that you might as well just be so mly that you might as well just buy< buy and hold spy so this is one of the buy and hold spy so this is one of the issues< issues of trying to time the market so issues of trying to time the market so as< as you can see a lot of people they have as you can see a lot of people they have challenges< challenges with timing so instead of challenges with timing so instead of timing< timing the market just be continuously timing the market just be continuously in< in the market but this time using in the market but this time using options< options so as you can see over here they options so as you can see over here they even< even break down the annual return so if even break down the annual return so if you< you are invested in all this then this you are invested in all this then this is< is the average that you get right 99. 8% is the average that you get right 99.

8% which< which is close to 10% for the two which is close to 10% for the two decades< decades from 2003 to 2022 if you miss decades from 2003 to 2022 if you. miss the< the 10 best days then your return has the 10 best days then your return has pretty< pretty much dropped almost to half right pretty much dropped almost to half right 5. 6%< 5.

6% and then if you miss the 20 days 5. 6% and then if you miss the 20 days. you're< you're now down to you're now down to 2.

9%< 2. 9% and at this point it's not even 2.

9% and at this point it's not even better< better than if you were to put inside better than if you were to put inside you< you know T bills and if. you miss the 30 you know T bills and if you miss the 30 best< best days then you pretty much only best days then you pretty much only getting< getting 0. 8% which pretty much means getting 0.

8% which pretty much means that< that there's no point for you to even that there's no point for you to even have< have been trading the spy in the first have been trading the spy in the first place< place so that is why the best timing of place so that is why the best timing of the< the market is just not time it at all be the market is just not time it at all be in< in the market all the time now at this in the market all the time now at this point< point you might be asking but Davis what point you might be asking but Davis what if< if I enter into you know the put spread if I enter into you know the put spread right< right now or the sh put and then it's a right now or the sh put and then it's a bare< bare Market should I continue doing it bare Market should I continue doing it or< or wait until the bare Market is over or wait until the bare Market is over and< and then I do it again well first of all and then I do it again well first of all do< do you even know when the bare Market do you even know when the bare Market will< will end right because by the time it will end right because by the time it ends< ends the market would have already gone ends the market would have already gone up< up way so much higher so again that's up way so much higher so again that's the< the whole problem of timing the market the whole problem of timing the market and< and secondly let's refer to this article and secondly let's refer to this article down< down here by the visual capitalist so down here by the visual capitalist so it's< it's a pretty good article to show you it's a pretty good article to show you why< why timing the market often going to why timing the market often going to lead< lead you to a very very poor performance lead you to a very very poor performance because< because if you were to see here the best because if you were to see here the best days< days take place during the bare markets days take place during the bare markets so< so if you were to actually stop trading so if you were to actually stop trading during< during the bare Market especially the during the bare Market especially the put< put spread or the short put then you're put spread or the short put then you're going< going to miss out the returns right as going to miss out the returns right as you< you can see over here all of this times you can see over here all of this times down< down here where the market has its best down here where the market has its best days< days are during the crashes right as you days are during the crashes right as you can< can see 2008 2008 this is during the can see 2008 2008 this is during the financial< financial crisis the subprime crisis financial crisis the subprime crisis then< then 2020 this is where the pandemic is then 2020 this is where the pandemic is and< and the market has a flash crash and it and the market has a flash crash and it went< went back up right so as you can see went back up right so as you can see most< most of it the best 10 days are actually most of it the best 10 days are actually during< during the 2008 and 2020 so had you during the 2008 and 2020 so had you totally< totally missed this whole period Then totally missed this whole period Then you< you have missed out on the returns right you have missed out on the returns right so< so as you can see seven of the 10 best so as you can see seven of the 10 best days< days happened when the market was in the days happened when the market was in the bare< bare Market territory and then they go bare Market territory and then they go on< on to say adding to this many of the on to say adding to this many of the best< best days take place shortly after the best days take place shortly after the worst< worst days right in 2020 the second best worst days right in 2020 the second best day< day fell right after the second worst day fell right after the second worst day< day that year similarly in 2015 the best day that year similarly in 2015 the best day< day of the year occurred two days after day of the year occurred two days after its< its worst day so interestingly the worst its worst day so interestingly the worst days< days in the market typically occurred in days in the market typically occurred in Bull< Bull markets so if you want to enter Bull markets so if you want to enter only< only during boom markets and you skip only during boom markets and you skip all< all the bare markets chances are that all the bare markets chances are that your< your return is not going to be as good your return is not going to be as good if< if you continue to trade throughout the if you continue to trade throughout the bare< bare market so the question is what if bare market so the question is what if it's< it's the bare market then you should be it's the bare market then you should be happy< happy right because that is the time happy right because that is the time when< when you put on the strategy and you when you put on the strategy and you continuously< continuously put it on without worrying continuously put it on without worrying about< about timing you're going to get the about timing you're going to get the returns< returns whereby these are going to be returns whereby these are going to be the< the best days of your trades so now that the best days of your trades so now that we< we have already established right that we have already established right that we< we don't have to worry about timing and we don't have to worry about timing and we< we can just use a very simple strategy we can just use a very simple strategy just< just on spy how do we get started so I'm just on spy how do we get started so I'm going< going to give you three simple steps to going to give you three simple steps to get< get started on this Perpetual put spread get started on this Perpetual put spread so< so step one sell the 20 to 30 Delta bull so step one sell the 20 to 30 Delta bull put< put spread so basically the bull put put spread so basically the bull put spread< spread has the short putut and then you spread has the short putut and then you have< have the long putut so for this short have the long putut so for this short putut< putut part go for the 20 to 30 Delta putut part go for the 20 to 30 Delta Mark< Mark so how do you know what's the 20 to Mark so how do you know what's the 20 to 30< 30 Delta Mark all you got to do is take 30 Delta Mark all you got to do is take a< a look at your option chain and take a a look at your option chain and take a look< look at the Delta column this is where look at the Delta column this is where it< it will tell you what's the Delta so you it will tell you what's the Delta so you can< can pick anywhere from 20 to 30 Deltas can pick anywhere from 20 to 30 Deltas so< so why 20 to 30 Deltas well that's so why 20 to 30 Deltas well that's because< because that's the study that I've because that's the study that I've actually< actually shown you guys right so this is actually shown you guys right so this is based< based on the T trade studies and as you based on the T trade studies and as you can< can see they use either 30 Delta put or can see they use either 30 Delta put or in< in this case this will be the 20 Delta in this case this will be the 20 Delta put< put spread right so either 20 to 30 put spread right so either 20 to 30 Deltas< Deltas they're both fine depending on Deltas they're both fine depending on how< how aggressive or much more conservative how aggressive or much more conservative you< you are and then go for about $5 to $10 you are and then go for about $5 to $10 wide< wide depending on. your own account size wide depending on your own account size so< so you definitely can do this if you so you definitely can do this if you have< have a small account and then choose have a small account and then choose around< around 45 dtes because as you know that around 45 dtes because as you know that is< is the place whereby the realized move is the place whereby the realized move is< is often a Time lesser than the expected is often a Time lesser than the expected move< move and this is our Edge in options move and this is our Edge in options trading< trading if you do not utilize the 45 DTE trading if you do not utilize the 45 DTE if< if you go lesser than that then chances if you go lesser than that then chances are< are this Edge will not be prevalent in are this Edge will not be prevalent in your< your trade so to play it safe we stay your trade so to play it safe we stay around< around the 45 DTE now step two when it's around the 45 DTE now step two when it's 21< 21 DTE that means when there's 21 days 21 DTE that means when there's 21 days left< left to expiration close it so how do left to expiration close it so how do you< you know when it's 21 DTE it's very you know when it's 21 DTE it's very simple< simple so if you start off with 45 DTE simple so if you start off with 45 DTE thereabouts< thereabouts all you got to do is just thereabouts all you got to do is just wait< wait until it drops down to 21 days left wait until it drops down to 21 days left to< to expiration and then you close out to expiration and then you close out this< this trade so your holding period on this trade so your holding period on average< average will be about 24 days so as you average will be about 24 days so as you can< can see this is not a very intensive can see this is not a very intensive management< management kind of strategy just put it management kind of strategy just put it on< on go on to do your own things during on go on to do your own things during the< the day you know go about your work and the day you know go about your work and then< then only once it's closed to this date then only once it's closed to this date right< right 21 DT open up your platform close right 21 DT open up your platform close it< it out and then go to step three back to it out and then go to step three back to Step< Step One basically open up the trade Step One basically open up the trade again< again rinse and repeat and here's the again rinse and repeat and here's the key< key thing about 21 DT is to close it key thing about 21 DT is to close it regardless< regardless if it's a profit or loss regardless if it's a profit or loss because< because it is already taken into account because it is already taken into account based< based on the studies as you can see over based on the studies as you can see over here< here right so in the long term as long here right so in the long term as long as< as you do this on spy you are going to as you do this on spy you are going to get< get a long-term profit that is going to get a long-term profit that is going to be< be better than a Buy and Hold spy now be better than a Buy and Hold spy now the< the question you might probably have is the question you might probably have is but< but Davis will it always be profitable but Davis will it always be profitable right< right every single year and the answer right every single year and the answer is< is of course not guys you need to is of course not guys you need to understand< understand that when we are training understand that when we are training options< options it's not like some miracle uh options it's not like some miracle uh vehicle< vehicle whereby you will never lose vehicle whereby you will never lose right< right there will still be losses right right there will still be losses right even< even just by the win rate alone even even just by the win rate alone even though< though if it's a 80% win rate or 90% win though if it's a 80% win rate or 90% win rate< rate there can be a 10 to 20% chance of rate there can be a 10 to 20%

### Short Put Mastery (Entries, Exits & Adjustments) [68fMiCI6bx8]
==================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so today's topic is all right all righty so today's topic is on< on shut Mastery I'm going to give you on shut Mastery I'm going to give you some< some guidelines on entries exits as well some guidelines on entries exits as well as< as adjustments all right so let's get as adjustments all right so let's get into< into it so what is the short putut now into it so what is the short putut now previously< previously I created a number of videos previously I created a number of videos on< on the cash secure putut now the cash on the cash secure putut now the cash secure< secure putut is basically also a short secure putut is basically also a short putut< putut but the difference with this video putut but the difference with this video and< and the other video on cash SEC putut is and the other video on cash SEC putut is that< that with the cash secure put your that with the cash secure put your intention< intention is to actually buy 100 shares intention is to actually buy 100 shares of< of the underlying stock that means you of the underlying stock that means you just< just enter the uh cash secure put at the just enter the uh cash secure put at the strike< strike price which you want to buy the strike price which you want to buy the stock< stock at and then you just wait for it stock at and then you just wait for it to< to be assigned right but for this video to be assigned right but for this video we're< we're going to be talking about the we're going to be talking about the short< short put in a sense where we are going short put in a sense where we are going to< to be trading the option right we're not to be trading the option right we're not going< going to be uh planning to get assigned going to be uh planning to get assigned on< on the 100 shares we just only want to on the 100 shares we just only want to get< get in and get out and try and collect get in and get out and try and collect as< as much premium as possible and if the as much premium as possible and if the market< market is to go you know quite far down market is to go you know quite far down we're< we're going to try and cut loss as well we're going to try and cut loss as well so< so this is a different strategy from the so this is a different strategy from the cash< cash secure put so for the short putut cash secure put so for the short putut this< this is a neutral to bullish strategy this is a neutral to bullish strategy and< and uh you're selling a put option so and uh you're selling a put option so you're< you're going to be receiving a a premium you're going to be receiving a a premium for< for it so this is a higher probability for it so this is a higher probability undefined< undefined risk strategy so as you can undefined risk strategy so as you can see< see most of the time when we sell the see most of the time when we sell the put< put option we're going to be selling a put option we're going to be selling a strike< strike price that is quite a distance strike price that is quite a distance away< away from the market price right so this away from the market price right so this is< is the market price this is where a is the market price this is where a strike< strike price so in this sense we're strike price so in this sense we're going< going to have a higher than 50% going to have a higher than 50% probability< probability of win so even though if probability of win so even though if you're< you're slightly wrong on your direction you're slightly wrong on your direction that< that means if you sell the strike price that means if you sell the strike price here< here and Market starts to go down here and Market starts to go down somewhere< somewhere with within this region you'd somewhere with within this region you'd still< still be able to profit right unlike if still be able to profit right unlike if you< you were to just buy an outright uh you were to just buy an outright uh stock< stock you just buy the shares outright stock you just buy the shares outright you< you need the market to go above where you need the market to go above where you< you bought it in order for you to profit you bought it in order for you to profit anything< anything below will be a loss so this is anything below will be a loss so this is where< where the short put has an advantage in where the short put has an advantage in terms< terms of the probability of win so terms of the probability of win so because< because we are not intending to buy 100 because we are not intending to buy 100 shares< shares of the underlying stock this is shares of the underlying stock this is considered< considered a naked put right so a naked considered a naked put right so a naked put< put you only have to just put up the put you only have to just put up the margin< margin much lesser than what you need margin much lesser than what you need need< need to buy 100 shares of the stock so need to buy 100 shares of the stock so most< most of the time it's about 10% of 100 most of the time it's about 10% of 100 shares< shares of the underlying stock so for shares of the underlying stock so for example< example if the strike price is 100 and example if the strike price is 100 and you< you to buy 100 shares of it that would you to buy 100 shares of it that would be< be $10,000 but if you're going to just be $10,000 but if you're going to just sell< sell the put option most of the time you sell the put option most of the time you probably< probably can put up only 10% of that probably can put up only 10% of that that< that means all you need to do is just that means all you need to do is just put< put up $11,000 that means if you have an put up $11,000 that means if you have an account< account of roughly $5,000 you can still account of roughly $5,000 you can still put< put up this trade but the problem with put up this trade but the problem with this< this trade is that you can actually lose this trade is that you can actually lose more< more than what it put up in terms of more than what it put up in terms of this< this margin because this is what you this margin because this is what you call< call an undefined risk strategy so that call an undefined risk strategy so that means< means if the stock really does go to means if the stock really does go to zero< zero and then you hold on to this short zero and then you hold on to this short put< put all the way to zero you're going to put all the way to zero you're going to lose< lose much more than $1,000 in fact most lose much more than $1,000 in fact most likely< likely you're going to lose everything likely you're going to lose everything that< that you have in your account if your that you have in your account if your account< account size is like $5,000 because the account size is like $5,000 because the full< full position is full position is $10,000< $10,000 right at a strike price of100 so $10,000 right at a strike price of100 so if< if it goes to zero you will lose if it goes to zero you will lose $110,000< $110,000 theoretically right but if you $110,000 theoretically right but if you only< only got $5,000 your broker is going to only got $5,000 your broker is going to Margin< Margin Call you and once you run out of Margin Call you and once you run out of the< the the cash you need for this position the the cash you need for this position they're< they're going to cut out this whole they're going to cut out this whole position< position you're going to be uh facing a position you're going to be uh facing a big< big loss so when it comes to selling big loss so when it comes to selling naked< naked put option risk management is very naked put option risk management is very important< important it is key all right so let's important it is key all right so let's take< take a look at some trade mechanics so take a look. at some trade mechanics so for< for this strategy we want to be looking for this strategy we want to be looking at< at a DTE that is a days to expiration at a DTE that is a days to expiration roughly< roughly 30 to 60 days right optimally we roughly 30 to 60 days right optimally we want< want somewhere around 45 days because want somewhere around 45 days because that's< that's when the Theta Decay is the most that's when the Theta Decay is the most optimal< optimal anything that is longer than 60 optimal anything that is longer than 60 days< days the Theta Decay won't really be days the Theta Decay won't really be there< there right next we want to go for a there right next we want to go for a Delta< Delta roughly 20 to 30 so this way we Delta roughly 20 to 30 so this way we are< are be able to you know collect quite uh are be able to you know collect quite uh decent< decent premium at the same time it's not decent premium at the same time it's not too< too near the market price now as for too near the market price now as for products< products to trade generally I like to products to trade generally I like to trade< trade the shut on the index ETFs right I trade the shut on the index ETFs right I like< like to trade it on what I call the like to trade it on what I call the Fantastic< Fantastic 4 which is the diamonds Fantastic 4 which is the diamonds spiders< spiders qqs and iwm now the thing is spiders qqs and iwm now the thing is that< that most in fact all four of this are that most in fact all four of this are pretty< pretty high price right the the cheapest pretty high price right the the cheapest would< would be iwm where it's around $190 as would be iwm where it's around $190 as of< of this video recording so for you to of this video recording so for you to put< put up this uh margin you need quite a put up this uh margin you need quite a big< big account so if you have a smaller big account so if you have a smaller account< account let's say anything from $10,000 account let's say anything from $10,000 and< and Below you might want to go for uh and Below you might want to go for uh individual< individual stocks right go individual individual stocks right go individual stocks< stocks that are lower price around $50 stocks that are lower price around $50 or< or so right so for this you want to go or so right so for this you want to go for< for highly liquid stocks right if you go for highly liquid stocks right if you go for< for very El liquid stocks it's going to for very El liquid stocks it's going to be< be very hard for you to do some be very hard for you to do some adjustments< adjustments later on especially if you adjustments later on especially if you want< want to do some rolling of your put want to do some rolling of your put options< options so how do you tell whether the options so how do you tell whether the stock< stock is liquid so one simple way to to stock is liquid so one simple way to to see< see this is basically to find the stocks see this is basically to find the stocks that< that have weekly options and that they that have weekly options and that they have< have type bitr spreads right so if you have type bitr spreads right so if you open< open up a stock and you see that the open up a stock and you see that the option< option chain doesn't have any weekly option chain doesn't have any weekly options< options then uh it's going to be quite options then uh it's going to be quite uh< uh a question mark down there whether uh a question mark down there whether there's< there's going to be liquidity there uh there's going to be liquidity there uh chances< chances are that if there's no weekly chances are that if there's no weekly options< options it's not going to be that liid options it's not going to be that liid next< next you can take a look at the beta next you can take a look at the beta spread< spread of the option chain itself of the spread of the option chain itself of the individual< individual options if you see that the individual options if you see that the beta< beta spread is pretty wide there more beta spread is pretty wide there more like< like 20 cents 50 cents a dollar or so like 20 cents 50 cents a dollar or so then< then you know that is very El liquid and then you know that is very El liquid and you< you want to stay away from those stocks you want to stay away from those stocks so< so you only want to go for stocks which so you only want to go for stocks which has< has very tight bit ass spread next for has very tight bit ass spread next for trading< trading sizing so this is very important trading sizing so this is very important right< right because you're not planning to buy right because you're not planning to buy the< the underlying stock you're not planning the underlying stock you're not planning to< to get a sign on the 100 shares what you to get a sign on the 100 shares what you need< need to take note of is the buying power need to take note of is the buying power uh< uh reduction so in the the think of uh reduction so in the the think of Swing< Swing platform it's what you call the Swing platform it's what you call the buying< buying power effect so this is the buying power effect so this is the margin< margin which you actually have to put up margin which you actually have to put up for< for this position the broker when they for this position the broker when they put< put when you put up this position with put when you put up this position with the< the broker the risk uh is all on the the broker the risk uh is all on the broker< broker so they want to put up a certain broker so they want to put up a certain amount< amount which they feel they are amount which they feel they are comfortable< comfortable as a risk uh measure to take comfortable as a risk uh measure to take from< from you so that's why they have this from you so that's why they have this buying< buying power effect because this is an buying power effect because this is an undefined< undefined risk strategy the way we want undefined risk strategy the way we want to< to Define our risk in a sense is by the to Define our risk in a sense is by the buying< buying power effect that means for us uh buying power effect that means for us uh I< I will see this as the max risk that I I will see this as the max risk that I want< want to take on this trade okay so that want to take on this trade okay so that means< means if the trade goes to somewhere means if the trade goes to somewhere around< around a loss of around 2,97 I'm going around a loss of around 2,97 I'm going to< to get out of the trade okay so this is to get out of the trade okay so this is very< very important to understand because very important to understand because this< this is how we're going to size our this is how we're going to size our trade< trade so maximum you want to size this trade so maximum you want to size this buying< buying power reduction all right per buying power reduction all right per trade< trade of it has to be maximum 1 to5 % of trade of it has to be maximum 1 to5 % of your< your capital okay let's say for example your capital okay let's say for example your< your account size is $100,000 if your account size is $100,000 if $100,000< $100,000 that means on each trade you $100,000 that means on each trade you can< can place up to ,000 to $5,000 in terms can place up to ,000 to $5,000 in terms of< of buying power reduction right so that of buying power reduction right so that means< means it's the the risk the amount means it's the the risk the amount you're< you're planing to risk so in this case you're planing to risk so in this case let's< let's say if you're $100,000 and you see let's say if you're $100,000 and you see that< that the buying power effect is that the buying power effect is 2,97< 2,97 so it's roughly about 2. 2% which 2,97 so it's roughly about 2.

2% which means< means to say this is an okay size for means to say this is an okay size for you< you to take the trade in so you can go you to take the trade in so you can go ahead< ahead and take this trade now what if ahead and take this trade now what if your< your trading account size is much your trading account size is much smaller< smaller right let's say if you have 20K smaller right let's say if you have 20K or< or 10K now if you were to take a look at or 10K now if you were to take a look at this< this trade them so $2,000 out of $10,000 this trade them so $2,000 out of $10,000 will< will be about 22% of your Capital so in will be about 22% of your Capital so in this< this case it's going to be exceeding the this case it's going to be exceeding the max< max of 5 to 10% right so because your max of 5 to 10% right so because your account< account is much smaller you can account account is much smaller you can account for< for slightly uh bigger because you're for slightly uh bigger because you're going< going to be it's going to be quite hard going to be it's going to be quite hard for< for you to find some trades that's 1 to for you to find some trades that's 1 to 5%< 5% if your account is going to be very 5% if your account is going to be very small< small so for a smaller account can go up small so for a smaller account can go up to< to 5 to 10% but ideally I want to stick to 5 to 10% but ideally I want to stick to< to around 5% because it is possible to to around 5% because it is possible to take< take loss on some of this trade so take loss on some of this trade so that's< that's why you want to limit the maximum that's why you want to limit the maximum loss< loss to about 5% each time so if you 5% loss to about 5% each time so if you 5% uh< uh maximum risk for each trade that uh maximum risk for each trade that means< means you have about 20 trades to go means you have about 20 trades to go this< this is very important if you risk this is very important if you risk everything< everything on just one two trades your everything on just one two trades your account< account can easily wipe out so you want account can easily wipe out so you want to< to let the probabilities play out in the to let the probabilities play out in the long< long term so even though it is a 77% long term so even though it is a 77% trade< trade uh probability of win or 8 % trade uh probability of win or 8 % probability< probability or win there is still the probability or win there is still the chance< chance that you can hit the 20% on the chance that you can hit the 20% on the first< first trade and you're going to lose first trade and you're going to lose there< there so that is why you need to be able there so that is why you need to be able to< to size it small enough so that you stay to size it small enough so that you stay in< in the game long enough to be able to be in the game long enough to be able to be profitable< profitable so risk management uh you profitable so risk management uh you want< want to cut off at the buying power want to cut off at the buying power reduction< reduction if you see that on this reduction if you see that on this position< position itself you're losing roughly position itself you're losing roughly the< the buying power effect that is where the buying power effect that is where you< you want to cut the position and then you want to cut the position and then start< start a new trade again right find start a new trade again right find another< another trade you don't want to let one another trade you don't want to let one trade< trade wipe out your whole account all trade wipe out your whole account all right< right so let's take a look at some trade right so let's take a look at some trade management< management so for entries uh basically management so for entries uh basically you< you want to take a look at just two you want to take a look at just two things< things just look at stochastic it's things just look at stochastic it's overso< overso and at or below a support level overso and at or below a support level so< so I've already previously created a so I've already previously created a video< video specifically on entries so you can video specifically on entries so you can go< go ahead and check out the video at the go ahead and check out the video at the top< top right hand corner now next is top right hand corner now next is adjustments< adjustments so adjustments basically is adjustments so adjustments basically is rolling< rolling what do you do right so there rolling what do you do right so there are< are two ways to adjust your short putut are two ways to adjust your short putut right< right the first method is when your right the first method is when your strike< strike price or your break even is strike price or your break even is breached< breached so for example this is the the breached so for example this is the the stock< stock price right now stock price right now let's< let's say you saw a short put somewhere let's say you saw a short put somewhere around< around here now when do you start around here now when do you start rolling< rolling most of the time you start to rolling most of the time you start to roll< roll when the market actually goes past roll when the market actually goes past this< this short putut all right so this is this short putut all right so this is where< where you start to roll out or roll out where you start to roll out or roll out and< and down right for the first method and and down right for the first method and for< for the second method you can just wait for the second method you can just wait until< until DTE 21 to 30 and then you see if until DTE 21 to 30 and then you see if it's< it's in the money or out of the money if it's in the money or out of the money if it's< it's out of money you pretty much do it's out of money you pretty much do nothing< nothing but it's in the money that's nothing but it's in the. money that's where< where you want to roll and the reason where you want to roll and the reason why< why you want to do it around 21 to 30 why you want to do it around 21 to 30 DTE< DTE that's because that's when gamma DTE that's because that's when gamma starts< starts to pick up right so gamma is a starts to pick up right so gamma is a risk< risk for naked options because as it risk for naked options because as it gets< gets closer to expiration date your p&amp;l gets closer to expiration date your p&amp;l volatility< volatility is going to high especially volatility is going to high especially at< at the money so that is when you want to at the money so that is when you want to look< look out for the position to start to look out for the position to start to roll< roll all right so I've also created a roll all right so I've also created a video< video on uh rolling shot puts you can go video on uh rolling shot puts you can go ahead< ahead and watch that I put a link at the ahead and watch that I put a link at the top< top right hand corner as well next what top right hand corner as well next what do< do you want to do in terms of exits so do you want to do in terms of exits so exits< exits pretty simple for take profit you exits pretty simple for take profit you want< want to take profit at around 50% and want to take profit at around 50% and then< then we cut loss right there's two ways then we cut loss right there's two ways to< to cut loss number one is you want to to cut loss number one is you want to cut< cut loss when it hits your buying power cut loss when it hits your buying power reduction< reduction right this is uh my preferred reduction right this is uh my preferred approach< approach secondly is when loss is about approach secondly is when loss is about three< three times the credit receip by the way three times the credit receip by the way if< if this video has been helpful so far if this video has been helpful so far I'd< I'd appreciate if you hit the thumbs up I'd appreciate if you hit the thumbs up button< button and also subscribe to my channel button and also subscribe to my channel so< so I can create more videos like this so I can create more videos like this for< for you in the future okay back to the for you in the future okay back to the video< video all right so let's get into a video all right so let's get into a trade< trade that I just placed I'm going to trade that I just placed I'm going to share< share a view what I saw on the chart and share a view what I saw on the chart and then< then how I I actually uh played is the then how I I actually uh played is the trade< trade what's going on in my mind I'm trade what's going on in my mind I'm going< going to share with you my game plan as going to share with you my game plan as well< well so I'm going to walk through this well so I'm going to walk through this whole< whole process with you so that you can whole process with you so that you can identify< identify opportunities right to sell put identify opportunities right to sell put options< options as options as well< well so first of all what do I want to well so first of all what do I want to look< look out for when I look at the chart look out for when I look at the chart right< right so first off I want to look at the right so first off I want to look at the stochastics< stochastics if it's oversold so as you stochastics if it's oversold so as you can< can see remember the two criterias is can see remember the two criterias is pretty< pretty simple just take a look at pretty simple just take a look at stochastics< stochastics if it's oversold and next we stochastics if it's oversold and next we want< want to take a look at support areas want to take a look at support areas right< right support levels previous low so you right support levels previous low so you can< can see down here there are quite a can see down here there are quite a number< number of previous lows so this whole number of previous lows so this whole area< area down here are all support areas area down here are all support areas right< right so what you do is just draw a box right so what you do is just draw a box across< across and then you can see this is how across and then you can see this is how we< we can identify our short putut setup so we can identify our short putut setup so now< now we know that the conditions have now we know that the conditions have been< been met we have a uh stochastics that's been met we have a uh stochastics that's showing< showing is oversold and then there's a showing is oversold and then there's a support< support level which is where I want to support level which is where I want to place< place my short put is either at or below place my short put is either at or below the< the support area so there's a good the support area so there's a good chance< chance if the market comes down here it chance if the market comes down here it can< can bounce back up which is very good can bounce back up which is very good for< for our short putut so once I've for our short putut so once I've identified< identified this the next thing I'll do identified this the next thing I'll do is< is I will take a look at the option is I will take a look at the option chain< chain right so what we want to look for chain right so what we want to look for is< is roughly 20 to 30 Deltas when we're is roughly 20 to 30 Deltas when we're selling< selling a put option at around the selling a put option at around the strike< strike price of our choice right so when strike price of our choice right so when I< I take a look at this chart I'm looking I take a look at this chart I'm looking to< to sell somewhere from uh this point to to sell somewhere from uh this point to here< here right now the previous low is here here right now the previous low is here all< all right so that is above 100 so around all right so that is above 100 so around 100< 100 to 102. 5 $53 that is a pretty good 100 to 102.

5 $53 that is a pretty good candidate< candidate for us to go and sell our put candidate for us to go and sell our put option< option so we want to take a look at the option so we want to take a look at the option< option chain to see which is the good option chain to see which is the good candidate< candidate for us to choose so when I candidate for us to choose so when I look< look at this option chain I want to find look at this option chain I want to find those< those that is from 20 to 30 Deltas so those that is from 20 to 30 Deltas so from< from here you can see that there are from here you can see that there are four< four strikes that uh hit our criteria four strikes that uh hit our criteria right< right four strikes from 20 to 30 Deltas right four strikes from 20 to 30 Deltas so< so any one of this can be good so it so any one of this can be good so it comes< comes down to which one you feel comes down to which one you feel comfortable< comfortable with right you want to comfortable with right you want to balance< balance in terms of you don't want to be balance in terms of you don't want to be too< too near the market right in a sense too near the market right in a sense where< where right the further away you are where right the further away you are from< from the market price the higher from the market price the higher probability< probability to trade but then if you probability to trade but then if you choose< choose too far a strike price your choose too far a strike price your premium< premium is not going to be that much as premium is not going to be that much as well< well so from this four strike what I well so from this four strike what I like< like to see is the 100 strike price I'm like to see is the 100 strike price I'm more< more leaning towards the 100 strike more leaning towards the 100 strike price< price where I can collect roughly you price where I can collect roughly you know know know $241< $241 so that's about $241 so that's about $241< $241 so when I've identify the strike $241 so when I've identify the strike price< price the next thing I want to do is I price the next thing I want to do is I want< want to take a look at the buying power want to take a look at the buying power reduction< reduction right the buying power effect reduction right the buying power effect so< so you put up the other ticket so this so you put up the other ticket so this is< is in think of swim so you can see the is in think of swim so you can see the buying< buying power is buying power is $1,213< $1,213 so you want to ensure that this $1,213 so you want to ensure that this buying< buying power effect is roughly about 1 buying power effect is roughly about 1 to< to 5% of your account if you're about to 5% of your account if you're about $100,000< $100,000 or more or 5 to 10% at most if $100,000 or more or 5 to 10% at most if you< you have a smaller account around you you have a smaller account around you know< know 20,000 or $10,000 around there know 20,000 or $10,000 around there right< right so as you can see for me uh I right so as you can see for me uh I still< still have quite a lot of buying power still have quite a lot of buying power you< you can see that even after this buying you can see that even after this buying power< power effect reduction I still have over power effect reduction I still have over 400< 400 ,000 left for options right so as 400 ,000 left for options right so as you< you can see this is actually a live you can see this is actually a live account< account this is not a demo account you account this is not a demo account you can< can see down here you can see my name can see down here you can see my name down< down here okay so for me this trade is down here okay so for me this trade is actually< actually pretty small so I would actually pretty small so I would definitely< definitely be inclined to go ahead to definitely be inclined to go ahead to place< place this trade which is what I did so place this trade which is what I did so for< for you you want to take a look at your for you you want to take a look at your size< size as well if it's too big you size as well if it's too big you definitely< definitely do not want to place the definitely do not want to place the trade< trade so now that I know what's the trade so now that I know what's the buying< buying power effect and I know it's the buying power effect and I know it's the the< the right size the next thing I want to the right size the next thing I want to do< do is you know what's the credit that I do is you know what's the credit that I receive< receive so the credit of the commission receive so the credit of the commission is< is $240 and I want to calculate roughly is $240 and I want to calculate roughly you< you know what is the percentage that I'm you know what is the percentage that I'm receiving< receiving in terms of the risk that I receiving in terms of the risk that I have< have right so remember buying power have right so remember buying power effect< effect is going to be a risk that means effect is going to be a risk that means if< if I hit roughly $1,200 of loss I'm just if I hit roughly $1,200 of loss I'm just going< going to close out the trade for a loss going to close out the trade for a loss so< so the premium which we receive on top so the premium which we receive on top. of< of that all for this we divide it by the of that all for this we divide it by the buying< buying power effect is roughly 20% Which buying power effect is roughly 20% Which is< is pretty good right so I I'm looking is pretty good right so I I'm looking somewhere< somewhere around 20% all right the somewhere around 20% all right the lowest< lowest I would go probably would be 10% lowest I would go probably would be 10% but< but 20% 30% that is a very good am but 20% 30% that is a very good am because< because remember we only be going to because remember we only be going to collect< collect about 50% of the credit all collect about 50% of the credit all right< right so that's what I did I went ahead right so that's what I did I went ahead to< to sell the short put at 100 strike to sell the short put at 100 strike price< price I sold the 100 strike price with a price I sold the 100 strike price with a DTE< DTE of 53 so it's within the 30 to 60 DTE of 53 so it's within the 30 to 60 days< days and I received a credit of days and I received a credit of $241< $241 so let's get into the game plan so $241 so let's get into the game plan so the< the game plan is what I'm going to do the game plan is what I'm going to do depending< depending on the different scenario so depending on the different scenario so again< again this is very important for you to again this is very important for you to map< map out as well before you place the map out as well before you place the trade< trade because once you get into the trade because once you get into the trade< trade you do not want any surprises you trade you do not want any surprises you don't< don't know what to do right if the don't know what to do right if the market< market crashes or Market goes up you market crashes or Market goes up you want< want to know what to do at every point want to know what to do at every point in< in time so you won't suddenly get into a in time so you won't suddenly get into a shock< shock and wonder what do I do you know shock and wonder what do I do you know and< and you panic so I've ma out the and you panic so I've ma out the different< different scenarios and I plan them different scenarios and I plan them accordingly< accordingly so the first scenario is if accordingly so the first scenario is if Google< Google stays above $100 now this is the Google stays above $100 now this is the best< best scenario for us basically what I do best scenario for us basically what I do is< is I'll do nothing right I'll just place is I'll do nothing right I'll just place a< a a take profit at 50% of Premium if it a a take profit at 50% of Premium if it reaches< reaches it if it doesn't even though if reaches it if it doesn't even though if the< the market goes down and it's close to the market goes down and it's close to my< my strike price and I'm seeing a loss on my strike price and I'm seeing a loss on the< the shut although I'm seeing a loss I'm the shut although I'm seeing a loss I'm still< still doing nothing right because I just still doing nothing right because I just want< want to let the probabilities play out want to let the probabilities play out it< it could bounce up in the end you know it could bounce up in the end you know so< so you never know so what's important so you never know so what's important down< down here is not to react too early you down here is not to react too early you don't< don't want to roll your shut too early don't want to roll your shut too early you< you don't want to close your trade just you don't want to close your trade just because< because you see a little bit of loss because you see a little bit of loss okay< okay so scenario number two now what if okay so scenario number two now what if Google< Google goes below $100 so this is where Google goes below $100 so this is where your< your strike has been breached right it your strike has been breached right it has< has gone below your strike price so this has gone below your strike price so this is< is where you want to consider taking is where you want to consider taking certain< certain actions so the next thing you certain actions so the next thing you want< want to look at is the risk profile of want to look at is the risk profile of your< your SHP right you want to see exactly your SHP right you want to see exactly where< where is the place where you're going to where is the place where you're going to hit< hit your max loss in terms of buying hit your max loss in terms of buying power< power effect so if we take a look at the power effect so if we take a look at the risk< risk profile you can see that at $86 45 risk profile you can see that at $86 45 cents< cents this is where our lose roughly cents this is where our lose roughly $1,211< $1,211 which is roughly our buying power $1,211 which is roughly our buying power effect< effect so at this point of time if it effect so at this point of time if it hits< hits this price today right this is hits this price today right this is where< where the loss is now over time of where the loss is now over time of course< course because with the Theta effect course because with the Theta effect it's< it's going to start to lose slightly it's going to start to lose slightly lesser< lesser but as of today if the market for lesser but as of today if the market for some< some reason somehow Spikes all the way some reason somehow Spikes all the way down< down to 86. 4 five this is where I know down to 86.

4 five this is where I know I'm< I'm going to have to get out of my I'm going to have to get out of my position< position I'm going to cut loss I'm going position I'm going to cut loss I'm going to< to take a loss and then uh close the to take a loss and then uh close the trade< trade and then go for another trade now trade and then go for another trade now the< the chances of that happening is very the chances of that happening is very unlikely< unlikely but of course we want to plan unlikely but of course we want to plan for< for the worst case scenario in case for the worst case scenario in case another< another pandemic comes you know the another pandemic comes you know the market< market starts to crash so this risk market starts to crash so this risk profile< profile you notice that there is this profile you notice that there is this box< box down here right so this is what you box down here right so this is what you call< call the one standard deviation box that call the one standard deviation box that means< means chances are the market will be in means chances are the market will be in between< between this box price by expiration so between this box price by expiration so as< as you can see the chances of it as you can see the chances of it actually< actually going down to hit our Max loss actually going down to hit our Max loss by< by the. expiration date is not very high by the expiration date is not very high okay< okay so that's one thing you want to okay so that's one thing you want to take< take note of next thing you want to take take note of next thing you want to take note< note of is where is your break even note of is where is your break even price< price your break even price is basically price your break even price is basically a< a strike price minus the credit you a strike price minus the credit you receive< receive so in this case it's roughly receive so in this case it's roughly $976< $976 for me so the place you want to $976 for me so the place you want to take< take action to roll your short putut is take action to roll your short putut is either< either when it breaches your strike either when it breaches your strike price< price or when it breaches your break price or when it breaches your break even< even okay so now that I know exactly even okay so now that I know exactly where< where my worst price is for me to cut where my worst price is for me to cut off< off my short putut right this is where I off my short putut right this is where I can< can start to plan so for me if the price can start to plan so for me if the price all< all right is below my break even but all right is below my break even but above above above 86. 4< 86.

4 so this is what I'm going to do if 86. 4 so this is what I'm going to do if it's< it's the DTE more than 30 days left I'm it's the DTE more than 30 days left I'm not< not going to do anything because there's not going to do anything because there's still< still too much time if I'm going to roll still too much time if I'm going to roll I'm< I'm going to start to roll to too far I'm going to start to roll to too far away< away and that's ideally not what I do away and that's ideally not what I do because< because if you're going to roll to too because if you're going to roll to too far< far away the there's not going to be a far away the there's not going to be a Theta< Theta Decay and the trade you know gets Theta Decay and the trade you know gets into< into too long so most of the time I'm into too long so most of the time I'm just< just going to let the trade play out just going to let the trade play out there's< there's always a chance that the market there's always a chance that the market comes< comes down here and then it bounce back comes down here and then it bounce back up< up again and then. it could expire at up again and then it could expire at this< this point you're going to maybe you this point you're going to maybe you could< could even receive the 50% profit by could even receive the 50% profit by then< then right so as long as the days to then right so as long as the days to expiration< expiration is more than 30 I just do expiration is more than 30 I just do nothing< nothing now when it gets below 30 days nothing now when it gets below 30 days anywhere< anywhere from 21 to 30 days this is anywhere from 21 to 30 days this is where< where I will consider rolling right so where I will consider rolling right so if< if it's really deep in the money you may if it's really deep in the money you may only< only be able to just roll out to the only be able to just roll out to the same< same strike but if it's just below down same strike but if it's just below down here< here not too far away you can still roll here not too far away you can still roll out< out and you roll down as well so what out and you roll down as well so what happens< happens if it touches 86.

4 remember 86. 4 happens if it touches 86.

4 remember 86. 4 5< 5 is where it roughly hits our Max loss 5 is where it roughly hits our Max loss of< of our buying power reduction so this is of our buying power reduction so this is where< where I'm looking to cut loss I'll just where I'm looking to cut loss I'll just take< take the loss and move on to another take the loss and move on to another trade< trade I'm not going to let this trade trade I'm not going to let this trade become< become an even bigger become an even bigger loser< loser now the third scenario and the loser now the third scenario and the last< last scenario is what happens after last scenario is what happens after rolling< rolling right so after After Rolling the rolling right so after After Rolling the trade< trade still continues it doesn't end trade still continues it doesn't end there< there so if Google continues dropping there so if Google continues dropping and< and reaches the max loss the buying and reaches the max loss the buying power< power reduction after all credit power reduction after all credit receives< receives this is where you want to cut receives this is where you want to cut loss< loss right so if your pnl is showing loss right so if your pnl is showing that< that you're losing $1,200 around there that you're losing $1,200 around there after< after the credit they have received then after the credit they have received then this< this is where you want to cut loss now this is where you want to cut loss now if< if Google hasn't hit Max loss and it's if Google hasn't hit Max loss and it's still< still more than DTE 30 days again I do still more than DTE 30 days again I do nothing< nothing right there's nothing to do just nothing right there's nothing to do just wait< wait for the trade to work out but if it wait for the trade to work out but if it starts< starts to go below 21 to 30 days days starts to go below 21 to 30 days days this< this is where I'll start to roll so this is where I'll start to roll so either< either roll out or roll down all right either roll out or roll down all right guys< guys so this is how I actually look for guys so this is how I actually look for opportunities< opportunities to place a short putut now opportunities to place a short putut now you< you can take this guideline right and you can take this guideline right and then< then just make it your own or you can then just make it your own or you can just< just follow it as much as you want okay just follow it as much as you want okay so< so here's a trade update so so here's a trade update so unfortunately< unfortunately as you can see Google has unfortunately as you can see Google has continued< continued to go lower as with the whole continued to go lower as with the whole broad< broad Market in general basically the broad Market in general basically the market< market has been selling off relentlessly market has been selling off relentlessly and< and basically all the tech stocks have and basically all the tech stocks have been< been just going down right so I'm been just going down right so I'm fortunately< fortunately uh Google has continued to fortunately uh Google has continued to go< go down and went below our short put go down and went below our. short put strike< strike at $100 but the good news is that strike at $100 but the good news is that we've< we've already planned it out right so in we've already planned it out right so in a< a sense this is a good case study a sense this is a good case study because< because if everything was to just work because if everything was to just work out< out fine you would never know what to do out fine you would never know what to do if< if you know the things does not work out if you know the things does not work out right< right so this is a very good case study right so this is a very good case study as< as you can see so the thing is that we as you can see so the thing is that we have< have already planned for this in advance have already planned for this in advance right< right so we already planned for this in right so we already planned for this in scenario< scenario 2 as you can see that if Google scenario 2 as you can see that if Google goes< goes below below $100 so if it's below goes below below $100 so if it's below our< our break even price but above our break even price but above $864< $864 we have already planned out what to $864 we have already planned out what to do< do so it did not touch $86 45 so we do do so it did not touch $86 45 so we do not< not cut loss so at this point of time not cut loss so at this point of time there< there is 21 days left on the expiration there is 21 days left on the expiration so< so this is not what we do all right so so this is not what we do all right so right< right now what we can do according to right now what we can do according to our< our plan is to roll so that's what I did our plan is to roll so that's what I did so< so according to the planning scenario 2 so according to the planning scenario 2 what< what I did is I rot my short put out and what I did is I rot my short put out and down< down from a $100 strike to $97 so I down from a $100 strike to $97 so I moved< moved $3 down and I was able to receive moved $3 down and I was able to receive a< a credit for 27 Cent so I roll from 21 a credit for 27 Cent so I roll from 21 DTE< DTE and the new uh expiration cycle the DTE and the new uh expiration cycle the new< new monthly expiration cycle I think is new monthly expiration cycle I think is about< about 52 about 52 DTE< DTE so there's 52 days left so with this DTE so there's 52 days left so with this I< I lowered my Breck even as well so you I lowered my Breck even as well so you can< can see that the total credit which I uh can see that the total credit which I uh receive< receive will be $241 which is the receive will be $241 which is the original< original credit plus this uh credit original credit plus this uh credit which< which I roll I get $26 which I roll I get $26 and< and the new Break Even will be at and the new Break Even will be at $94.

31< $94. 31 so it is down here so at this $94.

31 so it is down here so at this point< point in time the good news is that it point in time the good news is that it has< has not gone below my break event price has not gone below my break event price although< although it does seem that in the next although it does seem that in the next few< few days it could go below but no few days it could go below but no problem< problem as well because we will have a problem as well because we will have a game< game plan for this so the game plan here game plan for this so the game plan here is< is that if Google continues going down is that if Google continues going down we< we will cut loss at a Max loss of around we will cut loss at a Max loss of around $1,215< $1,215 now this does not change right so $1,215 now this does not change right so whenever< whenever you're trading this and you're whenever you're trading this and you're not< not planning to get filled on the stock not planning to get filled on the stock right< right you must always have a cut loss right you must always have a cut loss point< point so this cut loss points I already point so this cut loss points I already mentioned< mentioned earlier will be the margin mentioned earlier will be the margin which< which I put up for this so which is which I put up for this so which is around< around $1,200 you do not want to around $1,200 you do not want to increase< increase this just because you know you increase this just because you know you have< have a hope of the market going back up have a hope of the market going back up so< so as long as Google continues to go so as long as Google continues to go down< down and I start to see a loss of 1,200 down and I start to see a loss of 1,200 around< around there I'm going to cut loss right around there I'm going to cut loss right if< if Google goes up I'm going to take if Google goes up I'm going to take profit< profit at 50% of the original credit profit at 50% of the original credit which< which is $241 which uh what's the which is $241 which uh what's the original< original credit and then if the days to original credit and then if the days to expiration< expiration left let's say it stays expiration left let's say it stays between< between the new uh cut off point of between the new uh cut off point of $1,250< $1,250 the max loss and the short putut $1,250 the max loss and the short putut strike< strike what I'm going to do is I'm going strike what I'm going to do is I'm going to< to just roll it right so I'm going to do to just roll it right so I'm going to do another< another row at 31 to 30 days DTE so at another row at 31 to 30 days DTE so at this< this point of time I roughly have about this point of time I roughly have about 30< 30 days left so let's just see how the 30 days left so let's just see how the trade< trade will plan out right so it might trade will plan out right so it might just< just go back down and as you can see just go back down and as you can see Market< Market is pretty overs right now so Market is pretty overs right now so hopefully< hopefully there is a bounce although we hopefully there is a bounce although we never< never know what's going to happen in never know what's going to happen in this< this market condition right it could this market condition right it could just< just continue to go lower right if it just continue to go lower right if it really< really hits my cut loss point I have to really hits my cut loss point I have to cut< cut loss according to my plan so that's cut loss according to my plan so that's why< why a plan is very important I've why a plan is very important I've actually< actually spoken to a number of my actually spoken to a number of my subscribers< subscribers and many of them have told subscribers and many of them have told me< me you know now that their shut is so me you know now that their shut is so deep< deep in the money what. do they do right deep in the money what do they do right what< what can they do so if you have already what can they do so if you have already reached< reached a point where you have no idea reached a point where you have no idea what< what to do it just means that you did what to do it just means that you did not< not plan for the worst case scenario not plan for the worst case scenario right< right you do not have a proper planning right you do not have a proper planning of< of all the scenarios that can happen and of all the scenarios that can happen and then< then you execute according to them so then you execute according to them so whenever< whenever you enter a trade the most whenever you enter a trade the most important< important thing is to always have a game important thing is to always have a game plan< plan a complete game plan that means you plan a complete game plan that means you plan< plan out for all the different scenarios plan out for all the different scenarios as< as I have here right especially when the as I have here right especially when the trade< trade does not work out well so that is trade does not work out well so that is the< the most important time where you really the most important time where you really need< need to know what to do because if you need to know what to do because if you just< just let one trade lose so much money just let one trade lose so much money and< and lose basically most of your account and lose basically most of your account account< account it's going to be very hard for account it's going to be very hard for you< you to fight back so for me a loss of you to fight back so for me a loss of 1,200< 1,200 is actually small considering uh 1,200 is actually small considering uh my< my account size so this way I can always my account size so this way I can always have< have more trades later on to fight back have more trades later on to fight back right< right so this is also very important for right so this is also very important for you< you to do so this is my new game plan uh you to do so this is my new game plan uh as< as you can see it's important for you to as you can see it's important for you to have< have a game plan as well I hope you what have a game plan as well I hope you what you< you really can take out of this is not you really can take out of this is not just< just to plan out so that your trade wins just to plan out so that your trade wins and< and then you do not do you know much and then you do not do you know much about< about it but rather to plan it out so about it but rather to plan it out so that< that the if the worst case scenario that the if the worst case scenario happens< happens which right now any long happens which right now any long position< position which you have most likely position which you have most likely could< could be hit as the market is going to could be hit as the market is going to uh< uh continue its Relentless selling right uh continue its Relentless selling right the< the most important thing is that your the most important thing is that your plan< plan has laid out everything so you know plan has laid out everything so you know what< what to do and you cut off the max loss what to do and you cut off the max loss as< as you have laid out in your plan if it as you have laid out in your plan if it does< does reach it all right guys so I hope does reach it all right guys so I hope this< this video has been helpful for you and this video has been helpful for you and if< if it has I appreciate if you give me a if it has I appreciate if you give me a thumbs< thumbs up and

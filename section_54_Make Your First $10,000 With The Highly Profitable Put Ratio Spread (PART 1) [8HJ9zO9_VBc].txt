### Make Your First $10,000 With The Highly Profitable Put Ratio Spread (PART 1) [8HJ9zO9_VBc]
==============================================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about how you we're going to be talking about how you can< can make your first ten thousand dollars can make your first ten thousand dollars with< with the highly profitable put ratio with the highly profitable put ratio spread< spread and the reason is because in my spread and the reason is because in my previous< previous video where I talked about the previous video where I talked about the number< number one secret to becoming number one secret to becoming consistently< consistently profitable trading options consistently profitable trading options I< I shared this put ratio spread uh I shared this put ratio spread uh spreadsheet< spreadsheet of my trades where I did it spreadsheet of my trades where I did it for< for about a year and after I shared this for about a year and after I shared this I< I got a number of people that reached I got a number of people that reached out< out to me and they are very interested out to me and they are very interested to< to find out how to put on the put ratio to find out how to put on the put ratio spread< spread for themselves as well so in this spread for themselves as well so in this video< video I'm going to go a little bit more video I'm going to go a little bit more in< in depth share with you you know what in depth share with you you know what the< the things to look out for and also how the things to look out for and also how to< to construct it and put on the trades to construct it and put on the trades for< for yourself all right so first things for yourself all right so first things first< first what is the put ratio spread if first what is the put ratio spread if you're< you're not very familiar with what this you're not very familiar with what this is< is well first of all the pre-racial is well first of all the pre-racial spread< spread is a neutral to bullish strategy spread is a neutral to bullish strategy that< that has a very high probability right that has a very high probability right so< so if you set it up the right way and so if you set it up the right way and the< the way that I'm going to share with you the way that I'm going to share with you you're< you're going to have more than 80 you're going to have more than 80 percent< percent probability of profit right so percent probability of profit right so the< the poor ratio spread is the combination the poor ratio spread is the combination of< of two things right the way you want to of two things right the way you want to look< look at it is that it is a short put look at it is that it is a short put and< and a long put spread so basically you and a long put spread so basically you receive< receive a credit for the shot put all receive a credit for the shot put all right< right and then with this credit you use right and then with this credit you use it< it to finance the long put spread so it to finance the long put spread so ideally< ideally we want the shot put credit to ideally we want the shot put credit to be< be more than the bear put spread debit be more than the bear put spread debit right< right the bad push price basically the right the bad push price basically the long< long put spread so as you can see down long put spread so as you can see down here< here the shot put down here you will here the shot put down here you will receive< receive let's say for example you receive let's say for example you receive< receive a credit of two dollars 44 cents receive a credit of two dollars 44 cents then< then you want the long put spread to be then you want the long put spread to be less< less than this number right anything less than this number right anything that< that is less than this this overall that is less than this this overall spread< spread will be a credit so in this case. spread will be a credit so in this case I< I chose uh this uh strike so in this I chose uh this uh strike so in this case< case you can see that the debit for this case you can see that the debit for this long< long put spread is lesser than the long put spread is lesser than the credit< credit which we receive for the shot put credit which we receive for the shot put so< so overall this will result in a credit so overall this will result in a credit so< so the shot put or rather the put ratio so the shot put or rather the put ratio spread< spread is a credit spread now if you spread is a credit spread now if you were< were to take a look at the chart you were to take a look at the chart you will< will see it visually that it basically will see it visually that it basically looks< looks like this right so you have one looks like this right so you have one long< long put and then you have two shot put long put and then you have two shot put and< and usually for the put ratio spread the and usually for the put ratio spread the two< two short strikes or rather the two shot two short strikes or rather the two shot put< put is at the same strike so if you can put is at the same strike so if you can see< see this previous slide down here you see this previous slide down here you can< can see that both the shot put all right can see that both the shot put all right you< you have the shot put in the debit you have the shot put in the debit spread< spread the put spread and the shot put spread the put spread and the shot put they< they are both the same strike so that is they are both the same strike so that is why< why you will see it on your chart most why you will see it on your chart most of< of the time that there is two short puts of the time that there is two short puts at< at one area and then one long put so you at one area and then one long put so you just< just have to think of this as an just have to think of this as an embedded< embedded long put spread with an embedded long put spread with an additional< additional short put right so I most of additional short put right so I most of the< the time when you put on the put ratio the time when you put on the put ratio spread< spread it will be below the market spread it will be below the market because< because again this is a neutral to because again this is a neutral to bullish< bullish strategy so in this way anything bullish strategy so in this way anything that< that is above the long put spread will that is above the long put spread will still< still be a profit because remember you still be a profit because remember you receive< receive a credit Upfront for putting on receive a credit Upfront for putting on the< the spread so if the market goes all the the spread so if the market goes all the way< way to the Moon way to the Moon right< right you still at least receive the right you still at least receive the minimum< minimum profit which is the credit which minimum profit which is the credit which you< you receive for selling this put spread you receive for selling this put spread and< and your max profit will be basically and your max profit will be basically from< from this point from this point of< of your loan put spread all the way to of your loan put spread all the way to the< the other end and I'll show you more in the other end and I'll show you more in the< the risk profile over here so as you can the risk profile over here so as you can see< see over here this is the risk profile see over here this is the risk profile of< of the put ratio spread of the put ratio spread so< so you can see that there are two short so you can see that there are two short puts< puts at 182. 5 so this is the mark down puts at 182.

5 so this is the mark down here< here one at 2. 5 this is where your shot here one at 2.

5 this is where your shot put< put is and where your long put is put is and where your long put. is the< the beginning of your put spread is down the beginning of your put spread is down here here here 187. 5< 187.

5 right so this is where it creates 187. 5 right so this is where it creates this< this like 10 shape kind of uh thing down this like 10 shape kind of uh thing down here< here a 10 ship where your max profit is here a 10 ship where your max profit is in< in this zone so this is where the in this zone so this is where the current<. current market is right now so anything current market is right now so anything above< above there right you would just receive above there right you would just receive the< the minimum profit which is the credit the minimum profit which is the credit you< you receive for selling it so in this you receive for selling it so in this case< case it's 1.

5 which is 105 but the case it's 1. 5 which is 105 but the maximum< maximum profit can be above 500 because maximum profit can be above 500 because your< your. long put spread has a width of five your long put spread has a width of five dollars< dollars you can see from 187.

5 to 182. 5 dollars you can see from 187.

5 to 182. 5 that< that is a width of five dollars that that is a width of five dollars that means< means that's 500 and then the maximum means that's 500 and then the maximum profit< profit will also include the credit profit will also include the credit which< which you receive at the start right so which you receive at the start right so you< you receive five hundred dollars plus you receive five hundred dollars plus the< the credit which is total of six hundred the credit which is total of six hundred and< and five dollars if you manage to pin and five dollars if you manage to pin the< the strike at expiration for the put the strike at expiration for the put ratio< ratio spread so ideally you want the ratio spread so ideally you want the market< market to be down here so imagine this market to be down here so imagine this is< is Mr Market all right so Mr Market is is Mr Market all right so Mr Market is down< down here so what you want him to do is down here so what you want him to do is that< that you idly want him to come to this that you idly want him to come to this beautiful< beautiful tent of yours right so imagine beautiful tent of yours right so imagine this< this is like your home right you have a this is like your home right you have a nice< nice door down here what you want to do nice door down here what you want to do is< is when you see Mr Market you want to is when you see Mr Market you want to tell< tell him hey man I've got a really tell him hey man I've got a really beautiful< beautiful house here do come in take a beautiful house here do come in take a look< look and you want him to stay in this look and you want him to stay in this house< house for as long as possible until house for as long as possible until expiration< expiration that's how you get the max expiration that's how you get the max profit< profit down here but as much as possible profit down here but as much as possible you< you do not want him to go out the back you do not want him to go out the back door< door all right as you can see you see door all right as you can see you see this< this red line down here this is where this red line down here this is where your< your Breakeven price is so that means your Breakeven price is so that means anything< anything past this point you're gonna anything past this point you're gonna start< start losing money as you can see as the start losing money as you can see as the market< market goes further down it's going to market goes further down it's going to lose< lose even more money so this is the back lose even more money so this is the back door< door down here as much as possible you door down here as much as possible you do< do not want to miss the market to go out do not want to miss the market to go out this< this back door because this is your your this back door because this is your your backyard< backyard right your backyard you're backyard right your backyard you're gonna< gonna have all sorts of uh you're all gonna have all sorts of uh you're all your< your little dirty secrets maybe you know your little dirty secrets maybe you know maybe< maybe you have your excess. stuff right maybe you have your excess stuff right all< all your extra stuff or maybe you know all your extra stuff or maybe you know you< you have some skeletons skeleton in your you have some skeletons skeleton in your in< in your closet and you know that's in your closet and you know that's basically< basically the place that you do not want basically the place that you do not want Mr< Mr Market to go to because this is the Mr Market to go to because this is the graveyard< graveyard right the graveyard not for graveyard right the graveyard not for him< him but for you especially you can see him but for you especially you can see this< this is a steep slope right you this is a steep slope right you definitely< definitely do not want him to get out definitely do not want him to get out the< the door and then he's going to fall the door and then he's going to fall down< down the slope so what do you do if Mr down the slope so what do you do if Mr Market< Market happened to go all the way down Market happened to go all the way down here< here right he imagine he came to your here right he imagine he came to your house< house he's liking it then he got a house he's liking it then he got a little< little bit curious and he sees this door little bit curious and he sees this door down< down here right and he wants to go out down here right and he wants to go out so< so at this point what he do this is so at this point what he do this is where< where you want to distract him and tell where you want to distract him and tell him< him say hey hey man check out the new him say hey hey man check out the new lawnmower< lawnmower that you bought all right for lawnmower that you bought all right for your< your front garden so all this part down your front garden so all this part down here< here all the way to the front is the here all the way to the front is the front< front garden tell him say that you know front garden tell him say that you know you< you can play with the lawnmower just do you can play with the lawnmower just do not< not go out the the back door or maybe not go out the the back door or maybe just< just distract him telling him that hey just distract him telling him that hey you< you got a type of rare flower that you got a type of rare flower that you're< you're growing I seem to come and take a you're growing I seem to come and take a look< look right so basically what you want look right so basically what you want him< him to do is him to do is just< just stay around this point down here do just stay around this point down here do not< not go to the back door and in fact not go to the back door and in fact actually< actually for him to go all the way back actually for him to go all the way back there< there it's not that easy because if you there it's not that easy because if you can< can take a look at the probability here can take a look at the probability here you< you can see that the probability of you can see that the probability of profit< profit is more than 80 percent profit is more than 80 percent 88.

69< 88. 69 if you set this right so this 88.

69 if you set this right so this comes< comes down also to where you place your comes down also to where you place your shot< shot put at right the the additional shot put at right the the additional shot< shot put shot put on< on top of your long put spread so on top of your long put spread so basically< basically this point this stride is basically this point this stride is where< where you want to place it at the where you want to place it at the expected< expected move right so I explained this expected move right so I explained this in< in detail in my previous video If you in detail in my previous video If you haven't< haven't uh seen the video yet go ahead haven't uh seen the video yet go ahead and< and watch that first so that is how you and watch that first so that is how you can< can set up the put ratio spread with a can set up the put ratio spread with a high< high probability of profit right so if high probability of profit right so if you< you were to take a look at the chart for you were to take a look at the chart for a< a visual representation you can see that a visual representation you can see that this< this is how it looks like right so this is how it looks like right so basically< basically the put ratio spread can be basically the put ratio spread can be divided< divided into three different zones right divided into three different zones right you< you have the the top Zone down here you have the the top Zone down here basically< basically this is where your minimum basically this is where your minimum profit< profit is is anything above this long profit is is anything above this long put< put strike which you have for the put put strike which you have for the put ratio< ratio spread this is your credit which ratio spread this is your credit which you< you receive when you sold the put ratio you receive when you sold the put ratio spread< spread and then down here this is where spread and then down here this is where your< your tent is right so if you remember your tent is right so if you remember and< and you recall down here this is where and you recall down here this is where your< your tent is anything above here this is your tent is anything above here this is the< the minimum credit and down here is your the minimum credit and down here is your graveyard< graveyard which you do not want Mr graveyard which you do not want Mr Market< Market to visit so if I were to just Market to visit so if I were to just draw< draw it on the chart down here you can draw it on the chart down here you can see< see this is how it would basically look see this is how it would basically look like< like right so you have your tent here like right so you have your tent here and< and then at this point this is where the and then at this point this is where the graveyard< graveyard will start to come right so graveyard will start to come right so anything< anything above this point so this is anything above this point so this is basically< basically the the zero profit line basically the the zero profit line all< all right so if I would draw it all the all right so if I would draw it all the way< way to the bottom so you can see it so way to the bottom so you can see it so basically< basically as long as the market stays basically as long as the market stays above< above this point by expiration you will above this point by expiration you will be< be all in profit all right so this is be all in profit all right so this is the< the maximum profit Zone which is ideally the maximum profit Zone which is ideally where< where you want the price to go to near where you want the price to go to near expiration< expiration this is where you want. to expiration this is where you want to catch< catch it all right I call this a big catch it all right I call this a big catchment< catchment area your tent and anything catchment area your tent and anything past< past that will be a loss so you can past that will be a loss so you can really< really see this on the chart you can see really see this on the chart you can see that< that actually it is a very big range of that actually it is a very big range of profit< profit and for the market to really go profit and for the market to really go past< past this point is a very low past this point is a very low probability< probability again as you can see we set probability again as you can see we set up< up probably the probability is less than up probably the probability is less than 11< 11 and if you recall the previous video 11 and if you recall the previous video which< which I did regarding the expected move which I did regarding the expected move you< you will know that this number actually you will know that this number actually can< can be higher when it comes to can be higher when it comes to practicality< practicality rise right because practicality rise right because empirically< empirically the in the past the employee empirically the in the past the employee volatility< volatility always overstates the actual volatility always overstates the actual move< move so this is all based on the implied move so this is all based on the implied volatility< volatility and if history repeats itself volatility and if history repeats itself which< which more often than not it does then which more often than not it does then the< the probability of it staying in this the probability of it staying in this Zone< Zone will usually be higher all right Zone will usually be higher all right okay< okay so the next thing you want to okay so the next thing you want to understand< understand is that the put ratio spread understand is that the put ratio spread is< is actually very flexible right so a is actually very flexible right so a number< number of people have asked regarding number of people have asked regarding the< the embedded put spread right the long the embedded put spread right the long put< put spread where do we buy the long put spread where do we buy the long strikes< strikes or the long put spread where do strikes or the long put spread where do you put< you put it well the thing is that this you put it well the thing is that this is< is very flexible right so in this is very flexible right so in this example< example you can see that there are two example you can see that there are two puts< puts strikes down here and then one long puts strikes down here and then one long put< put down here but actually you can put down here but actually you can manipulate< manipulate the strikes right you can manipulate the strikes right you can have< have the long put slightly higher and have the long put slightly higher and then< then this additional one put we bring it then this additional one put we bring it up< up here so that the long pull spread up here so that the long pull spread will< will be here will be here and< and then you have your shot put spread and then you have your shot put spread down< down here still as well you can just down here still as well you can just keep< keep keep changing it or you could have keep keep changing it or you could have actually< actually a smaller tent right so that actually a smaller tent right so that means< means your debit spread is not as wide means your debit spread is not as wide so< so let's say for example in this uh risk so let's say for example in this uh risk profile< profile down here you can see that the profile down here you can see that the width< width of this long put spread is only width of this long put spread is only 2. 5< 2.

#### Topic 1

5 points wide right so only two 2. 5 points wide right so only two dollars< dollars fifty cents wide and you're dollars fifty cents wide and you're receiving< receiving more credit so if you take a receiving more credit so if you take a look< look at the previous example look at the previous example you< you can see for this example there is a you can see for this example there is a five< five dollars wide spread all right this five dollars wide spread all right this is< is five dollars and that is why your is five dollars and that is why your tenth< tenth right your profit is about 500 tenth right your profit is about 500 plus< plus plus the credit and your credit plus plus the credit and your credit. which< which you receive is a dollar five cents which you receive is a dollar five cents but< but in this example you can see that you but in this example you can see that you have< have four go on the bigger or rather the have four go on the bigger or rather the larger< larger width uh long put spread so that larger width uh long put spread so that you< you can get a higher credit up front so you can get a higher credit up front so in< in a sense you're sacrificing two in a sense you're sacrificing two dollars< dollars and fifty cents right in dollars and fifty cents right in potential< potential Max profit potential Max profit for< for a guaranteed additional 0.

6 how many for a guaranteed additional 0. 6 how many how< how much is that this is. o5 so how much is that this is o5 so 0.

60. 60< 0.

60. 60 cents which is 60 dollars 0.

60. 60 cents which is 60 dollars in< in additional credit right so this is in additional credit right so this is guaranteed< guaranteed that you get when you sell it guaranteed that you get when you sell it right< right when you sell it you will get this right when you sell it you will get this uh< uh money and then of course everything uh money and then of course everything will< will be calculated upon expiration to will be calculated upon expiration to see< see whether or not you get to keep the see whether or not you get to keep the sixty< sixty dollars so this is a trade-off sixty dollars so this is a trade-off down< down here do you prefer to have a lower down here do you prefer to have a lower credit< credit upfront but have a higher credit upfront but have a higher potential< potential profit from this point to here potential profit from this point to here or< or do you prefer to have a higher credit or do you prefer to have a higher credit up< up front and then have a lower potential up front and then have a lower potential Max< Max profit so which one is better the Max profit so which one is better the answer< answer is that there's none that is answer is that there's none that is better< better because you have no idea what Mr better because you have no idea what Mr Market< Market is going to do right because all Market is going to do right because all this< this is all in hindsight if Mr Market this is all in hindsight if Mr Market was< was to stay down here at expiration all was to stay down here at expiration all right< right or along this long planes then of right or along this long planes then of course< course this. uh version of the put ratio course this uh version of the put ratio spread< spread would be better because you'll be spread would be better because you'll be making< making much more from the credit which making much more from the credit which you< you receive but if Mr Market was to you receive but if Mr Market was to actually< actually go down and then stay there at actually go down and then stay there at X< X expression then this will actually X expression then this will actually make< make more for you because he would be make more for you because he would be inside< inside this tent where you would be able inside this tent where you would be able to< to make to make potentially< potentially the max profit of this test potentially the max profit of this test so< so again this all comes down to your so again this all comes down to your view< view on the market view on the market so< so there's another way that you can do so there's another way that you can do it< it so in this case let's say you want to it so in this case let's say you want to have< have a bigger Max potential profit as have a bigger Max potential profit as you< you can see down here this is much you can see down here this is much bigger< bigger and higher than the previous one bigger and higher than the previous one so< so what's happening down here is that so what's happening down here is that you're< you're fall going more upfront credit so you're fall going more upfront credit so that< that you can get a bigger Max potential that you can get a bigger Max potential profit< profit down here so in this case this is profit down here so in this case this is 7.

5 7. 5 7.

5 7. 50< 7.

50 which is a Max profit potential Max 7. 50 which is a Max profit potential Max profit< profit of 750 versus this uh thirty profit of 750 versus this uh thirty dollars< dollars credit which you will receive so dollars credit which you will receive so in< in this case you can see there are in this case you can see there are trade-offs< trade-offs down here there is no one trade-offs down here there is no one that< that is better than the other it comes that is better than the other it comes down< down again to where you think the market down again to where you think the market might< might be going all right so you can see might be going all right so you can see there's< there's all a balance so in this case there's all a balance so in this case. this< this is uh more upfront credit this is this is uh more upfront credit this is more< more balanced and then this one is much more balanced and then this one is much more< more defensive where you feel that the more defensive where you feel that the market< market right Mr Market might have a market right Mr Market might have a chance< chance that it will go lower so one chance that it will go lower so one thing< thing to also note is the break-even thing to also note is the break-even point< point all right so if you notice for point all right so if you notice for this< this the break-even point is much lower this the break-even point is much lower this< this break even is at this break even is at 174.

67< 174. 67 that is why you can see that the 174.

#### Topic 2

67 that is why you can see that the the< the probability of profit is much higher the probability of profit is. much higher down< down here you can see the probability of down here you can see the probability of profit< profit is 90. 93 whereas in the previous profit is 90.

93 whereas in the previous example example example all< all right let me just remove this this all right let me just remove. this this previous< previous example you can see that the previous example you can see that the probability< probability profit is only 85. 93 and you probability profit is only 85.

93 and you can< can see that the break-even point down can see that the break-even. point down here< here is much lesser this is here is much lesser this is 178. 35< 178.

35 sorry the breaking point is 178. 35 sorry the breaking point is higher higher higher 178.

35< 178. 35 versus 178.

35 versus 174. 67< 174.

67 so in a sense in this case it's 174. 67 so in a sense in this case it's much< much uh lesser chance for you to lose much uh lesser chance for you to lose money< money compared to this down here money compared to this down here right< right where there's a higher probability right. where there's a higher probability of< of losing but over here you get a higher of losing but over here you get a higher probability< probability of making the profits right probability of making the profits right which< which is much more which is much more 1.

65< 1. 65 cents versus 30 cents all right so 1.

65 cents versus 30 cents all right so again< again there are trade-offs down here now again there are trade-offs down here now the< the other way you can construct the put the other way you can construct the put ratio< ratio spread is by changing up the ratio spread is by changing up the strikes< strikes of your long put spreads all strikes of your long put spreads all right< right so in the previous example you can right so in the previous example you can see< see that the short strikes the shot puts see that the short strikes the shot puts are< are all at the same strike so that is are all at the same strike so that is why< why you have this 10 ship here right why you have this 10 ship here right this< this is like a a sharp cone a pyramid this is like a a sharp cone a pyramid shape< shape but when you come to this example shape but when you come to this example down< down here you can see that it's slightly down here you can see that it's slightly flat< flat at the top that is because right flat at the top that is because right now< now your shot put is down here you have now your shot put is down here you have one< one shot put down here but then the one shot put down here but then the other< other shot put is over here all right other shot put is over here all right you've< you've got one shot put here one shot you've got one shot put here one shot put< put and then your long put spread uh put and then your long put spread uh sorry< sorry your long put is over here so that sorry your long put is over here so that is< is why you do not have this sharp cone is why you do not have this sharp cone so< so what this actually does compared to so what this actually does compared to this< this is that you are actually widening this is. that you are actually widening your< your profit zone or rather you're your profit zone or rather you're widening< widening your max profit Zone if you widening your max profit Zone if you compare< compare to this you can see that the compare to this you can see that the zone< zone for the max profit is very small zone for the max profit is very small but< but then again because of uh the strikes but then again because of uh the strikes this< this long put spread down here let me this long put spread down here let me just< just remove all these uh drawings again just remove all these uh drawings again because< because all this long put spread because all this long put spread this< this long put spread down here is much this long put spread down here is much closer< closer this long put spread down here is closer this long put spread down here is much< much closer to where the current market much closer to where the current market is< is so as long as you keep pushing your is so as long as you keep pushing your long< long put spread closer and closer to long put spread closer and closer to where< where the current market price is it where the current market price is it will< will get more and more expensive right will get more and more expensive right so< so your long pushback will get more so your long pushback will get more expensive< expensive and that means that the credit expensive and that means that the credit which< which you receive will be much lesser which you receive will be much lesser right< right so let's say if I were to see in right so let's say if I were to see in this< this next example you can see the credit this next example you can see the credit becomes< becomes even lesser because right now I becomes even lesser because right now I have< have the long put spread the long put have the long put spread the long put starting< starting from 192. 5 right in this starting from 192.

#### Topic 3

5 right in this example< example I had it at 190. so what you're example I had it at 190.

so what you're doing< doing is that you're giving up more doing is that you're giving up more upfront< upfront credit all right your upfront upfront credit all right your upfront credit< credit has been lesser by about 20 30 25 credit has been lesser by about 20 30 25 cents< cents but then you are getting a larger cents but then you are getting a larger profit< profit Zone compared to this one down profit Zone compared to this one down here< here where it's slightly narrower so here where it's slightly narrower so again< again it's a kind of a trade-off of again it's a kind of a trade-off of where< where you see the profit where the where you see the profit where the market< market is going to go so again one thing market is going to go so again one thing you< you want to take note whenever you're you want to take note whenever you're constructing< constructing this put ratio spread is constructing this put ratio spread is the< the probability profit and where your the probability profit and where your Breakeven< Breakeven price is so these are the Breakeven price is so these are the things< things that you want to take turn off things that you want to take turn off when< when you're constructing it so this is when you're constructing it so this is where< where you can suit it to your view of where you can suit it to your view of the< the market if you are very very bearish the market if you are very very bearish you< you think that the market is going to go you think that the market is going to go down< down then you want to create the put down then you want to create the put ratio< ratio spread where you have the highest ratio spread where you have the highest Max< Max potential profit at the lower point Max. potential profit at the lower point and< and lesser credit up front so this way and lesser credit up front so this way the< the right you have a bigger room to the right you have a bigger room to catch< catch where the market might be going at catch where the market might be going at expiration< expiration right so this you have a very expiration right so this you have a very large< large profit Zone or rather a very high large profit Zone or rather a very high probability< probability of profit compared right to probability of profit compared right to your< your loss and then compared to this you your loss and then compared to this you can< can see this has a much lesser lower can see this has a much lesser lower probability< probability of profit but you have a probability of profit but you have a pretty< pretty nice and wide profit Zone as well pretty nice and wide profit Zone as well and< and for this and for this you< you can see although you are defensive you can see although you are defensive you're< you're defensive in a way whereby as you're defensive in a way whereby as long< long as the market just drops a little long as the market just drops a little bit< bit you want to have the chance for it bit you want to have the chance for it to< to enter this large profit Zone all to enter this large profit Zone all right< right compared to this tent it has to go right compared to this tent it has to go much< much further you have to go to 190 much further you have to go to 190 before< before it can start to actually enter before it can start to actually enter into< into this wide profit Zone into this wide profit Zone for< for this all let's do is go to 192. 5 for for this all let's do is go to 192.

Language: en hey< hey guys i've got a quick question for hey guys i've got a quick question for you< you today so this is the stock of disney you today so this is the stock of disney and< and as you can see it has dropped quite and as you can see it has dropped quite a< a bit so at this time you might be a bit so at this time you might be thinking< thinking to yourself let's just imagine thinking to yourself let's just imagine that< that you want to buy a hundred shares of that you want to buy a hundred shares of this< this stock you think that you know 102 this stock you think that you know 102 and< and 72 cents this is a good place for and 72 cents this is a good place for you< you to buy and you're looking to buy 100 you to buy and you're looking to buy 100 shares< shares so there are two ways you can go shares so there are two ways you can go about< about buying this shares right so option about buying this shares right so option a< a would be to just simply pay 10 272 a would be to just simply pay 10 272 for< for 100 shares all right for 100 shares all right now< now the second option would be to pay now the second option would be to pay 5490< 5490 for 100 shares now if it was you 5490 for 100 shares now if it was you which< which would you choose which would you choose now< now you might be thinking to yourself is now you might be thinking to yourself is this< this a trick question right obviously we this a trick question right obviously we would< would want to just buy would want to just buy 5< 5 000 i mean just pay five thousand four 5 000 i mean just pay five thousand four hundred< hundred ninety dollars for the shares hundred ninety dollars for the shares right< right why would i want to pay more when right why would i want to pay more when i< i can pay less i can pay less and and and this< this is the thing this is the thing a< a lot of people a lot of people do< do not realize that there is an option b do not realize that there is an option b okay< okay they thought that the only way that okay they thought that the only way that they< they can buy you know the shares 100 they can buy you know the shares 100 shares< shares would be to buy uh just pay shares would be to buy uh just pay outright< outright you. know 400 shares pay 10 272 outright you know 400 shares pay 10 272 when< when there is in fact this other option when there is in fact this other option and< and this other options is by using leaps and this other options is by using leaps options< options and leaps call options very options and leaps call options very specifically< specifically so this video i'm going to specifically so this video i'm going to talk< talk all about the difference between talk all about the difference between stocks< stocks versus leaps and give you a much stocks versus leaps and give you a much more< more informed decision which is better more informed decision which is better for< for you okay so for you okay so if< if you ever watched if you ever watched the< the leaves video which i've already the leaves video which i've already created created created before< before which i've already gone in depth before which i've already gone in depth into< into what leaps is into what leaps is you< you can click it at the top right hand you can click it at the top right hand corner< corner there'll be a link somewhere corner there'll be a link somewhere there< there but for this video i want to there but for this video i want to specifically< specifically talk about the intrinsic specifically talk about the intrinsic value< value and the extrinsic value because value and the extrinsic value because that's< that's the main difference between that's the main difference between stocks< stocks and leaps right so stocks are 100 stocks and leaps right so stocks are 100 intrinsic< intrinsic value there's no extrinsic intrinsic value there's no extrinsic value< value at all but for leaps you have a value at all but for leaps you have a mix< mix of intrinsic and extrinsic value and mix of intrinsic and extrinsic value and very< very quickly extrinsic value is just very quickly extrinsic value is just basically< basically time value right time value uh basically time value right time value uh it< it decays over time that means as the it decays over time that means as the option< option expiration date goes to zero all option expiration date goes to zero all this< this extrinsic value will disappear okay this extrinsic value will disappear okay so< so if you take a look at this option so if you take a look at this option chain< chain down here of disney chain down here of disney all right< all right first of all i want you to all right first of all i want you to take< take a note to take notice off is the take a note to take notice off is the price< price is actually 102. 60 this is the price is actually 102.

60 this is the last< last trader but we don't want to see last trader but we don't want to see this< this because right now if you go to the. this because right now if you go to the market< market and you hit the ask you can buy market and you hit the ask you can buy for< for 102. 60 for 102.

60 so< so next thing i want you to take a look so next thing i want you to take a look at< at is this intrinsic and extrinsic box at is this intrinsic and extrinsic box down< down here so you can see down here there down here so you can see down here there are< are two columns are two columns on< on the left hand side is the intrinsic on the left hand side is the intrinsic column< column on the right hand side. is column on the right hand side is extrinsic< extrinsic column so intrinsic column extrinsic column so intrinsic column very< very simply it's just the difference very simply it's just the difference between< between the uh current market price and between the uh current market price and the< the strike price so if i was to take 102 the strike price so if i was to take 102 60< 60 cents minus off the strike you will 60 cents minus off the strike you will get< get 52. 6 get 52.

6 right< right extrinsic value on the other hand right extrinsic value on the other hand is< is dependent on the volatility as well is dependent on the volatility as well as< as how much time that is left in the as how much time that is left in the option< option okay so that's what you need to option okay so that's what you need to know< know for intrinsic value and extrinsic know for intrinsic value and extrinsic failure< failure so now. let's talk about failure so now let's talk about what< what if the stock goes up right the what if the stock goes up right the underlying< underlying stock goes up how much does underlying stock goes up how much does buying< buying shares make and how much does buying shares make and how much does leaps< leaps make leaps make so< so let's say if disney goes from 102 so let's say if disney goes from 102 60< 60 cents to 22 122. 60 60 cents to 22 122.

60 what< what is the profit for stock so for what is the profit for stock so for stocks< stocks very straightforward we have a 20 stocks very straightforward we have a 20 profit< profit and then to calculate. the return profit and then to calculate the return it's< it's just you take 20 you divided by the it's just you take 20 you divided by the cost< cost per share cost per share and< and you get 19. 49 which is not bad which and you get 19.

49 which is not bad which is< is pretty decent right what about for is pretty decent right what about for leaps leaps leaps so< so for leaps so for leaps how< how do we calculate the profit so how do we calculate the profit so basically< basically a rough gauge is by taking a basically a rough gauge is by taking a look< look at delta right if you're not very look at delta right if you're not very familiar< familiar on what delta is by now delta familiar on what delta is by now delta just< just basically measures the options just basically measures the options value< value the rate of the change in the value the rate of the change in the options< options value per one dollar move in the options value per. one dollar move in the underlying< underlying stock so if the underlying underlying stock so if the underlying stock< stock goes up one dollar right and all stock goes up one dollar right and all else< else being equal else being equal this< this option value will increase by 95 this option value will increase by 95 cents< cents and if the stock was to drop a cents and if the stock was to drop a dollar< dollar then the dollar then the option< option value would also drop by 95 cents option value would also drop by 95 cents so< so basically this is what delta so basically this is what delta measures< measures so in this case if it goes up measures so in this case if it goes up 20< 20 we just take 0. 95 times 20 dollars 20 we just take 0.

95 times 20 dollars that< that is a profit of 19 that is a profit of 19 so< so how do we calculate the roi we just so how. do we calculate the roi we just take< take this divided by the cost which we take this divided by the cost which we paid< paid which is 54. 9 and we want to take a paid which is 54.

9 and we want to take a look< look at the mark box right mark is look at the mark box right mark is basically< basically just the basically just the uh< uh mid price between the bid and us uh mid price between the bid and us because< because if we were to take a look at the because if we were to take a look at the leaps leaps leaps specifically< specifically you'll notice that the specifically you'll notice that the billion< billion us spread is pretty wide so you billion us spread is pretty. wide so you never< never want to just go and buy off the never want to just go and buy off the ask ask ask column< column down here because you'll be column down here because you'll be paying< paying more than you need to right paying more than you need to right because< because you can most of the time get it because you can most of the time get it at< at the mid price so we are taking the at the mid price so we are taking the mid< mid price which is 54. 9 so mid price which is 54.

9 so very< very simple and straightforward you can very simple and straightforward you can see< see that if you're using stocks see that if you're using stocks your your your return< return would be lower than if you were return would be lower than if you were to< to buy leaps now what happens if the to buy leaps now what happens if the stock< stock was to go down all right what stock was to go down all right what happens< happens to the price of both of them so happens to the price of both of them so you< you can see down here i've created this you can see down here i've created this uh< uh two little bar down here uh two little bar down here that< that measures right the intrinsic value that measures right the intrinsic value as< as well as the extrinsic value down here as well as the extrinsic value down here now< now this is something that i do not see now this is something that i do not see any< any other people uh talk about i. do not any other people uh talk about i do not see< see any other youtube videos that are see any other youtube videos that are met< met showing this uh change or this bar met showing this uh change or this bar in< in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic value< value so this is something that you value so this is something that you probably< probably only can see it here all right probably only can see it here all right so< so this is very important for you to so this is very important for you to understand< understand so i want you to just pay understand so i want you to just pay attention< attention for the next few minutes so i attention for the next few minutes so i can< can explain this to you so can explain this to you so you< you can see that the stock is 100 you can see that the stock is 100 intrinsic< intrinsic value okay so the stock price intrinsic value okay so the stock price right< right now 102. 60 cents that is the right now 102.

#### Topic 1

60 cents that is the intrinsic< intrinsic value whereas for leaps. right intrinsic value whereas for leaps right you< you only paid 54. 90 you only paid 54.

90 so< so what this consists of is. actually so what this consists of is actually 52. 60< 52.

60 in intrinsic value and you're 52. 60 in intrinsic value and you're paying< paying two dollars and 30 cents for time paying two dollars and 30 cents for time value< value which is the extrinsic value so value which is the extrinsic value so how< how. do i know you can just simply take a how do i know you can just simply take a look< look at this column down here you can look at this column down here you can see< see it says 52.

6 in terms of intrinsic see it says 52. 6 in terms of intrinsic and< and 2.

30 cents in terms of extrinsic so and 2. 30 cents in terms of extrinsic so this< this is all you are paying in terms of this is all you are paying in terms of intrinsic< intrinsic okay so it means that if the intrinsic okay so it means. that if the stock< stock actually just drops to zero stock actually just drops to zero dollars< dollars right dollars right stock< stock guess what you lose an intrinsic stock guess what you lose an intrinsic value< value of 102.

60 value of 102. 60 but< but for leaps you can't lose more than but for leaps you can't lose more than. what< what you paid right you already paid what you paid right you already paid only< only 52.

60 for your intrinsic value only 52. 60 for your intrinsic value right< right so if the stock goes to zero right so if the stock goes to zero that's< that's the most you can lose so you you that's the most you can lose so you you you< you do not even get to lose any uh thing you do not even get to lose any uh thing down< down here because you never paid for down here because you never paid for this< this value down here this value down here okay< okay so that is why leaps is a very good okay so that is why leaps is a very good tool< tool for a reducing risk because you are tool for a reducing risk because you are actually< actually losing less if the market actually losing less if the market really< really goes to zero the stock really really goes to zero the stock really goes< goes to zero now goes to zero now. let's< let's see what's the effect if the let's see what's the effect if the market< market actually drops so if the market market actually drops so if the market drops< drops or the underlying stock drops ten drops or the underlying stock drops ten dollars< dollars the stock is very dollars the stock is very straightforward< straightforward right you lose ten straightforward right you lose ten dollars< dollars in intrinsic value you can see dollars in intrinsic value you can see the< the the value is lost here the the value is lost here and< and the remaining intrinsic value and the remaining intrinsic value uh< uh this is not correct this should be uh this is not correct this should be actually< actually 92 dollars and 60 cents let me actually 92 dollars and 60 cents let me just< just change it here very quickly so this just change it here very quickly so this is is is 92.

60 92. 60 92.

60 because< because you have already lost 10 dollars because you have already lost 10 dollars what< what about the leaps what about the leaps what< what do you think is the value after the what do you think is the value after the stock< stock has dropped 10 dollars all right stock has dropped 10 dollars all right so so so if< if it drops ten dollars right right now if it drops ten dollars right right now the< the stock will be worth ninety two the stock will be worth ninety two dollars< dollars sixty cents dollars sixty cents and< and the leaps will be forty five dollars and the leaps will be forty five dollars and< and ninety eight cents so why is this so and ninety eight cents so why is this so right< right you see right you see when< when the stock drops ten dollars the when the stock drops ten dollars the intrinsic< intrinsic value portion of the leaps intrinsic value portion of the leaps also< also lose 10 dollars also lose 10 dollars but< but if you notice but if you notice the< the extrinsic value actually gained a the extrinsic value actually gained a dollar< dollar and eight cents dollar and eight cents so< so the intrinsic value loss but your so the intrinsic value loss but your extrinsic< extrinsic value gained so how do i know extrinsic value gained so how do i know this< this is the exact amount very simple this is the exact amount very simple let's< let's say on the day itself on the day let's say on the day itself on the day itself< itself you bought the leap itself you bought the leap and< and the underlying stock dropped 10 and the underlying stock dropped 10 dollars< dollars you would take a look at the 60 dollars you would take a look at the 60 strike< strike price down here strike price down here so< so that's because you see so that's because you see if< if you buy at 50 the strike price and if you buy at 50 the strike price and the< the market drops 10 the market drops 10 it< it means right now the the leaps would it means right now the the leaps would be< be 10 be 10 closer< closer to at the money you'll be 10 closer to at the money you'll be 10 closer< closer at the money so this would be the closer at the money so this would be the value< value where the leaps would be at value where the leaps would be at when< when it drops down uh ten dollars when it drops down uh ten dollars again< again assuming everything else or else again assuming everything else or else is< is equal the volatility does not change is equal the volatility does not change okay< okay so you can see down here that the okay so you can see down here that the extrinsic< extrinsic. value is three dollars and 38 extrinsic value is three dollars and 38 cents< cents and then previously the extrinsic cents and then previously the extrinsic value< value was only two dollars and thirty value was only two dollars and thirty cents< cents so that means it has gained in cents so that means it has gained in value< value so instead of losing ten dollars value so instead of losing ten dollars right< right just like the stock you only lose right just like the stock you only lose eight< eight dollars in 92 cents and the reason eight dollars in 92 cents and the reason is< is because your extrinsic value has is because your extrinsic value has actually< actually helped question the loss of actually helped question the loss of your< your intrinsic value loss your intrinsic value loss so< so on the downside so on the downside the< the stock the stock has< has no protection has no protection but< but the leaps has the extrinsic value but the leaps has the extrinsic value working< working for you so many people think of working for you so many people think of extrinsic< extrinsic value as a bad thing and most extrinsic value as a bad thing and most of< of the time it is right because of the time it is right because it< it actually decays but when the market it actually decays but when the market actually< actually drops actually drops it< it drops very quickly as well you will it drops very quickly as well you will be< be actually losing lesser because your be actually losing lesser because your extrinsic< extrinsic value is helping you cushion extrinsic value is helping you cushion the< the loss from any intrinsic loss of the the loss from any intrinsic loss of the lip< lip so that's why you only lose eight lip so that's why you only lose eight dollars< dollars ninety two cents when you paid dollars ninety two cents when you paid fifty< fifty four dollars and ninety cents fifty four dollars and ninety cents right< right now here's another question for right now here's another question for you you you what< what if the stock drops sixty dollars what if the stock drops sixty dollars right right right we< we know that the intrinsic value loss we know that the intrinsic value loss would< would be 60 for the stock is very would be 60 for the stock is very straightforward< straightforward you would lose 6 000 straightforward you would lose 6 000 all< all right per 100 shares all right per 100 shares so< so there's a 6k loss so there's a 6k loss now< now what about the leaps now what about the leaps how< how much do you actually lose because if how much do you actually lose because if you< you see the value of the leaps which you you see the value of the leaps which you paid< paid for is only 54. 90 paid for is only 54.

#### Topic 2

90 you< you pay 54. 90 and the stock dropped 60 you pay 54.

90 and the stock dropped 60 dollars< dollars so that is more than the value dollars so that is more than the value of< of the leaps of the leaps so< so what is the value of the leaps right so what is the value of the leaps right now now now take< take a moment to just think about this take a moment to just think about this by< by the way if you've enjoyed this video by the way if you've enjoyed this video so< so far i'd appreciate if you hit the so far i'd appreciate if you hit the subscribe< subscribe button and just give a thumbs subscribe button and just give a thumbs up< up so i can create more videos like this up so i can create more videos like this for< for you in the future all right back to for you in the future all right back to the< the video okay so have you come up with the video okay so have you come up with a< a guess on what's the value of the leaps a guess on what's the value of the leaps after< after you drop 60 dollars after you drop 60 dollars well< well the answer is that the leaves did well the answer is that the leaves did not< not actually go to zero not actually go to zero it< it actually still has a value of 11 and it actually still has a value of 11 and 10< 10 cents so how do i know this basically 10 cents so how do i know this basically all< all you have to. do is just take a look all you have to do is just take a look at< at the 110 strike price that is because at the 110 strike price that is because if< if the stock was to drop if the stock was to drop sixty< sixty dollars and you bought a strike of sixty dollars and you bought a strike of fifty< fifty dollars that means the stock right fifty dollars that means the stock right now< now is forty two dollars and sixty cents now is forty two dollars and sixty cents your< your fifty dollar strike will be out of your fifty dollar strike will be out of the< the money right so it will be sixty the money right so it will be sixty dollars< dollars down from this strike price it dollars down from this strike price it will< will be down here and again all else will be down here and again all else being< being equal you will see that the being equal you will see that the extrinsic< extrinsic value there is still 11 extrinsic value there is still 11 dollars< dollars and 10 cents that's still 11 10 dollars and 10 cents that's still 11 10 cents< cents left it's not zero so why is it cents left it's not zero so why is it that< that way well again that's because the that way well again that's because the intrinsic< intrinsic value first of all you can't intrinsic value first of all you can't lose< lose more than the amount that you paid lose more than the amount that you paid right< right you paid 52. 60 even though if you right you paid 52.

60 even though if you drop< drop 60 dollars or it drops a hundred drop. 60 dollars or it drops a hundred dollars< dollars you're only going to lose 52. 60 dollars you're only going to lose 52.

60 so< so your intrinsic value becomes zero now so your intrinsic value becomes zero now your< your extrinsic value on the other hand your extrinsic value on the other hand actually< actually gains value so it gains to actually gains value so it gains to eleven< eleven dollars ten cents as you have eleven dollars ten cents as you have seen< seen here right so it has gained a value seen here right so it has gained a value. of< of eight dollars eighty cents on the way of eight dollars eighty cents on the way down< down so you can see again the extrinsic down so you can see again the extrinsic value< value has come in to help you cushion value has come in to help you cushion this< this loss down here so instead of losing this loss down here so instead of losing the< the full value of the the full value of the 52. 60< 52.

60 in terms of intrinsic value your 52. 60 in terms of intrinsic value your extrinsic< extrinsic value helped you cushion that extrinsic value helped you cushion that and< and the total loss which you would and the total loss which you would experience< experience from this leaps would be only experience from this leaps would be only forty< forty three dollars and eighty cents forty three dollars and eighty cents right< right you bought it for fifty four right you bought it for fifty four dollars< dollars ninety cents you only lost forty dollars ninety cents you only lost forty three< three dollars eighty cents whereas for three dollars eighty cents whereas for the< the stock you have lost sixty dollars the stock you have lost sixty dollars which< which is six thousand dollars so here's which is six thousand dollars so here's the< the thing when the market goes up the thing when the market goes up leaps< leaps make more than stocks as you have leaps make more than stocks as you have seen< seen the return is higher and as stocks seen the return is higher and as stocks drop< drop down you actually lose less because drop down you actually lose less because of< of this extrinsic value down here this of this extrinsic value down here this extrinsic< extrinsic value helps you cushion any extrinsic value helps you cushion any loss< loss that you made on this intrinsic loss that you made on this intrinsic value< value right and then it still gives you value right and then it still gives you a< a chance because if there's still time a chance because if there's still time left< left and the market goes back up again left and the market goes back up again you< you will start to gain back intrinsic you will start to gain back intrinsic value< value and of course on the other hand value and of course on the other hand you< you will start to lose this extrinsic you will start to lose this extrinsic value< value so it's kind of a little bit like value so it's kind of a. little bit like a< a tango back and forth but the key thing a tango back and forth but the key thing is< is that this extrinsic value can help is that this extrinsic value can help you< you cushion on the downside so on the you cushion on the downside so on the upside< upside you make more because you are upside you make more because you are actually< actually paying less and on the downside actually paying less and on the downside you< you actually lose less compared to you actually lose less compared to buying< buying shares out right because you have buying shares out right because you have this< this extrinsic value to cushion you so i this extrinsic value to cushion you so i hope< hope you understand a little bit better hope you understand a little bit better about< about leaves and why this can be a very about leaves and why this can be a very fantastic< fantastic tool for you especially if you fantastic tool for you especially if you you< you know you look to you know you look to uh< uh get into that particular stock for a uh get into that particular stock for a long< long period of time about a year or two long period of time about a year or two years< years or so years or so so< so you might want to consider buying so you might want to consider buying leaps< leaps rather than just buying shares out leaps rather than just buying shares out outright outright outright alright< alright guys that's it for this video if alright guys that's it for this video if you< you like this please subscribe and hit you like this please subscribe and hit the< the notification bell so you'll be the notification bell so you'll be informed< informed whenever i release a new video informed whenever i release a new video like< like this and as always thank you for like this and as always thank you for watching< watching appreciate your time and i'll watching appreciate your time and i'll see<

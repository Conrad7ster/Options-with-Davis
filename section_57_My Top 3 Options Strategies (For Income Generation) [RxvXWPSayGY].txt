=====================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we< we are going to be talking about the top we are going to be talking about the top three< three or rather my top three option three or rather my top three option strategies< strategies for income generation and strategies for income generation and I've< I've got people that have asked me you I've got people that have asked me you know< know Davis I want to put on some option know Davis I want to put on some option strategies< strategies that can generate a strategies that can generate a consistent< consistent income for me you know what consistent income for me you know what are< are the strategies that can do that for are the strategies that can do that for me< me then look low further than this list me then look low further than this list right< right so in no particular order let's right so in no particular order let's start< start off with income strategy number start off with income strategy number one< one and that is the short strangle so one and that is the short strangle so what< what is the short strangle now the short what is the short strangle now the short strangle< strangle is an undefined neutral option strangle is an undefined neutral option strategy< strategy with the combination of a shot strategy with the combination of a shot put< put and a short call so there are just put and a short call so there are just two< two shot options in this strategy so the two shot options in this strategy so the way< way you want to place this is basically way you want to place this is basically uh< uh this is where the current market uh this is where the current market price< price is roughly somewhere here so what price is roughly somewhere here so what you< you want to do is you want to sell a put you want to do is you want to sell a put option< option below where the market is and you option below where the market is and you want< want to sell a call option above where want to sell a call option above where the< the market is so your profit zone is the market is so your profit zone is actually< actually pretty wide as you can see actually pretty wide as you can see right< right your profit zone is anywhere in right your profit zone is anywhere in between< between the short strikes at expiration between the short strikes at expiration now< now you might be wondering why is this now you might be wondering why is this strategy< strategy called the short strangle right strategy called the short strangle right why< why is it the strangle now that is why is it the strangle now that is because< because one day the options naming because one day the options naming committee< committee right it's a group of people committee right it's a group of people where< where they get together and then they where they get together and then they just< just decide the names for such option just decide the names for such option strategies< strategies they get together and they strategies they get together and they had< had a little bit of a drink right they had a little bit of a drink right they were< were probably all Tipsy and one of the were probably all Tipsy and one of the guys< guys probably said something to offend guys probably said something to offend another< another person and the person got so another person and the person got so angry< angry upset what they did is he angry upset what they did is he stretched< stretched forth his hands in a way to to stretched forth his hands in a way to to strangle< strangle the person right it just strangle the person right it just started< started to to shake his neck and he got started to to shake his neck and he got so< so upset and the other person said hey so upset and the other person said hey let's< let's call this strategy the short let's call this strategy the short strangle< strangle right because on the right hand strangle right because on the right hand side< side you have your right hand that's the side you have your right hand that's the call< call side and on the left hand you have call side and on the left hand you have the< the put side you put them together this the put side you put them together this is< is the strangle so this is called the is the strangle so this is called the short< short strangle because one day one of short strangle because one day one of the< the guys had too much to drink and just the guys had too much to drink and just choked< choked the other person so the idea is choked the other person so the idea is that< that you know they would strangle the that you know they would strangle the market< market you know with both ends and they market you know with both ends and they will< will grab whatever profit that it is and will grab whatever profit that it is and take< take it out and that's where you get take it out and that's where you get these< I'm< I'm kidding guys I hope you know I'm I'm kidding guys I hope you know I'm kidding< kidding I have no idea whatsoever no kidding I have no idea whatsoever no clue< clue why it's called the shortest clue why it's called the shortest triangle< triangle it's such an odd name to me but triangle it's such an odd name to me but if< if you know please leave in the comment if you know please leave in the comment section< section below let us all know why this section below let us all know why this is< is called the strangle right all right is called the strangle right all right so< so why is it good for income generation so why is it good for income generation well< well first of all it has a high win rate well first of all it has a high win rate and< and by high win rate you're roughly and by high win rate you're roughly looking< looking at anywhere around 70 percent so looking at anywhere around 70 percent so let's< let's say for example if you were to put let's say for example if you were to put the< the short strangle using the expected the short strangle using the expected move< move right expected range so basically move right expected range so basically let's< let's just use the 16 Deltas right so let's just use the 16 Deltas right so generally< generally the expected move the expected generally the expected move the expected range< range can be depicted by 16 Delta range can be depicted by 16 Delta options< options on both sides so as we already options on both sides so as we already know< know 16 Delta is also a rough estimation know 16 Delta is also a rough estimation for< for whether the strikes you know the for whether the strikes you know the percentage< percentage of it being in the money and percentage of it being in the money and expression< expression so let's say for example you expression so let's say for example you know< know if it breaches the short strike at know if it breaches the short strike at expiration< expiration right what is the percentage expiration right what is the percentage it's< it's roughly 16 chance so this is a it's roughly 16 chance so this is a rough< rough estimate so on the downside also rough estimate so on the downside also there< there is a 16 chance that it will be there is a 16 chance that it will be below< below this put strike at expiration so below this put strike at expiration so if< if you put 16 on the top side 16 on the if you put 16 on the top side 16 on the bottom< bottom side that lives in the middle bottom side that lives in the middle roughly< roughly 68 but as we also know that the roughly 68 but as we also know that the IV< IV most of the time is more than the Irv IV most of the time is more than the Irv which< which is the realized volatility that which is the realized volatility that means< means the implied volatility is more means the implied volatility is more often< often overstated compared to the RV often overstated compared to the RV which< which means to say that price stays which means to say that price stays actually< actually more often in this range that actually more often in this range that it< it does not which means to say you will it does not which means to say you will have< have a win rate that is higher than 68 have a win rate that is higher than 68 right< right so I've created a video all about right so I've created a video all about this< this on the expected move I also created this on the expected move I also created a< a separate video on the short strangle a separate video on the short strangle where< where I share my trades as well so you where I share my trades as well so you can< can go ahead to my channel and look for can go ahead to my channel and look for the< the video now it also has pure Theta the video now it also has pure Theta Decay< Decay because there are only two short Decay because there are only two short options< options here there are no long options options here there are no long options so< so when you have only short options in a so when you have only short options in a strategy< strategy then you're going to get pure strategy then you're going to get pure Theta< Theta Decay compared to you know those Theta Decay compared to you know those other< other strategies where there are long other strategies where there are long options< options involved it's also very options involved it's also very versatile< versatile and very easy to roll so for versatile and very easy to roll so for example< example if you know one side gets tested example if you know one side gets tested let's< let's say for example let me remove the let's say for example let me remove the drawing< drawing let's say the put side gets drawing let's say the put side gets tested< tested it's very easy for you to just tested it's very easy for you to just roll< roll down the call stride and then get a roll down the call stride and then get a credit< credit on it right if you were to put on credit on it right if you were to put on some< some defined risk strategy like the iron some defined risk strategy like the iron Condor< Condor you know it sometimes could be a Condor you know it sometimes could be a little< little bit hard to get more credit little bit hard to get more credit because< because you have that long option right because you have that long option right that< that long option is going to cost more that long option is going to cost more as< as you start to bring it closer to the as you start to bring it closer to the market< market all right so it also takes market all right so it also takes advantage< advantage of the fact that IV is more advantage of the fact that IV is more than< than RV as I've already discussed now than RV as I've already discussed now you< you might be wondering Davis but the you might be wondering Davis but the short< short strangle is an undefined risk short strangle is an undefined risk strategy< strategy and it's a little bit you know strategy and it's a little bit you know risky< risky right I'm afraid that the market risky right I'm afraid that the market you< you know might crash all the way to zero you know might crash all the way to zero on< on my shoot all the way up to the sky on my shoot all the way up to the sky and< and also you know if I were to put this and also you know if I were to put this on< on the index ETFs the buying power on the index ETFs the buying power reduction< reduction the BPR is going to be pretty reduction the BPR is going to be pretty high< high and I don't have the capital to put high and I don't have the capital to put that< that on so what can I do right so guess that on so what can I do right so guess what< what I got you covered do not worry what I got you covered do not worry because< because you can go with the alternate because you can go with the alternate active< active income strategy 1A and that is active income strategy 1A and that is the< the iron Condor so if you notice the the iron Condor so if you notice the iron< iron Condor is actually a very similar iron Condor is actually a very similar trait< trait with the strangle right you can trait with. the strangle right you can see< see that the strangle let me just remove see that the strangle let me just remove the< the short Stripes can be the same it's the short Stripes can be the same it's just< just that you buy a call option at the just that you buy a call option at the top< top to protect your max loss to the top top to protect your max loss to the top and< and you also buy a put option at the and you also buy a put option at the bottom< bottom right to protect uh you know in bottom right to protect uh you know in case< case the price goes much further down so case the price goes much further down so this< this is how you come up with the iron this is how you come up with the iron Condor< Condor so the iron Condor is a defined Condor so the iron Condor is a defined neutral< neutral option strategy with the neutral option strategy with the combination< combination of the shot put spread and combination of the shot put spread and the< the short call spread so you as you can the short call spread so you as you can see< see you have both sides down here you see you have both sides down here you have< have the call spread and you have the have the call spread and you have the put< put spread now why is this name the iron put spread now why is this name the iron Condor< Condor well that's again because the Condor well that's again because the options< options uh committee the naming options uh committee the naming committee< committee they got together and they committee they got together and they started< started to you know started to you know I'm< I'm just kidding guys I have no idea why I'm just kidding guys I have no idea why this< this is called the iron Condor as well this is called the iron Condor as well now< now I get the fact that the Condor is a now I get the fact that the Condor is a bird< bird right it's a bird with very long bird right it's a bird with very long wings< wings so maybe that's why they decided wings so maybe that's why they decided to< to name this iron Condor or rather the to name this iron Condor or rather the Condor< Condor right because there are wings for Condor right because there are wings for your< your you know this strategy they are the your you know this strategy they are the wings< wings can be pretty wide but iron wings can be pretty wide but iron man< man that beats me why is this iron in man that beats me why is this iron in fact< fact this was being brought up by one of fact this was being brought up by one of my< my subscribers where he mentioned that my subscribers where he mentioned that he< he also gets why it's called the Condor he also gets why it's called the Condor but< but why is it the iron why is this the but why is it the iron why is this the iron< iron and not the Diamond the gold the iron and not the Diamond the gold the steel< steel the bronze so guys if you have any steel the bronze so guys if you have any idea< idea why they call this the iron Condor idea why they call this the iron Condor please< please do you know put it down in the please do you know put it down in the comment< comment section below let us all be comment section below let us all be enlightened< enlightened while it's iron Condor enlightened while it's iron Condor alright< alright so why is this good for income alright so why is this good for income Generation< Generation Well it has a decently High Generation Well it has a decently High win< win rate now it's not as high as the win rate now it's not as high as the short< short strangle mainly because you have short strangle mainly because you have the< the long options on both sides and that the long options on both sides and that takes< takes away you know the premium which takes away you know the premium which you< you receive for selling this two shot you receive for selling this two shot options< options right because the long options options right because the long options you< you have to pay a debit for it so you're you have to pay a debit for it so you're removing< removing some of the premium which you removing some of the premium which you receive< receive the total premium and that also receive the total premium and that also reduces< reduces your break-even price and that reduces your break-even price and that is< is why you have a lower win rate also is why you have a lower win rate also it's< it's good because the max risk is kept it's good because the max risk is kept right< right so if you're new to trading this right so if you're new to trading this is< is good for you you right it's good for is good for you you right it's good for beginners< beginners you don't have to worry in beginners you don't have to worry in case< case you know the market shoots all the case you know the market shoots all the way< way down or go all the way up because way down or go all the way up because you< you already know that your max risk is you already know that your max risk is whatever< whatever it is when you first put on the whatever it is when you first put on the trade< trade and this also takes advantage of trade and this also takes advantage of the< the fact that IV is more than RV again the fact that IV is more than RV again as< as we already know most of the time as we already know most of the time especially< especially on the index ETFs the IV is especially on the index ETFs the IV is often< often overstated to the RV that means often overstated to the RV that means that< that the market will stay more often in that the market will stay more often in this< this Zone than it does not so that gives this Zone than it does not so that gives you< you a pretty nice high decently High win you a pretty nice high decently High win rate< rate for the iron Condor all right rate for the iron Condor all right income< income strategy number two and that is income strategy number two and that is the< the Jade laser so first of all why is the Jade laser so first of all why is this< this called the jet lizard now for this this called the jet lizard now for this I< I actually know and this is actually I actually know and this is actually named< named by the folks at tastytrade or named by the folks at tastytrade or rather< rather the two ladies there that's rather the two ladies there that's working< working there Jade lizard the name is working there Jade lizard the name is Jenny< Jenny and Liz so I believe they just Jenny and Liz so I believe they just named< named this after their initial right one named this after their initial right one is< is Jenny the other is Liz so that is why is Jenny the other is Liz so that is why they< they have this name so the Jade lizard they have this name so the Jade lizard that's< that's why I know it's not by the that's why I know it's not by the options< options naming committee the tasty trade options naming committee the tasty trade folks< folks they took this one right so what folks they took this one right so what is< is the Jade lizard an undefined neutral is the Jade lizard an undefined neutral to< to bullish option strategy with the to bullish option strategy with the combination< combination of a shot put and a short combination of a shot put and a short call< call spread so for the first time you call spread so for the first time you notice< notice that there is a combination of notice that there is a combination of two< two types of strategy you have the shot two types of strategy you have the shot put< put which is the undefined risk strategy put which is the undefined risk strategy and< and then you have a short call spread and then you have a short call spread which< which is a defined risk strategy so when which is a defined risk strategy so when you< you combine these two together you have you combine these two together you have what< what you call the Jade lizard now the what you call the Jade lizard now the Jade< Jade lizard is a pretty unique strategy Jade lizard is a pretty unique strategy because< because although you have a call spread because although you have a call spread on< on the top side there is actually no on the top side there is actually no risk< risk to the upside right you want to risk to the upside right you want to design< design this where there's no risk to the design this where there's no risk to the upside< upside whereby if the market really upside whereby if the market really shoots< shoots through the call spread you shoots through the call spread you actually< actually do not have to worry about it actually do not have to worry about it and< and why it can have no risk to the and why it can have no risk to the upside< upside is because of the way it's upside is because of the way it's constructed< constructed right so remember first constructed right so remember first thing< thing what you want to know is that our thing what you want to know is that our Max< Max loss on the spread is basically the Max loss on the spread is basically the width< width minus any premium which you width minus any premium which you receive< receive so let's say for example you put receive so let's say for example you put on< on a five dollar wide width right let's on a five dollar wide width right let's say< say it's a five dollar wide spread that say it's a five dollar wide spread that you're< you're putting on and let's say you you're putting on and let's say you receive< receive two dollars credit for it so if receive two dollars credit for it so if you< you receive two dollars credit on a five you receive two dollars credit on a five dollar< dollar wide spread your max loss would dollar wide spread your max loss would just< just be three dollars or rather 300 per just be three dollars or rather 300 per spread< spread that you put on per contract so spread that you put on per contract so in< in this case the total credit that's in this case the total credit that's received< received for this trade in total that received for this trade in total that means< means the call spread plus the shot put means the call spread plus the shot put right< right you want to add these two together right you want to add these two together it< it has to be more than this call spread it has to be more than this call spread so< so let's say for example for this shot so let's say for example for this shot put< put let's say you're able to get three put let's say you're able to get three dollars< dollars in terms of credit for selling dollars in terms of credit for selling this< this shot put and for this call spread this shot put and for this call spread let's< let's say you're able to get about a let's say you're able to get about a dollar< dollar fifty cents so what this means is dollar fifty cents so what this means is that< that for this the total that for this the total you're< you're able to get four dollars fifty you're able to get four dollars fifty cents< cents for this jet lizard now if you get cents for this jet lizard now if you get four< four dollars 50 cents for this Jade four dollars 50 cents for this Jade lizard< lizard in order for you to have no risk lizard in order for you to have no risk to< to the upside how much or rather what's to the upside how much or rather what's the< the width do you think it should be for the width do you think it should be for the< the call spread now if you say it should the call spread now if you say it should be< be at most four dollars then you're be at most four dollars then you're right< right right so let's say for example if right right so let's say for example if the< the width is four dollars then guess the width is four dollars then guess what< what even though if the market goes all what even though if the market goes all the< the way past this call spread because the way past this call spread because the< the total premium you receive is 4. 50 the total premium you receive is 4.

50 you< you will still have 50 cents even though you will still have 50 cents even though it< it goes through your call spread at the it goes through your call spread at the end< end expiration right so that is why you end expiration right so that is why you they< they construct it this way right there they construct it this way right there is< is no risk to the upside and you do not is no risk to the upside and you do not have< have to worry even though if the market have to worry even though if the market keeps< keeps going up so why is it good for keeps going up so why is it good for income< income generation well firstly it has a income generation well firstly it has a very< very high win rate now because there's very high win rate now because there's no< no risk to the upside right on the top no risk to the upside right on the top side< side if you look at your p l graph it's side if you look at your p l graph it's all< all profit right although the profit all profit right although the profit down< down here starts to get lesser as it down here starts to get lesser as it pass< pass your call spread but nevertheless pass your call spread but nevertheless it's< it's still a profit that is why you have it's still a profit that is why you have a< a high win rate which is actually pretty a high win rate which is actually pretty similar< similar to as though you put on just the similar to as though you put on just the shot< shot put now it also has no wrist the shot put now it also has no wrist the upside< upside and again you know what it does upside and again you know what it does is< is that it takes advantage of the is that it takes advantage of the positive< positive drift you see if you were to positive drift you see if you were to put< put this on the index ETS like for put this on the index ETS like for example< example this is the QQQ we know that example this is the QQQ we know that over< over time it's going to just keep going over time it's going to just keep going higher< higher right so as if you were to just higher right so as if you were to just look< look at the past 20 30 years you see look at the past 20 30 years you see that< that the prices are much lower and over that the prices are much lower and over time< time it will just keep making new highs time it will just keep making new highs so< so if you were to put this on the index so if you were to put this on the index ETFs< ETFs even though if the market kept ETFs even though if the market kept making< making new highs you don't really have making new highs you don't really have to< to worry right so I've got a few people to worry right so I've got a few people that< that reached out to me you know they put that reached out to me you know they put on< on the iron Condor normal one and they on the iron Condor normal one and they keep< keep getting tested on the call side so keep getting tested on the call side so they< they keep saying you know my call site they keep saying you know my call site gets< gets tested I keep losing money on the gets tested I keep losing money on the call< call side what should I do well the call side what should I do well the alternative< alternative is to just put on you know alternative is to just put on you know such< such thing like the Jade lizard because such thing like the Jade lizard because in< in this case there is no risk to the in this case there is no risk to the upside< upside so even though in the event where upside so even though in the event where the< the market really goes to the moon you the market really goes to the moon you still< still get some Prof of it okay and it still get some Prof of. it okay and it also< also takes advantage of the put skill in also takes advantage of the put skill in the< the index ETFs so what is the put skill the index ETFs so what is the put skill so< so the put skill I mentioned this many so the put skill I mentioned this many times< times before basically the implied times before basically the implied volatility volatility volatility right< right on each of the individual strikes right on each of the individual strikes are< are different right as we already know are different right as we already know so< so the individual strikes basically uh so the individual strikes basically uh the< the implied volatility for each of the the implied volatility for each of the strikes< strikes gets higher as the strikes gets strikes gets higher as the strikes gets lower< lower right so for example let's say uh lower right so for example let's say uh the< the long call let's say the volatility the long call let's say the volatility implant< implant volatility for this is 30 so for implant volatility for this is 30 so for the< the lower strikes this might be let's the lower strikes this might be let's say< say 32 and as it goes much lower maybe say 32 and as it goes much lower maybe this< this becomes 37 so as we already know this becomes 37 so as we already know implied< implied volatility has uh implication on implied volatility has uh implication on the< the premium which receive right the premium which receive right generally< generally the higher the volatility of generally the higher the volatility of the< the strike or the option we are going to the strike or the option we are going to get< get a higher premium so in this case you get a higher premium so in this case you can< can see what we are doing is that we are can see what we are doing is that we are selling< selling the higher volatility options selling the higher volatility options and< and we are buying the lower volatility and we are buying the lower volatility options< options so in this case we are actually options so in this case we are actually really< really taking advantage of this put really taking advantage of this put skill< skill right because you're selling a skill right because you're selling a relatively< relatively more expensive option and relatively more expensive option and you're< you're buying a relatively cheaper you're buying a relatively cheaper option< option so that is why this is actually option so that is why this is actually very< very good if you put this on the index very good if you put this on the index ETFs< ETFs now again you might be saying but ETFs now again you might be saying but Davis< Davis this again is an undefined risk Davis this again is an undefined risk strategy< strategy right I'm afraid of you know strategy right I'm afraid of you know undefined< undefined risks I do not want to take on undefined risks I do not want to take on any< any undefined risk and guess what I got any undefined risk and guess what I got you< you covered as well because we are going you covered as well because we are going to< to the defined risk version of the Jade to the defined risk version of the Jade lizard< lizard and that is the Jade iron Condor lizard and that is the Jade iron Condor by< by the way if you

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video now where did this back to the video now where did this Jade< Jade iron condo name come from so this Jade iron condo name come from so this is< is one of the names but I'm proud to say is one of the names but I'm proud to say that< that I came up with the name and the that I came up with the name and the reason< reason I came up with the name is mainly reason I came up with the name is mainly because< because I just took after this the jit because I just took after this the jit lizard< lizard because with the Jade lizard we lizard because with the Jade lizard we already< already know that hey it's a trade where already know that hey it's a trade where there's< there's no risk to the upside so the J there's no risk to the upside so the J iron< iron Condor is essentially just an iron iron Condor is essentially just an iron Condor< Condor construct as you can see there is Condor construct as you can see there is just< just the shot put spread and the short just the shot put spread and the short call< call spread but we want to do it in a call spread but we want to do it in a way< way whereby there's no risk to the way whereby there's no risk to the upside< upside even though if the market blows upside even though if the market blows through< through the call spread so to make it through the call spread so to make it very< very simple I just call it the Jade iron very simple I just call it the Jade iron Condor< Condor right so this is again something Condor right so this is again something that< that I. name no I wasn't drinking any that I name no I wasn't drinking any booze< booze when I was naming this it's just booze when I was naming this it's just name< name of the laser so in the future name of the laser so in the future videos< videos if you were to hear me mention videos if you were to hear me mention about< about the word jet iron Condor then you about the word jet iron Condor then you know< know oh Davis is putting on an Iron know oh Davis is putting on an Iron Condor< Condor with no wrist to the upside right Condor with no wrist to the upside right so< so as you can see down here it's very so as you can see down here it's very similar< similar to the Jade lizard basically the similar to the Jade lizard basically the credit< credit which you receive down here plus credit which you receive down here plus the< the credit over here right it has to be the credit over here right it has to be greater< greater than the spread width over here greater than the spread width over here right< right so let's say for example for this right so let's say for example for this put< put spread let's say if you receive two put spread let's say if you receive two dollars< dollars for this and for this call dollars for this and for this call spread< spread maybe you receive a dollar fifty spread maybe you receive a dollar fifty cents< cents then you know your spread down cents then you know your spread down here< here wants to be no bigger than three here wants to be no bigger than three dollars< dollars why right in this case then you dollars why right in this case then you you< you have a total of 3.

50 cents in terms you have a total of 3. 50 cents in terms of< of the premium if it goes past your call of the premium if it goes past your call spread< spread you'll at least still get 50 spread you'll at least still get 50 cents< cents so as you can see it's it's pretty cents so as you can see it's it's pretty similar< similar so this is where you want to go similar so this is where you want to go to< to your option chain and then you just to your option chain and then you just want< want to play around with the strikes to want to play around with the strikes to see< see what kind of construct you can get see what kind of construct you can get all< all right so why is it good for income all right so why is it good for income generation< generation again it has a very high win generation again it has a very high win rate< rate because like I said there's no risk rate because like I said there's no risk to< to the upside similar to the jet lizard to the upside similar to the jet lizard so< so it's pretty much like a shot put so it's pretty much like a shot put spread< spread all right so no risk to the spread all right so no risk to the upside< upside takes advantage of the positive upside takes advantage of the positive drift< drift again on index ETS because over drift again on index ETS because over time< time the market wants to go up so again time the market wants to go up so again if< if you get tested on the normal iron if you get tested on the normal iron Condor< Condor on the cold side and you you know Condor on the cold side and you you know you< you feel pain you're you're complaining you feel pain you're you're complaining all< all the time why is the market being all the time why is the market being tested< tested on the call side then guess what tested on the call side then guess what just< just put on the jet iron Condor remove just put on the jet iron Condor remove all< all this worry and pain from your life all this worry and pain from your life right< right you also have your max risk cap so right you also have your max risk cap so that< that is why this is good for beginners that is why this is good for beginners so< so even though if the market you know so even though if the market you know crashes< crashes all the way down you can't lose crashes all the way down you can't lose more< more than you know past this 250 dollars more than you know past this 250 dollars Point< Point down here or the rather the max Point down here or the rather the max risk< risk which you have risked for this risk which you have risked for this individual< individual trade all right let's get individual trade all right let's get into< into income strategy number three and into income strategy number three and that< that is the put ratio spread so you've that is the put ratio spread so you've heard< heard me talk about the put ratio spread heard me talk about the put ratio spread quite< quite a bit on my channel because I like quite a bit on my channel because I like me< me some put racial spreads one of my me some put racial spreads one of my real< real favorite strategies to put on real favorite strategies to put on because< because it is very omnidirectional right because it is very omnidirectional right so< so what is the put ratio spray it is an so what is the put ratio spray it is an undefined< undefined omnidirectional option undefined omnidirectional option strategy< strategy with the combination of a shot strategy with. the combination of a shot put< put and a long put spread all right so put and a long put spread all right so this< this is another combination of an this is another combination of an undefined< undefined risk plus a defined risk but undefined risk plus a defined risk but this< this is slightly different because the this is slightly different because the defined< defined risk down here is a debit spread defined risk down here is a debit spread whereas< whereas the shot put as a credit kind of whereas the shot put as a credit kind of a< a strategy so as you can see down here a strategy so as you can see down here there< there are two short puts over here and there are two short puts over here and then< then one long put so why I like this then one long put so why I like this strategy< strategy is because you can construct it strategy is because you can construct it in< in a way whereby you know if the market in a way whereby you know if the market goes< goes up firstly you do not lose any goes up firstly you do not lose any money< money you still receive money right you money you still receive money right you receive< receive the credit which you receive for receive the credit which you receive for selling< selling this put ratio spread and the selling this put ratio spread and the best< best thing about this is that as the best thing about this is that as the market< market comes down you actually stand to market comes down you actually stand to make< make the biggest profit compared to if make the biggest profit compared to if the< the market goes up so this is actually a the market goes up so this is actually a pretty< pretty defensive strategy right I put it pretty defensive strategy right I put it in< in a way whereby I use it to defend you in a way whereby I use it to defend you know< know my long Deltas any long Deltas I know my long Deltas any long Deltas I have< have let's say for example the income have let's say for example the income grid< grid real strategy the lips which I have grid real strategy the lips which I have or< or maybe even some of the spreads which or maybe even some of the spreads which I< I have that I put on right let's say for I have that I put on right let's say for example< example the iron condo or maybe even the example the iron condo or maybe even the strangle< strangle if the market comes down well strangle if the market comes down well at< at least on the downside I have some at least on the downside I have some protection< protection with the put ratio spread so protection with the put ratio spread so the< the whole idea down here is that your the whole idea down here is that your shot< shot put you want it to use it to shot put you want it to use it to finance< finance the long put spread right so finance the long put spread right so let's< let's say for example your shot put let's say for example your shot put let's< let's say your shot put you receive let's say your shot put you receive three< three dollars for this right so which three dollars for this right so which means< means to say what you want to do is you means to say what you want to do is you can< can purchase the long put spread for can purchase the long put spread for lesser< lesser than three dollars so let's say lesser than three dollars so let's say for< for example you know you buy a long put for example you know you buy a long put spread< spread for 2.

50 you still get 50 cents spread for 2. 50 you still get 50 cents credit< credit which means to say if the market credit which means to say if the market just< just does not go below your put strike just does not go below your put strike down< down here because your puts your put down here because your puts your put strike< strike your long put strike down here is strike your long put strike down here is where< where it starts to enter into this big where it starts to enter into this big profit< profit zone right your big profit zone profit zone right your big profit zone is< is being depicted by your long put is being depicted by your long put strike< strike and your shot puts right down strike and your shot puts right down here< here right so if it goes below here you here right so if it goes below here you start< start to make you know more but if it start to make you know more but if it goes< goes up at least you still make the goes up at least you still make the minimum< minimum so in this case our example here minimum so in this case our example here would< would be 50 cents now as for the name would be 50 cents now as for the name the< the put ratio spread guys I gotta be the put ratio spread guys I gotta be honest honest honest give< give them a clap down here because I give them a clap down here because I think< think finally they did a good job with think finally they did a good job with the< the put ratio spread because now I can the put ratio spread because now I can look< look at the name of the strategy and I look at the name of the strategy and I kind< kind of get it right because the put kind of get it right because the put ratio< ratio spread so put ratio spread it's a ratio spread so put ratio spread it's a put< put option yes and you have because a put option yes and you have because a long< long strike and a short strike and long strike and a short strike and they're< they're of differing numbers right so they're of differing numbers right so you< you can see there are two short puts and you can see there are two short puts and there's< there's one long put so this is kind of there's one long put so this is kind of a< a ratio so if one is to two one is to a ratio so if one is to two one is to three< three two is to three and that's where three two is to three and that's where you< you get the put ratio spread so I think you get the put ratio spread so I think they< they did a good job on this one so why they did a good job on this one so why is< is it good for income Generation Well it is it good for income Generation Well it has< has an extremely high win rate so of all has an extremely high win rate so of all the< the strategies that I shared down here the strategies that I shared down here the< the poor ratio spread has the highest the poor ratio spread has the highest win< win rate mainly because you see your win rate mainly because you see your profit< profit Zone down here on the downside profit Zone down here on the downside has< has been greatly increased because of has been greatly increased because of this< this long put spread down here right so this long put spread down here right so the< the long put spread makes more money as the long put spread makes more money as the< the market goes down so if you're the market goes down so if you're talking< talking about a typical put ratio spread talking about a typical put ratio spread let's< let's said one that you want to let's said one that you want to construct< construct you could construct roughly construct you could construct roughly about< about 90 win rate right if you choose to about 90 win rate right if you choose to put< put it this way otherwise it can also be put it this way otherwise it can also be pretty< pretty decently High 80 over a percent pretty decently High 80 over a percent so< so there is also no risk to the upside so there is also no risk to the upside and< and it takes advantage of the positive and it takes advantage of the positive drift< drift because the market wants to go drift because the market wants to go higher< higher over time but occasionally when higher over time but occasionally when the< the market you know does have some sort the market you know does have some sort of< of a crash or a retracement or reversal of a crash or a retracement or reversal this< this is where the put ratio spread can this is where the put ratio spread can come< come in to help you make more and also come in to help you make more and also defend< defend some of the positions you have in defend some of the positions you have in your< your portfolio remember it's very your portfolio remember it's very important< important to have an options portfolio important to have an options portfolio where< where you have different strategies that where you have different strategies that taking< taking advantage of different movements taking advantage of different movements in< in the market right if the market goes in the market right if the market goes up< up you have option strategies to take up you have option strategies to take advantage< advantage of that if the market stays in advantage of that if the market stays in the< the expected range you have strategies the expected range you have strategies to< to take advantage of that and if the to take advantage of that and if the market< market goes down below the expected market goes down below the expected range< range then you have this put ratio range then you have this put ratio spread< spread down here that can help you spread down here that can help you generate< generate some profits as well all right generate some profits as well all right and< and it also takes advantage of the put and it also takes advantage of the put skill< skill in the index ETF as you can see we skill in the index ETF as you can see we are< are selling two options at a lower are selling two options at a lower strike< strike which has a higher volatility strike which has a higher volatility than< than the one above right and it makes than the one above right and it makes more< more as the market goes down so this is more as the market goes down so this is in< in a sense a very defensive position now in a sense a very defensive position now you<. you might also be saying but Davis this you might also be saying but Davis this is< is an undefined risk strategy guess what is an undefined risk strategy guess what I< I got you covered as well do not worry I got you covered as well do not worry because< because now we have the defined risk because now we have the defined risk version< version of the put ratio spread and that version of the put ratio spread and that is< is the put broken wing butterfly now as is the put broken wing butterfly now as for< for the name why is it called the broken for the name why is it called the broken wing< wing butterfly wing butterfly I'm< I'm pretty sure you know the answer by I'm pretty sure you know the answer by now< now guys and just as I was getting very now guys and just as I was getting very hopeful< hopeful about the naming committee now hopeful about the naming committee now they've< they've done it right because right now they've done it right because right now officially< officially we have an insect a bird that officially we have an insect a bird that can't< can't fly because it's made of iron and can't fly because it's made of iron and someone< someone choking someone else okay so one someone choking someone else okay so one is< is the put Brooklyn butterfly it is is the put Brooklyn butterfly it is basically< basically the Define Rich version of the basically the Define Rich version of the put< put ratio spread right it's also put ratio spread right it's also omnidirectional< omnidirectional now instead of a shot omnidirectional now instead of a shot put< put it is a shot put spread with a long put it is a shot put spread with a long put< put spread so you use the short put put spread so you use the short put spread< spread to finance the long put spread so spread to finance the long put spread so in< in this case again another example let's in this case again another example let's say< say if you sell this for two dollars say if you sell this for two dollars your< your shot put spread then you want your your shot put spread then you want your long< long put spread to be less than two long put spread to be less than two dollars< dollars and let's say maybe one dollar dollars and let's say maybe one dollar fifty< fifty cents or maybe if you want more fifty cents or maybe if you want more credit< credit up front maybe you can just sell credit up front maybe you can just sell it< it for a dollar right it's up to you to it for a dollar right it's up to you to really< really change around with the strikes really change around with the strikes right< right so why is it good for income right so why is it good for income Generation< Generation Well because again it has Generation Well because again it has very< very extremely high win rate there's very extremely high win rate there's also< also no risk to the upside and again as also no risk to the upside and again as you< you can see it is pretty much the same you can see it is pretty much the same as< as a put ratio spread just that you have as a put ratio spread just that you have this< this long put at the end to protect your this long put at the end to protect your max< max risk so it makes more as the market max risk so it makes more as the market goes< goes down and your max risk is kept as goes down and your max risk is kept as well< well so in case of a market crash you well so in case of a market crash you don't< don't have to worry and this is good for don't have to worry and this is good for beginners< beginners so as you can see the put beginners so as you can see the put ratio< ratio spread is very similar to the put ratio spread is very similar to the put broken< broken wing butterfly it's just that you broken wing butterfly it's just that you may< may have a slightly lesser win rate may have a slightly lesser win rate compared< compared to the put ratio spread because compared to the put ratio spread because with< with the put ratio spread you don't have with the put ratio spread you don't have a< a long put you do not have to you know a long put you do not have to you know pay< pay money to buy it back right by the pay money to buy it back right by the put< put spread at the bottom put spread at the bottom so< so that's why you will generally have a so that's why you will generally have a bigger< bigger profit tent right so for the put bigger profit tent right so for the put ratio< ratio spread just go ahead and watch ratio spread just go ahead and watch some< some of the videos I have on my Channel some of the videos I have on my Channel about< about the put ratio spread you will you about the put ratio spread you will you will< will see what I'm talking about with the will see what I'm talking about with the tent< tent right so basically with the put tent right so basically with the put ratio< ratio spread you can have a bigger tent ratio spread you can have a bigger tent compared< compared to the put broken wing compared to the put broken wing butterfly< butterfly all right guys so these are butterfly all right guys so these are the< the three strategies for income the three strategies for income generation< generation or rather the six strategies generation or rather the six strategies three< three or which are the undefined risk three or which are the undefined risk strategies< strategies and three of them are the strategies and three of them are the defined< defined risk strategies by the way if defined risk strategies by the way if you< you like this video then you're you like this video then you're absolutely< absolutely going to love this next video absolutely going to love this next video

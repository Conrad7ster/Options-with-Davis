======================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you in my I'm going to be sharing with you in my humble< humble opinion what I think is the humble opinion what I think is the fastest< fastest way to become profitable trading fastest way to become profitable trading options< options especially if you're a beginner options especially if you're a beginner right< right so if you're just starting out right so if you're just starting out trading< trading options or maybe you have been trading options or maybe you have been trading< trading options for under a year then I trading options for under a year then I do< do think that the fastest way for you to do think that the fastest way for you to become< become profitable when it comes to become profitable when it comes to options< options trading would be to trade what options trading would be to trade what is< is called omnidirectional option is called omnidirectional option strategies< strategies so what exactly are strategies so what exactly are omnidirectional< omnidirectional strategies so omnidirectional strategies so omnidirectional< omnidirectional strategies have a few omnidirectional strategies have a few common< common characteristics right so first of common characteristics right so first of all< all omnidirectional strategies basically all omnidirectional strategies basically can< can profit regardless of Market can profit regardless of Market direction< direction right so the market can go up direction right so the market can go up the< the market can go sideways the market the market can go sideways the market can< can go down and there can still be an can go down and there can still be an opportunity< opportunity for the strategy to still opportunity for the strategy to still make< make money so the next one is that it make money so the next one is that it has< has a very very wide profit Zone and has a very very wide profit Zone and when< when I mean wide profit Zone I mean that when I mean wide profit Zone I mean that it< it can be even wider than the strangle it can be even wider than the strangle or< or the iron Condor right so for those of or the iron Condor right so for those of you< you who are very familiar with trading you who are very familiar with trading the< the iron Condor the strangles you will the iron Condor the strangles you will know< know that they actually do have a wide know that they actually do have a wide profit< profit Zone but when it comes to profit Zone but when it comes to omnidirectional< omnidirectional strategies we're omnidirectional strategies we're actually< actually talking about an even wider actually talking about an even wider profit< profit Zone and one of the main profit Zone and one of the main characteristics< characteristics of such strategies is characteristics of such strategies is that< that it only has risk to one side right that it only has risk to one side right so< so for example if you choose an so for example if. you choose an omnidirectional< omnidirectional stre strategy that has omnidirectional stre strategy that has no< no risk to the upside that means no risk to the upside that means regardless< regardless where the market Ries to regardless where the market Ries to right< right it can go all the way to the Moon right it can go all the way to the Moon you< you do not have to worry because it's you do not have to worry because it's still< still going to be profitable and if you still going to be profitable and if you choose< choose an omnidirectional strategy that choose an omnidirectional strategy that has< has you know RIS to the upside then if has you know RIS to the upside then if the< the market keeps going down no matter the market keeps going down no matter how< how far it goes down right if the market how far it goes down right if the market crashes< crashes you still do not have to worry crashes you still do not have to worry because< because it's still going to be in a because it's still going to be in a profit< profit and it usually is a combination profit and it usually is a combination of< of Premium selling and premium buying of Premium selling and premium buying buying< buying strategies but it's a net credit buying strategies but it's a net credit overall< overall so it is a premium selling overall so it is a premium selling strategy< strategy and finally it has to have more strategy and finally it has to have more than< than an 80% win rate right in fact in than an 80% win rate right in fact in many< many cases it can even have like a 90 many cases it can even have like a 90 odd< odd per win rate so these are the odd per win rate so these are the characteristics< characteristics of omni directional characteristics of omni directional strategies< strategies so what exactly are the strategies so what exactly are the option< option strategies that actually have all option strategies that actually have all these< these characteristics well here are a these characteristics well here are a few< few examples by the way if you like this few examples by the way if you like this video< video so far Please Subscribe and also video so far Please Subscribe and also click< click the thumbs up button and also do click the thumbs up button and also do get< get your free copy of the options income get your free copy of the options income blueprint< blueprint where I share the top three blueprint where I share the top three options< options strategies that help you options strategies that help you generate< generate a consistent income each month generate a consistent income each month trading< trading just one to 2

on over to options with davis. com< davis.

com blueprint all right back to davis. com blueprint all right back to the< the video and the very first example is the video and the very first example is What's< What's called the ratio spread right so What's called the ratio spread right so for< for the ratio spread you have the put for the ratio spread you have the put ratio< ratio spread or the call ratio spread so ratio spread or the call ratio spread so for< for this example I'm just going to use for this example I'm just going to use the< the put so the call sign is pretty much the put so the call sign is pretty much just< just the opposite right is just on the just the opposite right is just on the call< call side so for the put ratio spread as call side so for the put ratio spread as you< you can see down here on the chart it you can see down here on the chart it consists< consists of two short puts over here and consists of two short puts over here and then< then one long put now if you think about then one long put now if you think about it< it if you were to break up this two it if you were to break up this two short< short puts it's actually what you're short puts it's actually what you're getting< getting is you have one short putut that getting is you have one short putut that is< is actually financing this long put is actually financing this long put spread< spread right so when you sell this uh spread right so when you sell this uh put< put option the credit which you. have is put option the credit which you have is used< used to purchase this debit spread down used to purchase this debit spread down here< here right you have a debit spread that here right you have a debit spread that is< is a one long put and one short put and is a one long put and one short put and then< then you have one additional short putut then you have one additional short putut so< so the important thing down here is that so the important thing down here is that when< when you are buying this debit spread when you are buying this debit spread the< the put debit spread you want to ensure the put debit spread you want to ensure that< that the amount that you purchase it for that the amount that you purchase it for is< is going to be lesser than the credit is going to be lesser than the credit you< you got for the short put right so let's you got for the short put right so let's say< say for example you sell one short put say for example you sell one short put and< and the short put roughly gives you and the short put roughly gives you let's< let's say $2 in terms of credit then let's say $2 in terms of credit then what< what that means is that you have roughly what that means is that you have roughly $2< $2 credit to actually purchase your this $2 credit to actually purchase your this put< put debit spread right so let's say you put debit spread right so let's say you purchase< purchase the put debit spread for $1.

50 purchase the put debit spread for $1. 50 so< so if you purchase it for $1.

50 then so if you purchase it for $1. 50 then what< what you have down here as a net is a 50 what you have down here as a net is a 50 cents< cents credit right so 50 cents credit cents credit right so 50 cents credit just< just means that you're receiving roughly just means that you're receiving roughly $50< $50 in terms of your premium Upfront for $50 in terms of your premium Upfront for putting< putting on this strategy so if the putting on this strategy so if the market< market goes all the way up at the very market goes all the way up at the very least< least you can still be able to make you least you can still be able to make you know< know this minimum credit so generally know this minimum credit so generally for< for the put rate spread the two short for the put rate spread the two short puts< puts are together right so if you were puts are together right so if you were to< to take a look at the p&amp;l graph it will to take a look at the p&amp;l graph it will look< look something like this so if you see look. something like this so if you see this< this uh tip of this tent down here so this uh tip of this tent down here so this< this triangular shape down here from this triangular shape down here from this< this point to here I call this the tent this point to here I call this the tent right< right so for this tent if you take a right so for this tent if you take a look< look at the Apex of this tent the tip of look at the Apex of this tent the tip of this< this tent this is where your two short this tent this is where your two short puts< puts are right your two puts down here puts are right your two puts down here and< and then you have one additional put and then you have one additional put over< over here so this is plus one put so as over here so this is plus one put so as you< you can see down here it has a pretty you can see down here it has a pretty high< high win rate it has roughly high win rate it has roughly 85.

9< 85. 9 3% win rate so you can see that 85.

9 3% win rate so you can see that this< this is where the current market price this is where the current market price is< is right this is where the current is right this is where the current market< market price is so if the market goes up market price is so if the market goes up you< you still make the minimum of this uh you still make the minimum of this uh whole< whole strategy that you sold it for so whole strategy that you sold it for so in< in the example which I gave you earlier in the example which I gave you earlier there< there will be 50 cents credit which is there will be 50 cents credit which is $50< $50 and if the market goes down you $50 and if the market goes down you still< still have an opportunity to actually still have an opportunity to actually make< make more than the minimum credit if it make more than the minimum credit if it actually< actually comes down to this 10th area actually comes down to this 10th area down< down here right this tenth area down down here right this tenth area down here< here is where you get you know much more here is where you get you know much more profits< profits than this minimum profit Zone profits than this minimum profit Zone depending< depending on where it is at expiration depending on where it is at expiration so< so this is the put ratio spread now for so this is the put ratio spread now for the< the put ratio spread you can actually the put ratio spread you can actually change< change it however you want it to right change it however you want it to right like< like for example if you want a bigger like for example if you want a bigger tent< tent then you can actually construct one tent then you can actually construct one with< with a bigger tent so you can see right with a bigger tent so you can see right now< now this tent is so much bigger so Al now this tent is so much bigger so Al you< you have a wider Max profit Zone but you have a wider Max profit Zone but it's< it's a trade-off the trade-off is that it's a trade-off the trade-off is that you< you get lesser credit up front right so you get lesser credit up front right so this< this is just a trade-off if you get a this is just a trade-off if you get a lesser< lesser credit up front it means you can lesser credit up front it means you can get< get a bigger tent and this actually also get a bigger tent and this actually also increases< increases your win rate right it increases your win rate right it increases< increases your win rate mainly because increases your win rate mainly because you< you notice that with a bigger tent you you notice that with a bigger tent you actually< actually push back your break even price actually push back your break even price whereas< whereas for a smaller tent let me just whereas for a smaller tent let me just remove< remove the drawing here with a smaller remove the drawing here with a smaller tent< tent your break even will be slightly tent your break even will be slightly Clos< Clos closer right so that is why you Clos closer right so that is why you know< know it's important for you to just you know it's important for you to just you know< know Tinker around with the strikes to know Tinker around with the strikes to see< see you know which one are you more see you know which one are you more comfortable< comfortable with do you want one with comfortable with do you want one with you< you know more credit UPF front so this you know more credit UPF front so this way< way you know if the market goes up does way you know if the market goes up does not< not come down then you're going to get not come down then you're going to get more< more premium but if you're more more premium but if you're more protective< protective and you're afraid that you protective and you're afraid that you know< know the market crashes or you know have know the market crashes or you know have a< a very steep Decline and you want a a very steep Decline and you want a larger< larger profit Zone then you might want larger profit Zone then you might want to< to go for one that has a wider tent down to go for one that has a wider tent down here< here so this wider tent will give you a here so this wider tent will give you a higher< higher win rate and a higher Max profit higher win rate and a higher Max profit if< if you manage to pin this short strike if you manage to pin this short strike at< at expiration but the trade-off again is at expiration but the trade-off again is that< that you notice that your minimum profit that you notice that your minimum profit or< or rather your credit that you receive or rather your credit that you receive for< for selling this whole put ratio spread for selling this whole put ratio spread is< is going to be much much lesser again is going to be much much lesser again there's< there's no right or wrong it really there's no right or wrong it really comes< comes down to your outlook and what is comes down to your outlook and what is it< it that you want for your you know it that you want for your you know trading< trading in terms of trading your options trading in terms of trading your options now< now there's another way that you can now there's another way that you can actually< actually construct this put ratio spread actually construct this put ratio spread you< you can actually split up your short you can actually split up your short putut< putut so remember this ratio spread is putut so remember this ratio spread is where< where you have a short putut that where you have a short putut that finances< finances a long put spread so you can finances a long put spread so you can actually< actually sell your short putut that is actually sell your short putut that is below< below this long put spread so for below this long put spread so for example< example you can see over here this is uh example you can see over here this is uh one< one short put down here then you have one short put down here then you have another< another short putut down here and then another short putut down here and then you< you have this uh long put down here so you have this uh long put down here so and< and this will be + one put so as you can and this will be + one put so as you can see< see the structure on the right hand side see the structure on the right hand side here< here here this will be your put debit here here this will be your put debit spread< spread and then you're using this short spread and then you're using this short put< put down here to finance your put debit put down here to finance your put debit spread< spread so when you do it this way you spread so when you do it this way you have< have a slightly different structure than have a slightly different structure than if< if you were to you know put both short if you were to you know put both short puts< puts together now the next example is puts together now the next example is what< what is called the broken wing butterfly what is called the broken wing butterfly so< so again I'm just using the put as an so again I'm just using the put as an example< example down here the call is just the example down here the call is just the opposite< opposite so for the put broking opposite so for the put broking butterfly< butterfly down here you notice that the butterfly down here you notice that the structure< structure above down here is. the same as structure above down here is the same as the< the put ratio spread right the only the put ratio spread right the only difference< difference is that you add one difference is that you add one additional< additional long put at the bottom right additional long put at the bottom right so< so this is where you actually Define so this is where you actually Define your< your risk so in this case if the market your risk so in this case if the market you< you know crashes all the way down below you know crashes all the way down below this< this long put you don't really have to this long put you don't really have to worry< worry because your max loss has already worry because your max loss has already been< been kept to this point down here so for been kept to this point down here so for the< the put broken wing butterfly it's the put broken wing butterfly it's pretty< pretty much just a short putut spread pretty much just a short putut spread that< that is financing a long put spread so that is financing a long put spread so for< for the put ratio spread you have a for the put ratio spread you have a short< short putut that finances the long putut short putut that finances the long putut spread< spread whereas for the the broken wing spread whereas for the the broken wing butterfly< butterfly you have a short put spread butterfly you have a short put spread that< that is financing a long put spread so that is financing a long put spread so as< as you can see it's pretty similar right as you can see it's pretty similar right the< the principle is pretty much the same the principle is pretty much the same you're< you're just using a credit strategy to you're just using a credit strategy to purchase< purchase a debit strategy so if you were purchase a debit strategy so if you were to< to take a look at the uh p&amp;l graph down to take a look at the uh p&amp;l graph down here< here you will also see that the win rate here you will also see that the win rate is< is actually also pretty high right about is actually also pretty high right about 87%< 87% and this is how the broken wing 87% and this is how the broken wing butterfly< butterfly look like right so this is butterfly look like right so this is where< where the current market price is so if where the current market price is so if the< the market goes all the way up you just the market goes all the way up you just get< get the minimum credit that you sold get the minimum credit that you sold this< this whole structure for and if it goes this whole structure for and if it goes down< down if let's say for example it stays down if let's say for example it stays somewhere< somewhere within this 10 at expiration somewhere within this 10 at expiration then< then you have the opportunity to make then you have the opportunity to make much< much more than the minimum credit right much more than the minimum credit right and< and all the way to the downside down and all the way to the downside down here< here this is where you have your long here this is where you have your long put< put so this put down here actually helps put so this put down here actually helps you< you protect your position in case you you protect your position in case you know< know the market goes all the way to zero know the market goes all the way to zero so< so this is where you have a kept Max so this is where you have a kept Max loss< loss for this trade so if you do not loss for this trade so if you do not have< have a very big B capital to put on the have a very big B capital to put on the put< put ratio spread then you want to put ratio spread then you want to consider< consider the broken wing butterfly in consider the broken wing butterfly in this< this case now the next example of an this case now the next example of an omnidirectional< omnidirectional option strategy is what omnidirectional option strategy is what is< is called the skew Condor now I don't is called the skew Condor now I don't want< want you to get too confused by the name want you to get too confused by the name because< because it's actually just a variation because it's actually just a variation of< of the broken wing butterfly right if of the broken wing butterfly right if you< you notice for the broken wing butterfly you notice for the broken wing butterfly basically< basically you have two short puts at one basically you have two short puts at one place< place so for the put Condor is pretty place so for the put Condor is pretty much< much you're just splitting up these two much you're just splitting up these two short< short puts right so if I was to go to short puts right so if I was to go to the< the Chart down here you notice that the the Chart down here you notice that the short< short putut now has been split up right short putut now has been split up right instead< instead of having two short puts at one instead of having two short puts at one strike< strike you have the short puts at strike you have the short puts at different< different strikes right so the one at different strikes right so the one at the< the bottom down here is the put credit the bottom down here is the put credit spread< spread so you have the short putut spread so you have the short putut spread< spread again financing the long put spread again financing the long put spread< spread so one thing you'll notice with spread so one thing you'll notice with such< such kind of structures is that your such kind of structures is that your long< long put spread the width tends to be long put spread the width tends to be very< very much smaller than the width of your very much smaller than the width of your credit< credit spread right the put credit credit spread right the put credit spread< spread and the reason is because you spread and the reason is because you need< need to purchase a put debit spread need to purchase a put debit spread within< within the uh credit that's given to you within the uh credit that's given to you right< right so if the credit down here is $2 right so if the credit down here is $2 you< you cannot purchase anything that is you cannot purchase anything that is more< more than $2 otherwise this whole more than $2 otherwise this whole structure< structure will be a debit so the only structure will be a debit so the only way< way for you to actually purchase a put way for you to actually purchase a put debit< debit spread that is closer to where the debit spread that is closer to where the current< current market price is is that you need current market price is is that you need to< to find a put deit spread that has a to find a put deit spread that has a smaller< smaller width so that's the only way smaller width so that's the only way that< that you can actually construct this that you can actually construct this whole< whole uh strategy that has an overall whole uh strategy that has an overall credit< credit so this way you know if the credit so this way you know if the market< market goes all the way up then there's market goes all the way up then there's no< no risk whatsoever but if you were to no risk whatsoever but if you were to purchase< purchase a debit spread that is more purchase a debit spread that is more than< than this $2 that's given to you so than this $2 that's given to you so let's< let's say you purchase one that is let's say you purchase one that is $2. 50< $2.

50 then what it just means is that if $2. 50 then what it just means is that if the< the market goes up then you will have a the market goes up then you will have a loss< loss of 50 cents or $50 so this is the loss of 50 cents or $50 so this is the fundamental< fundamental of how we actually construct fundamental of how we actually construct such< such omnidirectional option strategies such omnidirectional option strategies when< when you you know you're using one of when you you know you're using one of the< the credit side to finance the debit the credit side to finance the debit side< side so if you were to take a look at side so if you were to take a look at the< the p&amp;l graph you notice there's the p&amp;l graph you notice there's actually< actually some similarities with the uh actually some similarities with the uh put< put ratio spread which I showed you put ratio spread which I showed you earlier< earlier where I basically just split up earlier where I basically just split up the< the put options right the short put the put options right the short put options< options so if you think about it it's options so if you think about it it's actually< actually the same right the only actually the same right the only difference< difference is that there's one difference is that there's one additional< additional long put down here for the additional long put down here for the put< put Condor and that defines your maximum put Condor and that defines your maximum BRD< BRD so again for the skute Condor you BRD so again for the skute Condor you will< will also have a pretty high win rate will also have a pretty high win rate and< and your win rate really is determined and your win rate really is determined by< by where you place this short putut down by where you place this short putut down here< here so the further away you put this here so the further away you put this short< short putut the higher the win rate short putut the higher the win rate right< right so if you put this further away right so if you put this further away you< you get a higher win rate but at the you get a higher win rate but at the same< same time you also get lesser credit so same time you also get lesser credit so if< if you get lesser credit then it means if you get lesser credit then it means that< that your this put debit spread might be that your this put debit spread might be much< much smaller or you may have to buy a much smaller or you may have to buy a put< put debit spread that is further out of put debit spread that is further out of the< the money as well rather than you know the money as well rather than you know just< just below where this current market just below where this current market price< price is so again when you're putting on price is so again when you're putting on such< such strategies is very important for such strategies is very important for you< you to just Tinker around with the you to just Tinker around with the strikes< strikes just shift it back and forth to strikes just shift it back and forth to find< find a structure that you feel find a structure that you feel comfortable< comfortable with now one quick tick I comfortable with now one quick tick I want< want to kind of give you is regarding want to kind of give you is regarding the< the name condor so you notice that this the name condor so you notice that this name< name condor is very similar to the one name condor is very similar to the one that's< that's called the iron Condor right so that's called the iron Condor right so one< one tip to give you is that whenever you one tip to give you is that whenever you hear< hear the word iron it. means that there hear the word iron it means that there is< is a combination of put and calls right is a combination of put and calls right so< so iron Condors consist of a sh put so iron Condors consist of a sh put spread< spread and a short call spread whereas spread and a short call spread whereas for< for the Condor is usually only using for the Condor is usually only using either< either all puts or either all calls so either all puts or either all calls so similarly< similarly for the iron fly and the similarly for the iron fly and the Butterfly< Butterfly right so for the iron fly you Butterfly right so for the iron fly you have< have both the call option and the put have both the call option and the put option< option whereas for the butterfly you option whereas for the butterfly you just< just simply have either the put or the just simply have either the put or the call< call now the next example of an call now the next example of an omnidirectional< omnidirectional option strategies is omnidirectional option strategies is what< what is called the Jade lizard now the what is called the Jade lizard now the Jade< Jade lizard is slightly different from Jade lizard is slightly different from the< the other strategies that I've shown you the other strategies that I've shown you and< and the difference is that for the Jade and the difference is that for the Jade lizard< lizard you notice there's actually two lizard you notice there's actually two credit< credit strategies combined together credit strategies combined together whereas< whereas for the other strategies that whereas for the other strategies that I've< I've shown you so far it usually I've shown you so far it usually consists< consists of a credit strategy and using consists of a credit strategy and using that< that credit to finance you know the that credit to finance you know the purchase< purchase of a debit strategy but for the purchase of a debit strategy but for the G< G lizard it's actually two credit G lizard it's actually two credit strategies< strategies so you can see down here you strategies so you can see down here you have< have a short put and then a short call have a short put and then a short call spread< spread so the main thing down here that spread so the main thing down here that you< you want to take note of is this call you want to take note of is this call spread< spread down here right it's very spread down here right it's very important< important that when you construct the important that when you construct the Jade< Jade lizard you want this call spread Jade lizard you want this call spread the< the width to be actually smaller than the width to be actually smaller than the< the total credit that you receive for the total credit that you receive for this< this structure so if you're familiar this structure so if you're familiar with< with trading call spreads then the max with trading call spreads then the max loss< loss of a call spread is simply the loss of a call spread is simply the width< width of this call spread minus whatever width of this call spread minus whatever premium< premium that you get so let's say for premium that you get so let's say for example< example if this call spread is $2 and example if this call spread is $2 and let's< let's say for this whole Jade lizard let's say for this whole Jade lizard structure< structure you get structure you get $250< $250 then what it means is that if the $250 then what it means is that if the market< market goes all the way up here then market goes all the way up here then first< first of all your loss on this call first of all your loss on this call spread< spread will be $2 but because you spread will be $2 but because you already< already received $2.

50 up front for this already received $2. 50 up front for this whole< whole structure then you actually have a whole structure then you actually have a spillover< spillover of a positive 50 cents right spillover of a positive 50 cents right so< so that'll be $50 so this way if the so that'll be $50 so this way if the market< market goes past your call spread you market goes past your call spread you still< still are profitable so if you were to still are profitable so if you were to take< take a look at the p&amp;l graph of this J take a look at the p&amp;l graph of this J lizard< lizard you notice that it's actually lizard you notice that it's actually somewhat< somewhat similar to the put ratio spread somewhat similar to the put ratio spread so< so if you were to go back to the put so if you were to go back to the put ratio< ratio spread you will notice that it is ratio spread you will notice that it is a< a pretty similar structure right you a pretty similar structure right you have< have a tent that is rather flat and then have a tent that is rather flat and then you< you have this side where you know as the you have this side where you know as the market< market goes down you keep losing more market goes down you keep losing more and< and more money right so both of them are and more money right so both of them are undefined< undefined R strategies because of the undefined R strategies because of the short< short put now the difference between the short put now the difference between the put< put ratio spread and the Jade lizard is put ratio spread and the Jade lizard is basically< basically where you have this spread basically where you have this spread down< down here right so for the put ratio down here right so for the put ratio spread< spread is a put debit spread whereas for spread is a put debit spread whereas for the< the J lizard is a call Credit spread the the J lizard is a call Credit spread the difference< difference is where you place it with difference is where you place it with regards< regards to where the current market regards to where the current market price< price is so you can see down here this price is so you can see down here this is< is where the current market price is so is where the current market price is so usually< usually for the put ratio spread your usually for the put ratio spread your put< put debit

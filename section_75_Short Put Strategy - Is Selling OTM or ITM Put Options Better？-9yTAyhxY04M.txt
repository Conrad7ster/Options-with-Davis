Language: en hey< hey guys davis here so welcome to hey guys davis here so welcome to another< another video so in this video i want to another video so in this video i want to talk< talk about whether you should be selling talk about whether you should be selling out< out of the money put options or in the out of the money put options or in the money< money put options all right so first of money put options all right so first of all< all. let's define what is out of the all let's define what is out of the money< money and what is in the money so out of money and what is in the money so out of the< the money is very simply when your short the money is very simply when your short put< put strike is below the current strike put strike is below the current strike price< price so for example if the current price so for example if the current strike< strike price right now is 79. 62 strike price right now is 79.

62 so< so any strike price that is below this so any strike price that is below this will< will be considered and out of the money will be considered and out of the money. put< put okay and the delta is normally is put okay and the delta is normally is always< always by the way it's always less than always by the way it's always less than 0. 5< 0.

5 right 0. 5 is at the money that means 0.

5 right 0. 5 is at the money that means it's< it's at this price down here it's at this price. down here anything< anything below that will be lesser than anything below that will be lesser than 0.

5 0. 5 0.

5 now< now what about in the money now in the now what about in the money now in the money< money uh put options are basically the money. uh put options are basically the opposite< opposite so they are anything that is opposite so they are anything that is above< above the current stock price of 79. 62 above the current stock price of 79.

62 so< so in this case would be 82. 5 85 and so in this case would be 82.

5 85 and your< your delta is above 0. 5 all right so your delta is above 0.

5 all right so very< very simple enough very simple enough now< now let's take a look at the main now let's take a look at the main difference< difference between out of the money difference between out of the money put< put options and in the money put options put options and in the money put options and< and the main difference is really and the main difference is really extrinsic< extrinsic and intrinsic value now extrinsic and intrinsic value now extrinsic< extrinsic value if you're not already extrinsic value if you're not already familiar familiar familiar basically< basically it's just time value so you basically. it's just time value so you can< can see this is the column down here so can see this is the column down here so this< this tells you the the value of the this tells you the the value of the extrinsic< extrinsic value for each of this strike extrinsic value for each of this strike down< down here okay so if you take a look at down here okay so if you take a look at the< the 79 strike the 79 strike it< it says that it has a an extrinsic value it says that it has a an extrinsic value of< of 3. 575 of 3.

#### Topic 1

575 and< and if you will take a look at the out and if you will take a look at the out of< of the money on the other extreme of the money on the other extreme seventy< seventy dollars it has an extrinsic seventy dollars it has an extrinsic value< value of one dollars one dollars and value of one dollars one dollars and eight< eight cents eight cents and< and on the other hand if you go deep in and on the other hand if you go deep in the< the money the money all< all right 90 all right 90 you< you would see that there is very little you would see that there is very little extrinsic< extrinsic value extrinsic value okay< okay so if you notice this is like a okay so if you notice this is like a bell< bell curve right. you get the most bell curve right you get the most extrinsic< extrinsic value extrinsic value right< right at the money and then it starts to right at the money and then it starts to drop< drop off drop off uh< uh at the both ends uh at the both ends so< so this is extrinsic value so this is extrinsic value now< now intrinsic value now intrinsic value is< is just the difference between the is just the difference between the current< current stock price and the strike price current stock price and the strike price so< so let's just do a quick calculation so let's just do a quick calculation here< here to see what i mean here to see what i mean so< so you can see right here that the so you can see right here that the current< current stock price is 79. 62 current stock price is 79.

62 and< and down here you can see an intrinsic and down here you can see an intrinsic value< value of value of 38< 38 cents so 38 cents so let's< let's. calculate this so you take the let's calculate this so you take the strike< strike price down here you take 80 strike price down here you take 80 minus minus minus 79. 62< 79.

62 which is the current price 79. 62 which is the current price and< and you get yourself 38 cents as you can and you get yourself 38 cents as you can see< see it's exactly what i stated here so see it's exactly what i stated here so this< this is exactly just the intrinsic price this is exactly just the intrinsic price right< right intrinsic value is just the right intrinsic value is just the difference< difference between the stock price and difference between the stock price and the< the strike price which also means that. the strike price which also means that this< this is the value that you will make if this is the value that you will make if the< the market was to go up by the amount so the market was to go up by the amount so for< for example for example if< if the market was to go up to if the market was to go up to 80< 80 or sorry from right now 79 go up to 80 or sorry from right now 79 go up to say< 5.

38< 5. 38 is the money that you make because 5.

38 is the money that you make because when< when it moves five dollars this five when it moves five dollars this five dollars< dollars three three five dollars and 38 dollars three three five dollars and 38 cents< cents will become zero because there's cents will become zero because there's now< now no longer any intrinsic value and now no longer any intrinsic value and that< that is the amount that you will make so that is the. amount that you will make so this< this is why some people want to sell in this is why some people want to sell in the< the money put option is because you can the money put option is because you can actually< actually make the profits of capital actually make the profits of capital gains< gains so it's very similar to just gains so it's very similar to just buying< buying a stock at buying a stock at 79. 62 79.

62 79. 62 and< and then when it reaches 85 you just and then when it reaches 85 you just sell< sell the stock if you sell the stock sell the stock if you sell the stock you'll< you'll be making five dollars 38 cents you'll be making five dollars 38 cents so< so this is what uh so this is what uh intrinsic< intrinsic value also has so intrinsic value also has so all< all of the money is basically 100 all of the money is basically 100 extrinsic< extrinsic value this is just time value extrinsic value this is just time value it< it will decay the moment uh it will decay the moment uh it< it ultimately will go to zero once 40 it ultimately will go to zero once 40 days< days is up as you can see this is the days is up as you can see this is the days< days to expiration days to expiration but< but if it was to make a very quick move but if it was to make a very quick move let's< let's see if if it's for some reason it let's see if if it's for some reason it would< would to rally all the way to 90 would to rally all the way to 90 you< you would not make the full like 10 on you would not make the full like 10 on this< this you would only make whatever you this you would only make whatever you sold< sold down here right sold down here right depending< depending on how fast it took to get to depending. on how fast it took to get to 90< 90 dollars 90 dollars now< now on the other hand in the money now on the other hand in the money options< options is a mix of extrinsic value and options is a mix of extrinsic value and intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value so< so you can see these two columns down so you can see these two columns down here here here there's< there's a mix of both of them there's a mix of both of them so so so i< i want you to just imagine right now i want you to just imagine right now uh< uh we are shot the 75 strikes so we want uh we are shot the 75 strikes so we want to< to know exactly how much extrinsic value to know exactly how much extrinsic value it< it actually decays it actually decays if< if the market was to move if the market was to move in< in the day itself right let's say if the in the day itself right let's say if the move move move uh uh uh number< number of uh points in one day how much number of uh points in one day how much extrinsic< extrinsic value does does it decay in extrinsic value does does it decay in one< one day one day so< so the way to do that let's just do a so the way to do that let's just do a simulation< simulation that we will be selling the simulation that we will be selling the 75< 75 strike right right now it's 79.

62 and 75 strike right right now it's 79. 62 and let's< let's just assume that today itself let's just assume that today itself after< after we have sold the market has moved. after we have sold the market has moved up< up five dollars right five points to up five dollars right five points to 84.

62 84. 62 84.

62 so< so that means so that means your< your out of the money option your out of the money option would< would have become even more out of the would have become even more out of the money< money because now the market has moved. money because now the market has moved up< up right up right so< so what happens to this extrinsic value so what happens to this extrinsic value so< so this extrinsic value will basically so this extrinsic value will basically decay< decay to decay to 1. 85< 1.

#### Topic 2

85 cents so it decayed from 1. 85 cents so it decayed from so< so it reduced the value from two dollars so it reduced the value from two dollars and< and 19 cents and 19 cents all< all the way to one dollar and eight cent all the way to one dollar and eight cent in< in just one day right on this day itself in just one day right on this day itself you< you can see this is the value that means you can see this is the value that means your< your delta gone from 30 to 17 deltas so your delta gone from 30 to 17 deltas so that< that is about that is about a< a dollars and a dollars and 11< 11 cents one dollars and 11 cents 11 cents one dollars and 11 cents right right right so< so here's the thing right so here's the thing right if< if you're selling out the money if you're selling out the money uh< uh put option 75 on the. day itself made uh put option 75 on the day itself made a< a big move a big move you< you only made a dollar eleven cents you only made a dollar eleven cents right< right it moved five points you made a right it moved five points you made a dollar< dollar eleven cents dollar eleven cents now< now what if we compare this to an in the now what if we compare this to an in the money< money put option money put option so< so let's say now instead we sold the 84 so let's say now instead we sold the 84 strike strike strike so< so the 84 strike consists of both so the 84 strike consists of both intrinsic< intrinsic and extrinsic value so let's intrinsic and extrinsic value so let's just< just calculate the total value that we just calculate the total value that we will< will get by selling this option will get by selling this option so< so you take 4.

38 intrinsic value and so you take 4. 38 intrinsic value and then< then you add 2.

12 then you add 2. 12 okay< okay so you make i mean you sold this okay so you make i mean you sold this for< for six dollars and 50 cents so same for six dollars and 50 cents so same thing< thing again thing again let's< let's say let's say today today today on< on the same day itself it moved five on the same day itself it moved five points< points right so if it moved five points points right so if it moved five points so< so same thing your in the money put so same thing your in the money put option< option will now become at the money or option will now become at the money or become< become out of the money right so what become out of the money right so what happens< happens to the intrinsic and extrinsic happens to the intrinsic and extrinsic value< value so if you were to see value so if you were to see the< the intrinsic value the intrinsic value we< we immediately we immediately made< made this amount became zero right we made this amount became zero right we made< made four dollars and 38 cents which is made. four dollars and 38 cents which is 438< 438 dollars 438 dollars but but but if< if you will take a look at the extrinsic if you will take a look at the extrinsic value value value it< it actually didn't decay it actually didn't decay it< it actually increased remember because it actually increased remember because this< this is the bell curve this is the bell curve so< so the in the money put option will so the in the money put option will immediately< immediately make this immediately make this intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value but< but your extrinsic value will gain a but your extrinsic value will gain a little< little bit little bit right< right but from here on it will start to right but from here on it will start to decay so< so how much did you make on this five so how much did you make on this five dollars< dollars move dollars move up< up right if you move five dollars up up right if you move five dollars up the< the amount which you made which we the amount which you made which we calculated< calculated earlier calculated earlier was< was 4.

38 was 4. 38 plus< plus 2.

12 plus 2. 12 right< right you get 6.

5 and you minus off the right you get 6. 5 and you minus off the extrinsic< extrinsic value you minus of 3 point extrinsic value you minus of 3 point five< five seven five five seven five and< and that means you made two dollars and and that means you made two dollars and ninety< ninety two cents you made two dollars ninety two cents you made two dollars and< and ninety two cents here and ninety two cents here but< you< you only made one dollars you only made one dollars eleven< eleven cents eleven cents so< so which means to say your in the money so which means to say your in the money put< put option put option will< will make more will make more when< when the market really moves quickly when the market really moves quickly compared< compared to the out of the money option compared to the out of the money option so< so the time when you want to make an in so the time when you want to make an in the< the money option sorry you want to sell the money option sorry you want to sell in< in the money put option in the money put option is< is when you feel that it's going to be a is when you feel that it's going to be a big< big move because you're going to make big move because you're going to make more< more by selling in the money per option more by selling in the money per option as< as compared to selling an out of the as compared to selling an out of the money< money put option money put option okay okay okay so so so by< by the way if you've enjoyed this video by the way if you've enjoyed this video so< so far i appreciate it if you just hit so far i appreciate it if you just hit the< the subscribe button and give a thumbs the. subscribe button and give a thumbs up< up so i can create more videos like this up so i can create more videos like this for< for you in the future all right back to for you in the future all right back to the< the video the video okay< okay so let's take a look at the profit okay so let's take a look at the profit and< and loss graph for each of the put and loss graph for each of the put options< options so we will see that there is options so we will see that there is some< some trade-off between them some trade-off between them so< so this is the out of the money put so this is the out of the money put option< option you can see this is the 72 option you can see this is the 72 strikes< strikes and we'll be receiving one strikes and we'll be receiving one dollar< dollar and 45 cents for it so the dollar and 45 cents for it so the trade-off< trade-off is that for the out of money trade-off is that for the out of money put< put option there is a higher win rate put option there is a higher win rate and< and with the higher win rate it means and with the higher win rate it means it's< it's much more forgiving right you could it's much more forgiving right you could be< be wrong on the direction and then you be wrong on the direction and then you still< still could make money at the end and still could make money at the end and this< this is what it means you see this is what it means you see this< this is the this is the percentage< percentage chance percentage chance that< that you will make money on this put that you will make money on this put option< option right so 21.

7 option right so 21. 7 is is is if< if the market goes below if the market goes below the the the. break-even< break-even price you will lose money so break-even price you will lose money so you< you have 21.

7 percent chance of it you have 21. 7 percent chance of it dropping< dropping below your break even to lose dropping below your. break even to lose money< money and you have a money and you have a 78.

3< 78. 3 percent chance of making money so 78.

#### Topic 3

3 percent chance of making money so that< that is why it's much more forgiving if that is why it's much more forgiving if you< you sell the out the money put option you sell the out the money put option anywhere< anywhere the market could go this is anywhere the market could go this is where< where the current uh market price is if where the current uh market price is if the< the market was to go down but it doesn't the market was to go down but it doesn't go< go below your break-even price you would go below your break-even price you would still< still make your money at expiration still make your money at expiration and< and if it goes up the problem is that and if it goes up the problem is that you< you will have a lower profit and a lower you will have a lower profit and a lower roi< roi compared to in the. money because you roi compared to in the money because you only< only can make the maximum of your credit only can make the maximum of your credit receive< receive so in this case if you really receive so in this case if you really remember< remember when we're selling out the remember when we're selling out the money< money put option we only get extrinsic money put option we only get extrinsic value< value so we do not get any intrinsic value so we do not get any intrinsic value< value that means we don't get any value that means we don't get any capital< capital gains on the stock movement so capital gains on the stock movement so what< what is the roi which we can get for what is the roi which we can get for selling< selling this uh put option so the roi is selling this uh put option so the roi is simply< simply calculated by the premium 1. 45 simply calculated by the premium 1.

45 cents< cents and you divide it off by the cents and you divide it off by the strike strike strike which< which is 72 and divided by the number of which is 72 and divided by the number of days< days to expiration so in this. case this days to expiration so in this case this option< option is 40 days and then you times option is 40 days and then you times 365< 365 days so that is a return of roughly 365 days so that is a return of roughly 18. 37 18.

37 18. 37 which< which is not too bad but if you were to which is not too bad but if you were to compare< compare this with the in the money put compare this with the in the money put option< option all right let's just go to the in option all right let's just go to the in the< the money put option pll graph. here you the money put option pll graph here you would< would see that we would have a higher would see that we would have a higher premium< premium received premium received and< and let's just calculate the roi very and let's just calculate the roi very quickly quickly quickly so< so the ri for this would be so the ri for this would be 5.

77 5. 77 5.

77 we< we divide this by the strike price 83 we divide this by the strike price 83 and< and then we divide by 40 as well. and and then we divide by 40 as well and then< then we times then we times 365< 365 and that would give us a r of 63. 43 365 and that would give us a r of 63.

43 so< so that is more than three times the so that is more than three times the profit< profit you would make now although profit you would make now although you'll< you'll be making much more you'll be making much more all< all right you have a higher profit and a all right you have a higher profit and a higher< higher return higher return the< the thing the trade-off is that you the thing the. trade-off is that you actually< actually have a lower win rate so if you actually have a lower win rate so if you were< were to take a look at the percentage of were to take a look at the percentage of this< this two points down here this two points down here right right right so< so this is where your break-even price so this is where your break-even price is< is again you take the 5. 77 cents minus is again you take the 5.

77 cents minus off< off the strike price that is your break off the strike price that is your break even< even price even price so< so anywhere below this break-even price so anywhere below this break-even price you< you are losing money on your short put you are losing money on your short put. anyway< anyway above this you make money so as anyway above this you make money so as you< you can see you can see the< the the chances of you losing the that the the chances of you losing the that money< money right from here on is money right from here on is 44. 47< 44.

47 which is much higher than the 20 44. 47 which is much higher than the 20 something< something percent for the out of the something percent for the out of the money< money put option so what this means is money put option so what this means is that< that if you want to sell an in the money that if you want to sell an in the money put< put option put option you< you have to be pretty accurate on the you have to be pretty accurate on the direction< direction of the trade which means you direction of the trade which means you do< do want the market to go up do want the market to go up uh uh uh once< once you sell the in the money put once you sell the in the money put option< option so the question now becomes which option so the question now becomes which is< is better is out the money better or in is better is out the money better or in the< the money better and the answer is that the money better and the answer is that it< it depends on what the stock actually it depends on what the stock actually does< does after that right because if the does after that right because if the moment< moment you sell the out of the money put moment you sell the out of the money put option option option okay okay okay and< and the market all of a sudden just and the market all of a sudden just rarely< rarely is the moment you sell the out rarely is the moment you sell the out the< the money put option well then you would the money put option well then you would have< have made more money with the in the have made more money with the in the money< money put option money put option okay< okay so but on the other hand if you okay so but on the other hand if you sold< sold an in the money put option and then sold an in the money put option and then the< the market started to tank the market started to tank you< you would have a regretted selling in you would have a regretted selling in the< the money put option you wish that the money put option you wish that probably< probably you have sold out the money put probably you have sold out the money put option< option because it will give you a better option because it will give you a better chance< chance of it winning because if the chance of it winning because if the market< market was to go down market was to go down uh uh uh from< from the point you sold it it may not from the point you sold it it may not have< have gone past your strike price and if have gone past your strike price and if it< it does go past your strike price you it does go past your strike price you still< still can actually roll it down to a still can actually roll it down to a further< further strike price further strike price okay< okay so okay so it< it all comes down to your direction of it all comes down to your direction of the< the stock after you have placed the the stock after you have placed the trade< trade okay so i want you to take a look trade okay so i want you to take a look at< at this chart right here so basically at this chart right here so basically you< you see that the market is uh going down you see that the market is uh going down and< and then let's say if you were to sell. a and then let's say if you were to sell a put< put option where would you sell right put option where would you sell right would< would you sell in the money or would you would you sell in the money or would you sell< sell out of money okay so sell out of money okay so if< if you have seen my previous video where if you have seen my previous video where i< i said i sold in the money put you will i said i sold in the money put you will notice< notice uh you'll realize that i actually notice uh you'll realize that i actually sold< sold at 300 sold at 300 all< all right so most people if they were to all right so most people if they were to take< take a look at this the natural reaction take a look at this the natural reaction will< will be to sell at 270 will be to sell at 270 strike< strike price maybe even 260 dollar strike price maybe even 260 dollar strike< strike price and there's definitely strike price and there's definitely nothing< nothing wrong with that right guys nothing wrong with that right guys there's< there's nothing wrong with selling for there's nothing wrong with selling for the< the out of the money the out of the money the< the reason why i decided to sell the reason why i decided to sell the< the strike price was because i expected the strike price was because i expected a< a bounce pretty quickly a bounce pretty quickly and< and that is because i took a look at a and that is because i took a look at a few< few technicals and indicators for me to few technicals and indicators for me to decide< decide on this point decide on this point in< in the video i mentioned that i saw this in the video i mentioned that i saw this right< right so this means a lower low right so this means a lower low all< all right at the same time the indicator all right at the same time the indicator the< the store casting actually made the store casting actually made a< a higher a higher uh< uh higher low you see higher low lower uh higher low you see higher low lower low< low okay low okay at< at the same time what i saw at the same time what i saw was< was that there was a support here was that there was a support here all< all right this was the previous low and all right this was the previous low and the< the market tried to break the market tried to break break< break below this low but it couldn't and break below this low but it couldn't and then< then it went back up and closed above then it went back up and closed above here< here and forming this candlestick which here and forming this candlestick which is< is a bullish pin bar so with this is a bullish pin bar so with this bullish< bullish pin bar bullish pin bar coupled< coupled with the bullish coupled with the bullish divergence< divergence on the stochastics divergence on the stochastics i< i decided to take a a short i decided to take a a short put< put at this strike price and in the put at this strike price and in the money< money put because i expected this to go money put because i expected this to go up< up now up now i< i had at the point of time also i had at the point of time also considered< considered selling the other put options considered selling the other put options right< right at 260.

but when i take a look at right at 260. but when i take a look at the< the premium uh this 260 was at the time the premium uh this 260 was at the time if< if i'm not wrong was roughly around five if i'm not wrong was roughly around five dollars dollars dollars all< all right all right five< five dollars five dollars and< and the in the money put at 300 and the in the money put at 300 was< was going for twenty dollars was going for twenty dollars so< so in terms of uh money received this is so in terms of uh money received this is two< two thousand dollars this is five two thousand dollars this is five hundred< hundred dollars so i thought to myself hundred dollars so i thought to myself say< say that you know i could definitely say that you know i could definitely just< just sell just sell this< this and then collect this five dollars this and then collect this five dollars once< once it expires but then what if the once it expires but then what if the market< market really shot up immediately you market really shot up immediately you see< see if the market really showed up see if the market really showed up immediately< immediately which i thought it would immediately which i thought it would right right right then then then selling< selling this five dollars would be kind selling this five dollars would be kind of< of a little bit of a waste because i of a little bit of a waste because i would< would not be able to pocket this nice would not be able to pocket this nice move< move right if you moved up here i'll move right if you moved up here i'll. probably< probably you know choose to take profit probably you know choose to take profit at< at 50 at 50 that< that means i'll probably only make two that means i'll probably only make two dollars< dollars 50 cents which is 250 dollars dollars 50 cents which is 250 dollars when< when the market made such a big move when the market made such a big move so< so i decided that hey i think i want to so i decided that hey i think i want to take< take on some intrinsic value take on some intrinsic value intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value and< and some extrinsic value as well and some extrinsic value as well so< so that is how i came up with the strike so that is how i came up with the strike price< price of 300 because there was a good price of 300 because there was a good mix< mix of 10 in extrinsic value and 10 mix of 10 in extrinsic value and 10 dollars< dollars in intrinsic value dollars in intrinsic value right< right 10 dollars in intrinsic value so right 10 dollars in intrinsic value so this< this extrinsic value this extrinsic value and< and this intrinsic value and this intrinsic value so< so i thought to myself the mindset which so i thought to myself the mindset which i< i had at that point of time is that 10 i had at that point of time is that 10 is< is actually not a very big move to make is actually not a very big move to make right< right at the point of time when i shot right at the point of time when i shot the< the put the put the< the market was at 290.

#### Topic 4

at 290 i thought the market was at 290. at 290 i thought to< to myself that you see that the you see to myself that you see that the you see the< the market right the the range of each the market right the the range of each of< of the candles can easily go to about of the candles can easily go to about ten< ten dollars and this is on a daily chart ten dollars and this is on a daily chart each< each day it could make you know each day it could make you know as< as big as a 10 move as big as a 10 move so< so on the average it could be around so on the average it could be around five< five dollars more five to seven dollars five dollars more five to seven dollars so< so i told myself that if the market is so i told myself that if the market is really< really going to bounce it probably going really going to bounce it probably going to< to bounce in the next few days so if to bounce in the next few days so if it's< it's going to bounce the next few days it's going to bounce the next few days 300< 300 dollars is definitely not a very 300 dollars is definitely not a very difficult< difficult target to achieve difficult target to achieve so< so i wanted to so i wanted to get< get this full 10 dollars in terms of get this full 10 dollars in terms of intrinsic< intrinsic value and i decided on intrinsic value and i decided on extrinsic< extrinsic value of 10 as well because i extrinsic value of 10 as well because i thought< thought that maybe you know there could thought that maybe you know there could be< be a chance that i'm wrong be a chance that i'm wrong let's< let's say if i'm wrong but i was still let's say if i'm wrong but i was still confident< confident it will get up to 300 confident it will get up to 300 it< it could take time right so it may be it it could take time right so it may be it could< could do this for some time could do this for some time before< before finally going back up to 300 so before finally going back up to 300 so when< when it does this it takes a longer time when it does this it takes a longer time it< it actually means i make more from the it actually means i make more from the 20 20 20 because< because i would make the full intrinsic because i would make the full intrinsic value< value of the 10 value of the 10 and< and the extrinsic value would have and the extrinsic value would have decayed< decayed much more than it would if it decayed much more than it would if it had< had just gone up on you know the next had just gone up on you know the next day< day itself went up ten dollars right so day itself went up ten dollars right so because< because of this uh because of this. uh uh< uh thought which i have i decided to uh thought which i have i decided to take< take you know a 50 50 percent chance uh take you know a 50 50 percent chance uh sorry< sorry a 50 50 split in terms of sorry a 50 50 split in terms of extrinsic< extrinsic value and intrinsic value so extrinsic value and intrinsic value so the< the delta at the point of time from not the delta at the point of time from not wrong< wrong was around 60 deltas to 265 deltas wrong was around 60 deltas to 265 deltas that< that would give me a nice mix that would give me a nice mix of< of uh 10 of uh 10 extrinsic< extrinsic and ten dollars intrinsic so extrinsic and ten dollars intrinsic so that< that is why i decided to take the trade that is why i decided to take the trade so< so sure enough so sure enough the< the next few days you can see the market the next few days you can see the market shut< shut up so shut up so my< my goal has been pretty much my goal has been pretty much accomplished accomplished accomplished it< it has already went above the 300 strike it has already went above the 300 strike price< price which means to say i took the full price which means to say i took the full value< value of the 10 value of the 10 in< in terms of the intrinsic value in terms of the intrinsic value and< and then i took some of extrinsic value and then i took some of extrinsic value as< as well because this whole trade took uh as well because this whole trade took uh nine< nine days nine days right< right so the whole profit which i took right so the whole profit which i took was< was about a thousand over a thousand was about a thousand over a thousand hundred< hundred dollars plus hundred dollars plus okay< okay had i sold this 260 okay had i sold this 260 the< the chances are that my 500 the chances are that my 500 would< would only go to 250 dollars would only go to 250 dollars which< which is which is significantly lesser which is which is significantly lesser than< than this than this okay okay okay now< now what if i actually was wrong right i now what if i actually was wrong right i mentioned< mentioned this in the other video as mentioned this in the other video as well< well so um well so um if< if you want to sell in the money put the if you want to sell in the money put the thing< thing that you need to be comfortable thing that you need to be comfortable with< with is being assigned on the put with is being assigned on the put and< and that means that if i sold at the 300 and that means that if i sold at the 300 strike< strike price i had to feel comfortable strike price i had to feel comfortable buying< buying 100 shares at 300.

so for me i buying 100 shares at 300. so for me i was< was very comfortable doing it because was very comfortable doing it because firstly< firstly also this is the qqqs which is firstly also this is the qqqs which is the< the index the index right< right it means that in the long term right it means that in the long term the< the market is going to go back up the market is going to go back up regardless< regardless how long it's going to take regardless how long it's going to take the< the next you know half a year the next the next you know half a year the next year< year the next five years it will year the next five years it will eventually< eventually go up and i have the cash eventually go up and i have the cash right< right i have the crash to fulfill 100 right i have the crash to fulfill 100 shares< shares so for me it wasn't an issue for shares so for me it wasn't an issue for me< me to hold on to this in case i was me to hold on to this in case i was wrong< wrong as well so this is something that wrong as well so this is something that you< you want to take into consideration as you want to take into consideration as well well well okay< okay so as you can see the market in the okay so as you can see the market in the end< end just you know went back down end just you know went back down and< and this was a good decision to exit and this was a good decision to exit because< because it was overbought so if i because it was overbought so if i already< already have the in the money put option already have the in the money put option right< right it's at 300 and i see that it is right it's at 300 and i see that it is overbought< overbought it doesn't make sense for me overbought it doesn't make sense for me to< to hold it right because there's a to hold it right because there's a chance< chance that the market is going to go chance that the market is going to go back< back down if it goes back down why do i back down if it goes back down why do i want< want to give up the intrinsic value that want to give up the intrinsic value that i've< i've already made i've already made ten i've already made i've already made ten dollars< dollars in intrigue value right this dollars in intrigue value right this doesn't< doesn't decay with time it's just doesn't decay with time it's just basically< basically the difference between the basically the difference between the strike< strike price and the current market strike price and the current market price< price if i had a five dollars uh if i price if i had a five dollars uh if i sold< sold the five dollars 260 strike price sold the five dollars 260 strike price down< down here down here i< i could probably still say you know i i could probably still say you know i might< might want to hold right because time might want to hold right because time as< as it goes by it would decay as it goes by it would decay this< this money you see it would decay this this money you see it would decay this premium< premium so over time when you finally go premium so over time when you finally go back< back up back up i< i will make money on this as well so if i will make money on this as well so if i< i was holding it out the money put i was holding it out the money put option option option i< i could consider i could consider actually< actually still holding on to this boot actually still holding on to this boot to< to realize the full value if i wanted to to realize the full value if i wanted to or< or if i wanted to actually try and get or if i wanted to actually try and get you< you know fuel on this uh strike price i you know fuel on this uh strike price i wanted< wanted the market to go down to go to wanted the market to go down to go to 260< 260 i could do that 260 i could do that okay okay okay so so so here's< here's the time when you would want to here's the time when you would want to sell< sell an out of the money put all right sell an out of the money put all right the< the sell out the money put would be if the sell out the money put would be if the< the current price is still far from the current price is still far from where< where you want to go long so let's say where you want to go long so let's say for< for example right now it's at 289 and for example right now it's at 289 and then< then your ideal price that you might be then your ideal price that you might be saying< saying to yourself that you want to get saying to yourself that you want to get into< into this bucket will be 260 dollars into this bucket will be 260 dollars right< right so 260 dollars is still quite far right so 260 dollars is still quite far away< away so what i'll do is i will take a away so what i'll do is i will take a look< look at the option chain and i will see look at the option chain and i will see if< if it gives me a decent roi if it gives me a decent roi if< if it gives me a decent ri if it gives me a decent ri i'm< i'm definitely just going to sell the i'm definitely just going to sell the put< put right because i've already decided put right because i've already decided i'm< i'm going to get i'm going to get long< long at 260 if the market was to go down long at 260 if the market was to go down and< and get me a sign and get me a sign all< all right and finally you want to sell all right and finally you want to sell the< the other money put is when you want to the other money put is when you want to prioritize< prioritize income because prioritize income because out< out of the money put you can sell many out of the money put you can sell many more< more times than in the money put because more times than in the money put because in< in the money put you have to be a little in the money put you have to be a little bit< using< using technicals where you have to see using technicals where you have to see you< you know where the market is and then you know where the market is and then look< look at certain indicators to to have look at certain indicators to to have the< the hypothesis or the assumption that the hypothesis or the assumption that the< the market is going to go back up right the market is going to go back up right but< but if you're going to do the other but if you're going to do the other money< money it's going to be quite forgiving money it's going to be quite forgiving the< the market could just you know doing the market could just you know doing those< those sideways until here and it expires those sideways until here and it expires then< then you can sell again another put then you can sell again another put option< option at this point right you can sell option at this point right you can sell another< another 260 put option here and if it another 260 put option here and if it goes< goes you know sideways again go back up goes you know sideways again go back up them< them filled again then at this point of them filled again then at this point of time< time when it expire you can choose again time when it expire you can choose again to< to sell another put option right so this to sell another put option right so this is< is very much for income but you don't is very much for income but you don't want< want to do that for want to do that for um um um uh< uh for in the money put okay so in the uh for in the money put okay so in the money< money put it's much more if you have the money put it's much more if you have the technical< technical skills or technical analysis technical skills or technical analysis ability< ability to see you know if you feel the ability to see you know if you feel the. market< market is going to have a rebound back market is going to have a rebound back up up up so so so the< the time to sell in the money put is the time to sell in the money put is when< when you want to capture both intrinsic when you want to capture both intrinsic value< value and extrinsic value so again if value and extrinsic value so again if that< that based on what you see on the chart that based on what you see on the chart that< that the market is going to start to go that the market is going to start to go back< back up maybe you see a higher high back up maybe you see a higher high higher< higher low higher high higher lows higher low higher high higher lows then< then you might want to sell an in the then you might want to sell an in the money< money put above to try and capture the money put above to try and capture the intrinsic< intrinsic value because remember intrinsic value because remember intrinsic< intrinsic value can be captured intrinsic value can be captured immediately< immediately right so if on the day immediately right so if on the day itself< itself it moves up like say 10 points itself it moves up like say 10 points you< you could just close that out and you could just close that out and realize< realize quite a bit of that you can realize quite a bit of that you can realize< realize the full intrigue value and realize the full intrigue value and number< number two you don't mind getting number two you don't mind getting assigned< assigned at the strike price again same assigned at the strike price again same thing< thing you want to make sure that you thing you want to make sure that you have< have enough cash to get assigned if you have enough cash to get assigned if you don't< don't have the cash uh first of all you don't have the cash uh first of all you shouldn't< shouldn't be in the in the money put in shouldn't be in the in the money put in the< the first place but if you are more the first place but if you are more experienced< experienced then experienced then you< you need to know where to cut loss that you need to know where to cut loss that means< means you need to know based on the means you need to know based on the chart< chart on the graph let's say if you chart on the graph let's say if you would< would go back to the would go back to the the the the p< p l graph you could see that oh let's p l graph you could see that oh let's say< say uh i only want to lose a thousand say uh i only want to lose a thousand dollars< dollars maximum loss is a thousand dollars maximum loss is a thousand dollars< dollars on this trade then i'll be dollars on this trade then i'll be taking< taking a look at the point where i will taking a look at the point where i will lose< lose a thousand dollars which is at this lose a thousand dollars which is at this point< point down here right point down here right so< so it's telling me that if the market so it's telling me that if the market reaches< reaches around in between 65 to 17 maybe reaches around in between 65 to 17 maybe around< around 67 dollars if the market goes around 67 dollars if the market goes down< down to sixty seven dollars i am going down to sixty seven dollars i am going to< to cut my loss immediately right i'm not to cut my loss immediately right i'm not going< going to hold on to this trade and see going to hold on to this trade and see what< what happens so this is if you do not what happens so this is if you do not plan< plan to get assigned on the shares plan to get assigned on the shares okay< okay so okay so finally finally finally in< in the money puts most of the time or in the money puts most of the time or rather< rather all of the time i would suggest rather all of the time i would suggest that< that you would take a look at this that you would take a look at this indicator indicator indicator to< to see whether is it overbought or is it to see whether is it overbought or is it oversold< oversold right because the last thing oversold right because the last thing that< that you want is to sell in the money that you want is to sell in the money when< when the market is overbought right if when the market is overbought right if the< the market is overbought the market is overbought it< it means this tell you that there's a it means this tell you that there's a higher< higher chance higher probability that higher chance higher probability that the< the market is going to go down that it the market is going to go down that it is< is going to go up now of course this can is going to go up now of course this can you< you know you know it's< it's not always 100 accurate right it it's not always 100 accurate right it can< can the market can still keep going up can the market can still keep going up for< for sure for sure but< but there is you definitely still do not but there is you definitely still do not want< want to fight against the the movement want to fight against the the movement of< of the market of the market because because because right< right if you know the market has a right if you know the market has a higher< higher chance of it going down you don't higher chance of it going down you don't want< want to sell something of in the money want to sell something of in the money and< and then after that you get stuck with and then after that you get stuck with the< the position when the market goes down the position when the market goes down so< so you'll be smarter so you'll be smarter to< to wait till the market is oversold to wait till the market is oversold then< then you sell in the money uh put option then you sell in the money uh put option so< so maybe at this point when you see that so maybe at this point when you see that it< it is oversold you could sell the 280 it is oversold you could sell the 280 in< in the money put or maybe even the 290 in the money put or maybe even the 290 in< in the money put so this will give you a in the money put so this will give you a much much much higher< higher chance of success on your in the higher chance of success on your in the money< money put option so money put option so in< in general if you're still new to in general if you're still new to options< options trading all right and you options trading all right and you have< have just gotten started selling put have just gotten started selling put options< options i would suggest that you start options i would suggest that you start off< off with all the money put option first off with all the money put option first mainly< mainly because it is much more forgiving mainly because it is much more forgiving all< all right it's much more forgiving only all right it's much more forgiving only once< once you once you become< become more advanced and you're become more advanced and you're comfortable< comfortable with the fact that you can comfortable with the fact that you can get< get assigned on the shares and you want get assigned on the shares and you want to< to make intrinsic value on the move up to make intrinsic value on the move up as< as well as extrinsic value then you can as well as extrinsic value then you can start< start to consider exploring in the money start to consider exploring in the money put< put options all right guys that's it for put options all right guys that's it for this< this video i hope you liked it and if this video i hope you liked it and if you< you have kind please subscribe and you have kind please subscribe and

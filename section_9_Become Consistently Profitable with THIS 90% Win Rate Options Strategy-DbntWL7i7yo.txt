======================================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you a 90% I'm going to be sharing with you a 90% win< win rate option strategy that has been win rate option strategy that has been doing< doing pretty well for me and this is one doing pretty well for me and this is one of< of my bread and butter strategies that I of my bread and butter strategies that I use< use this pretty pretty often right so if use this pretty pretty often right so if you've< you've been watching some of my other you've been watching some of my other videos< videos you notice that I talk quite a videos you notice that I talk quite a bit< bit about credit spreads right but for bit about credit spreads right but for this< this strategy uh it's going to have a this strategy uh it's going to have a few< few more steps to construct compared to few more steps to construct compared to the< the credit spreads right for credit the credit spreads right for credit spreads< spreads is a two-legged strategy for spreads is a two-legged strategy for this< this stry I'm about to share with you this stry I'm about to share with you it's< it's going to have one additional leg so it's going to have one additional leg so it's< it's going to be slightly more complex it's going to be slightly more complex to< to construct but I'm going to show you to construct but I'm going to show you exactly< exactly how to construct it because once exactly how to construct it because once you< you get a hang of it and you put on a you get a hang of it and you put on a few< few of this trades then you're going to few of this trades then you're going to find< find that you know it's going to be find that you know it's going to be pretty< pretty simple and easy to construct pretty simple and easy to construct later< later on so what is this 90% win rate later on so what is this 90% win rate strategy< strategy so there are a few of them it strategy so there are a few of them it depends< depends on how you construct it but for depends on how you construct it but for this< this one that I'm talking about in this this one that I'm talking about in this video< video is none other than the broken wing video is none other than the broken wing butterfly< butterfly and for for this video I'm butterfly and for for this video I'm going< going to mainly focus on the put side going to mainly focus on the put side right< right so this will be the put broken right so this will be the put broken wing< wing butterfly and the main reason why I wing butterfly and the main reason why I mainly< mainly focus on the put programming mainly focus on the put programming butterfly< butterfly is because most of the butterfly is because most of the underlying< underlying that I tend to trade on have underlying that I tend to trade on have put< put skill right in fact most of the put skill right in fact most of the equities< equities that you put on they will have equities that you put on they will have put< put skill unless you manage to find put skill unless you manage to find certain< certain stocks that have call skill then certain stocks that have call skill then you< you want to put on the call broking you want to put on the call broking butterfly< butterfly right but for the most part butterfly right but for the most part especially< especially also with the index ETFs especially also with the index ETFs you're< you're going to have the put skill so you're going to have the put skill so you< you want to use to put broken wing you want to use to put broken wing butterfly< butterfly instead so what exactly is the butterfly instead so what exactly is the broken< broken wing butterfly now this is a broken wing butterfly now this is a slight< slight variation to the butterfly right slight variation to the butterfly right so< so if you have traded butterfly before so if you have traded butterfly before then< then you'll know that the p&amp;l graph will then you'll know that the p&amp;l graph will look< look something like this right so look something like this right so basically< basically your max profit zone is basically your max profit zone is somewhere< somewhere in the M middle so this is somewhere in the M middle so this is where< where you'll be making your profits if where you'll be making your profits if the< the market stays within this uh two the market stays within this uh two strikes< strikes down here this is where you'll strikes down here this is where you'll be< be placing your uh strikes and then you be placing your uh strikes and then you have< have one right at the middle this is have one right at the middle this is where< where you have have your max profit where you have have your max profit right< right so if you manage to pin you know right so if you manage to pin you know your< your short strike right at the middle your short strike right at the middle down< down here then you're going to make the down here then you're going to make the max< max profit but if the market you know max profit but if the market you know was< was to go much uh lower past this strike was to go much uh lower past this strike on< on your left hand side this is where on your left hand side this is where you're< you're going to start to lose money at you're going to start to lose money at the< the same time you know if the market the same time you know if the market goes< goes above your this range down here goes above your this range down here then< then this is where you're going to lose then this is where you're going to lose money< money as well so this is the p&amp;l graph money as well so this is the p&amp;l graph right< right so anything above here is a profit right so anything above here is a profit anything< anything below here will be in a loss anything below here will be in a loss right< right so as you can see down here if the right so as you can see down here if the market< market travels past this point down here market travels past this point down here you'll< you'll be having a loss at this point you'll be having a loss at this point here< here anything that goes past here you'll here anything that goes past here you'll be< be a loss here okay and if it stays be a loss here okay and if it stays somewhere< somewhere in the middle this is where somewhere in the middle this is where your< your max profit zone is right okay so your max profit zone is right okay so this< this is for the butterfly so you notice this is for the butterfly so you notice that< that the butterfly has rised to both that the butterfly has rised to both side< side for the butterfly you mainly want side for the butterfly you mainly want the< the underlying to just stay in the the underlying to just stay in the middle< middle right if it goes too far up or middle right if it goes too far up or too< too far down you'll lose money but for too far down you'll lose money but for the< the broken wing butterfly it's slightly the broken wing butterfly it's slightly different< different we're going to adjust it so different we're going to adjust it so that< that there is actually no risk to one that there is actually no risk to one side< side right so in fact there is no risk side right so in fact there is no risk to< to the upside right that means the risk to the upside right that means the risk is< is only on one side which is the is only on one side which is the downside< downside so if the stock or underlying downside so if the stock or underlying that< that you're trading just shoots all the that you're trading just shoots all the way< way to the Moon you actually don't have way to the Moon you actually don't have to< to worry right because you are still in to worry right because you are still in a< a profit so there only risk to one side a profit so there only risk to one side so< so how do you actually construct the so how do you actually construct the broken< broken wing butterfly so there are three broken wing butterfly so there are three legs< legs that you have to construct right so legs that you have to construct right so the< the very first leg is a long put right the very first leg is a long put right so< so this is going to be out of the money so this is going to be out of the money so< so as you can see on the chart on the so as you can see on the chart on the right< right hand side down here this is where right hand side down here this is where the< the current price is right so anything the current price is right so anything that< that is out of the money is below the that is out of the money is below the current< current market price so as you can see current market price so as you can see down< down here this is where the long put is down here this is where the long put is this< this is out of the money now the next L this is out of the money now the next L is< is where you're going to sell two is where you're going to sell two options< options right you're going to put two options right you're going to put two short< short puts on that's going to be further short puts on that's going to be further out< out of the money right this is where out of the money right this is where your< your max profit is going to be right and your max profit is going to be right and then< then after that you're going to put on then after that you're going to put on One< One Long put that is even further out of One Long put that is even further out of the< the money and this is where you define the money and this is where you define your< your risk right this is where you kept your risk right this is where you kept your< your risk which means to say that you your risk which means to say that you know< know the market if it goes all the way know the market if it goes all the way past< past this level down here let's say at past this level down here let's say at this< this point around 165 you only can lose this point around 165 you only can lose up< up to that point right that means if the up to that point right that means if the stock< stock goes to zero guess what your loss stock goes to zero guess what your loss has< has already been limited you already has already been limited you already know< know your loss upfront right so this is know your loss upfront right so this is actually< actually pretty good for beginners if actually pretty good for beginners if you're< you're just starting out because your you're just starting out because your loss< loss has been kept right because if you loss has been kept right because if you remove< remove this by the way if you remove remove this by the way if you remove this< this uh put option down here now this this uh put option down here now this structure< structure here becomes a put ratio structure here becomes a put ratio spread< spread so a put ratio spread is an spread so a put ratio spread is an undefined< undefined risk strategy whereby you know undefined risk strategy whereby you know it< it can be pretty profitable but it can be pretty profitable but depending< depending on how you construct it right depending on how you construct it right because< because also one thing is you need to because also one thing is you need to choose< choose the right underlying now if the choose the right underlying now if the underlying< underlying just keeps going all the way underlying just keeps going all the way down< down to zero then this construct down down to zero then this construct down here< here which is the put Rao spread it's here which is the put Rao spread it's going< going to keep losing money as the market going to keep losing money as the market goes< goes down but if you have this put goes down but if you have this put broken< broken wing butterfly down here the broken wing butterfly down here the market< market can go all the way down for all market can go all the way down for all your< your care you already got your max risk your care you already got your max risk cap< cap you're not going to lose more than cap you're not going to lose more than that< that right so that is why this long put that right so that is why this long put down< down here is pretty important for you to down here is pretty important for you to Define< Define your risk all right so this is Define your risk all right so this is how< how you actually construct the put how you actually construct the put broken< broken wing butterfly slightly more broken wing butterfly slightly more steps< steps than the normal credit spreads steps than the normal credit spreads that< that most people are used to there are that most people are used to there are three< three legs all right so how does it look three legs all right so how does it look like< like on the p&amp;l graph right so this is like on the p&amp;l graph right so this is the< the p&amp;l graph so the first thing you not the p&amp;l graph so the first thing you not is< is that it has a very high win rate is that it has a very high win rate right< right again it depends on how you right again it depends on how you construct< construct and I'm going to show you construct and I'm going to show you later< later on exactly how to construct this later on exactly how to construct this so< so you can achieve you know 90% odd kind so you can achieve you know 90% odd kind of< of a win rate all right so the first of a win rate all right so the first thing< thing is that it has a pretty high win thing is that it has a pretty high win rate< rate now next how do you construct this rate now next how do you construct this on< on a p&amp;l graph you can see it's the same on a p&amp;l graph you can see it's the same right< right so this is where the current right so this is where the current market< market price is you want your long put market price is you want your long put the< the first one that is going to be out of the first one that is going to be out of the< the money then two short puts going to the money then two short puts going to be< be slightly further out of money and be slightly further out of money and then< then you have one long put that is much then you have one long put that is much further< further out of the money to Define where further out of the money to Define where your< your max loss is so if you can see on your max loss is so if you can see on this< this uh graph down here where you're this uh graph down here where you're going< going. to profit is anywhere past this going to profit is anywhere past this point< point down here right this is where your point down here right this is where your break< break even point is Right anything above break even point is Right anything above this< this break even Point you're going to be this break even Point you're going to be in< in a profit so that is the reason why in a profit so that is the reason why you< you know this has a very high win rate you know this has a very high win rate well< well because you know the market well because you know the market basically< basically can go up you're going to be basically can go up you're going to be profit< profit the market can also go down and profit the market can also go down and it< it still can profit as well right as it still can profit as well right as long< long as it does not go past this point long as it does not go past this point this< this break even Point down here you're this break even Point down here you're going< going to be still in a profit right so going to be still in a profit right so if< if you notice down here there are if you notice down here there are actually< actually two types of profit zone right actually two types of profit zone right the< the first profit zone is down here right the first profit zone is down here right so< so this is where you get your minimum so this is where you get your minimum profit< profit right minimum profit is basically profit right minimum profit is basically the< the credit which you receive for selling the credit which you receive for selling on< on this uh put broking butterfly so this on this uh put broking butterfly so this put< put broken wing butterfly is a credit put broken wing butterfly is a credit kind< kind of strategy that means you're kind of strategy that means you're selling< selling premium you receive a premium um selling premium you receive a premium um for< for putting on this strategy and this is for putting on this strategy and this is where< where you get your minimum profits past where you get your minimum profits past this< this long put uh Point down here right this long put uh Point down here right so< so if the market keeps going all the way so if the market keeps going all the way to< to the moon at least you still get to the moon at least you still get something< something right now the next profit zone something right now the next profit zone is< is where I call the tent right I call is where I call the tent right I call this< this the tent so this is where you have this the tent so this is where you have the< the opportunity to actually you know get the opportunity to actually you know get this< this uh Max profit down here now of this uh Max profit down here now of course< course most of the time you won't get it course most of the time you won't get it but< but there will be certain times where but there will be certain times where you< you could hit it or very close to it you could hit it or very close to it right< right this is where you can get the next right this is where you can get the next uh< uh profit if you will right so one thing uh profit if you will right so one thing good< good about this strategy if you notice good about this strategy if you notice is< is that you have an incentive for the is that you have an incentive for the market< market to go down in your mind right market to go down in your mind right most< most of the time when people put on any most of the time when people put on any strategy< strategy when they get into the stock strategy when they get into the stock market< market a lot of people are afraid that market a lot of people are afraid that the< the market goes down right because the market goes down right because generally< generally most people have the mindset generally most people have the mindset that< that if you get into the stock market that if you get into the stock market the< the thing that helps you make money is the thing that helps you make money is if< if the stock goes up right but in this if the stock goes up right but in this case< case you do not really have to worry if case you do not really have to worry if the< the market goes down to to a certain the market goes down to to a certain extent< extent right because first thing if the extent right because first thing if the market< market goes up hey you still make money market goes up hey you still make money right< right so again this is where the current right so again this is where the current market< market price is if the market goes up market price is if the market goes up hey< hey you at least make some money right hey you at least make some money right you< you get the premium which you sold this you get the premium which you sold this whole< whole uh option strategy for now if the whole uh option strategy for now if the market< market goes down guess what you then market goes down guess what you then have< have the opportunity to get you know the have the opportunity to get you know the price< price into this uh tense down here where price into this uh tense down here where you< you have the opportunity to have the max you have the opportunity to have the max profit< profit right you can see that you know profit right you can see that you know there's< there's an opportunity for you to make there's an opportunity for you to make much< much more than the minimum credit for much more than the minimum credit for this< this trade so that is why you know you this trade so that is why you know you don't< don't really have to worry in fact don't really have to worry in fact whenever< whenever I put on this strategy a lot of whenever I put on this strategy a lot of time< time I find myself wanting the market to time I find myself wanting the market to go< go down because this is where you can go down because this is where you can actually< actually have a chance to get this Max actually have a chance to get this Max profit< profit now of course you do not want it profit now of course you do not want it to< to go so far down that you know this is to go so far down that you know this is where< where you get into your loss zone so where you get into your loss zone so this< this is the second part now the second this is the second part now the second part< part is where your loss zone is so as part is where your loss zone is so as you< you can see you do not immediately lose you can see you do not immediately lose the< the max profit as you can see your the max profit as you can see your losses< losses you know starts to gradually get losses you know starts to gradually get gets< gets bigger only as the market goes down gets bigger only as the market goes down right< right but then you have your max loss right but then you have your max loss already< already kept at this point down here so already kept at this point down here so even< even though if the market goes all the even though if the market goes all the way< way down let's say for example from this way down let's say for example from this uh< uh current market price it travels all uh current market price it travels all the< the way down then you don't have to be the way down then you don't have to be afraid< afraid right because you already know afraid right because you already know what's< what's this Max loss going to be all what's this Max loss going to be all right< right so this is how it looks like on right so this is how it looks like on the< the p&amp;l graph now I want to give you the p&amp;l graph now I want to give you also< also a visual on the chart because some also a visual on the chart because some people< people like to see the chart rather than people like to see the chart rather than the< the p&amp;l graph so as you can see down the p&amp;l graph so as you can see down here< here once you construct your put broker here once you construct your put broker wing< wing butterfly your profit Zone down wing butterfly your profit Zone down here< here is pretty big right again down here here is pretty big right again down here if< if you see this uh minus two put this is if you see this uh minus two put this is where< where your max profit zone is so if you where your max profit zone is so if you can< can just Envision this graph down here can just Envision this graph down here let< let me just bring up to the graph again let me just bring up to the graph again so< so let me just remove this drawing you so let me just remove this drawing you can< can see the graph down here looks like can see the graph down here looks like this< this right there's this uh nice tent and this right there's this uh nice tent and then< then it goes up and then your uh p&amp;l then it goes up and then your uh p&amp;l Zone< Zone the point where you go to zero is Zone the point where you go to zero is below< below this line down here so if we were below this line down here so if we were to< to go to this uh chart down here here to go to this uh chart down here here you< you notice how it looks like is actually you notice how it looks like is actually like< like this right this is where you have like this right this is where you have your< your minimum profit then it starts to go your minimum profit then it starts to go up< up right this is where it starts to go up right this is where it starts to go up< up then after that this is where it up then after that this is where it starts< starts to go down and then this is where starts to go down and then this is where you< you have your max loss right so you can you have your max loss right so you can see< see down here this is roughly where your see down here this is roughly where your break< break even point is this is where your break even point is this is where your max< max profit zone is so you can see if the max profit zone is so you can see if the market< market goes up down here you're going to market goes up down here you're going to be< be a profit but it's just going to be be a profit but it's just going to be the< the minimum profit it's only when the the minimum profit it's only when the market< market goes past this uh long put strike market goes past this uh long put strike down< down here that's where you have a chance down here that's where you have a chance to< to get you know slightly more profits to get you know slightly more profits depending< depending on where it lands right so depending on where it lands right so this< this is where your tent is from here to this is where your tent is from here to here< here that anything past that this is here that anything past that this is where< where your loss zone is going to be and where your loss zone is going to be and I< I put the red color all the way up to I put the red color all the way up to here< here right is mainly because your loss here right is mainly because your loss is< is kept up to this point right so if it is kept up to this point right so if it goes< goes all the way past here it's going to goes all the way past here it's going to be< be a loss as well but it's just that you be a loss as well but it's just that you know< know your loss has already been kept know your loss has already been kept your< your losses do not keep increasing as it your losses do not keep increasing as it goes< goes down now for some people this may goes down now for some people this may seem< seem a little bit confusing right right seem a little bit confusing right right basically< basically you know you have the one long basically you know you have the one long put< put you have two short puts you have one put you have two short puts you have one long< long put so the way that I like to you long put so the way that I like to you know< know put it to people how to construct know put it to people how to construct the< the broken wing butterfly especially the broken wing butterfly especially those< those who are you know very familiar those who are you know very familiar with< with trading credit spreads is that it's with trading credit spreads is that it's actually< actually just a combination of a credit actually just a combination of a credit spread< spread and a debit spread right let me spread and a debit spread right let me explain< explain to you what it means right so explain to you what it means right so instead< instead of seeing it as you know three instead of seeing it as you know three legs< legs just see it as this right first off legs just see it as this right first off you< you have the put credit spread right so you have the put credit spread right so the< the put credit spread is the one right the put credit spread is the one right at< at the bottom right so for those of you at the bottom right so for those of you who< who have been trading you know credit who have been trading you know credit spreads< spreads this is your bull put spread so spreads this is your bull put spread so you'll< you'll be basically putting on a put you'll be basically putting on a put credit< credit spread where you receive a credit credit spread where you receive a credit now< now with that credit what you're going now with that credit what you're going to< to do is you're going to purchase a to do is you're going to purchase a debit< debit spread so as you can see the debit debit spread so as you can see the debit spread< spread is on the right hand side the spread is on the right hand side the credit< credit spread is on the left hand side credit spread is on the left hand side so< so for the credit spread you'll be so for the credit spread you'll be receiving< receiving a credit so let's say for receiving a credit so let's say for example< example you receive roughly around let's example you receive roughly around let's say< say $2 right you receive $2 in terms of say $2 right you receive $2 in terms of credit< credit spread now with this $2 what credit spread now with this $2 what you're< you're going to do is you're going to you're going to do is you're going to purchase< purchase this debit spread down here now purchase this debit spread down here now this< this put debit spread let's say you can this put debit spread let's say you can buy< buy one for buy one for $1. 50< $1.

50 so you receive $2 in terms of $1. 50 so you receive $2 in terms of credit< credit you purchase. this put debit credit you purchase this put debit spread< spread for $1.

50 what is your left over spread for $1. 50 what is your left over your< your leftover will be a positive 50 your leftover will be a positive 50 cents< cents right so now you have a positive cents right so now you have a positive 50< 50 cents this is how you get a minimum 50 cents this is how you get a minimum credit< credit if the market just goes up right credit if the market just goes up right so< so this is how I would suggest that you so this is how I would suggest that you actually< actually look at the broken wing actually look at the broken wing butterfly< butterfly because it's pretty simple butterfly because it's pretty simple right< right use a put credit spread to finance right use a put credit spread to finance a< a put debit spread so if you were to a put debit spread so if you were to combine< combine these two together this is how combine these two together this is how you< you get the broken wing butterfly now you get the broken wing butterfly now for< for those of you who have a bigger for those of you who have a bigger account< account right maybe you have six figures account right maybe you have six figures in< in account then maybe you might want to in account then maybe you might want to consider< consider putting on the undefined risk consider putting on the undefined risk version< version which is the put ratio spread so version which is the put ratio spread so this< this is the one that I talked about this is the one that I talked about earlier< earlier right so there'll be you know earlier right so there'll be you know some< some people who have pretty big accounts some people who have pretty big accounts and< and you notice that you know if you put and you notice that you know if you put on< on the put brokering butterfly you know on the put brokering butterfly you know it's< it's it's not going to give you the kind it's it's not going to give you the kind of< of desired kind of uh uh structure that of desired kind of uh uh structure that you< you want right mainly because the put you want right mainly because the put ratio< ratio spread because you do not have ratio spread because you do not have this< this one extra long put down here right this one extra long put down here right we< we don't have this what's going to we don't have this what's going to happen< happen is that you're going to have more happen is that you're going to have more credit< credit from this two put options that's credit from this two put options that's going< going to help you craft a bigger T So going to help you craft a bigger T So generally< generally with the put ratio spread you generally with the put ratio spread you can< can have a higher win rate as well right can have a higher win rate as well right but< but for those of you you know if you but for those of you you know if you don't< don't have that big of a capital you don't have that big of a capital you have< have a smaller Capital then definitely have a smaller Capital then definitely go< go for the put broken wing butterfly so go for the put broken wing butterfly so this< this is just an option for those people this is just an option for those people you< you know also maybe because you might you know also maybe because you might want< want to use this if you're using on some want to use this if you're using on some underlying< underlying that's very very cheap right underlying that's very very cheap right if< if you have you have some underlying if you have you have some underlying that< that you trade on that is very very that you trade on that is very very small< small let's say maybe like $10 $20 then small let's say maybe like $10 $20 then maybe< maybe you could consider using the put maybe you could consider using the put ratio< ratio spread there because it might make ratio spread there because it might make more< more sense to construct it there all more sense to construct it there all right< right so as you can see this is the p&amp;l right so as you can see this is the p&amp;l graph< graph for the put ratio spread you can graph for the put ratio spread you can see< see it's pretty much the same as the put see it's pretty much the same as the put broken< broken wi butterfly right it's just the broken wi butterfly right it's just the difference< difference between each other is just difference between each other is just this< this long put so in this case you notice this long put so in this case you notice you're< you're missing this uh long put down you're missing this uh long put down here< here to define the risk next and more here to define the risk next and more importantly< importantly why do you want to trade the importantly why do you want to trade the broken< broken wing butterfly so I'm going to broken wing butterfly so I'm going to give< give you a few very good reasons why you give you a few very good reasons why you want< want to trade this broken wing butterfly want to trade this broken wing butterfly now< now the very first reason is that it has now the very first reason is that it has a< a very high win rate right as you can a very high win rate right as you can see< see this is a 90% win rate and in my see this is a 90% win rate and in my experience< experience I've actually been getting experience I've actually been getting you< you know slightly higher than 90% so if you know slightly higher than 90% so if you< you are the kind of person that like to you are the kind of person that like to win< win often right then you might want to win often right then you might want to consider< consider this strategy as well now next consider this strategy as well now next this< this is an omnidirectional option this is an omnidirectional option strategy< strategy that means it can profit in strategy that means it can profit in many< many directions right you have already many directions right you have already seen< seen in the p&amp;l graph so I'm just going seen in the p&amp;l graph so I'm just going to< to demonstrate to you here again right to demonstrate to you here again right this< this is where the current price is you this is where the current price is you notice< notice that if the market goes up you're notice that if the market goes up you're still< still going to be profitable if the still going to be profitable if the market< market stays down here doesn't really market stays down here doesn't really move< move then you're still going to be in move then you're still going to be in profit< profit now if the market goes down as profit now if the market goes down as well< well as long as it doesn't go past you well as long as it doesn't go past you know< know where the break even point is let's know where the break even point is let's say< say somewhere down here then from here say somewhere down here then from here to< to here you're still going to make to here you're still going to make profit< profit in fact you're going to make much profit in fact you're going to make much more< more than if the market goes up right so. more than if the market goes up right so you< you can see the market can go up it can you can see the market can go up it can go< go sideways it can go down to a certain go sideways it can go down to a certain extent< extent and you still can be profitable extent and you still can be profitable so< so that is why you know I really like so that is why you know I really like this< this strategy a lot next it can be a this strategy a lot next it can be a good< good semi hedge to a long portfolio so good semi hedge to a long portfolio so maybe< maybe you have you know a portfolio maybe you have you know a portfolio whereby< whereby you have many long strategies whereby you have many long strategies right< right be it like uh debit spreads that right be it like uh debit spreads that is< is uh bullish or maybe you have uh leaps is uh bullish or maybe you have uh leaps that< that is bullish as well or maybe you put that is bullish as well or maybe you put on< on the bull put spread there's bullish on the bull put spread there's bullish as< as well or you have just long stock as well or you have just long stock positions< positions right in any case in all those positions right in any case in all those bullish< bullish strategies having this can be a bullish strategies having this can be a pretty< pretty good semi hatch because if the pretty good semi hatch because if the market< market goes up first of all you will market goes up first of all you will make< make money on all the other bullish make money on all the other bullish strategies< strategies but if the market goes down strategies but if the market goes down you< you will lose on them but in this case you will lose on them but in this case you< you actually have a chance to you know you actually have a chance to you know try< try and pin this short strike down here try and pin this short strike down here to< to get you know much more profit uh than to get you know much more profit uh than this< this uh minimum profit if the market this uh minimum profit if the market goes< goes up right so in a sense I call this goes up right so in a sense I call this a< a semi hedge as well because it's not a semi hedge as well because it's not going< going to fully of course cover the going to fully of course cover the losses< losses of your you know other positions losses of your you know other positions but< but it's better than nothing right at but it's better than nothing right at least< least you're going to get something to least you're going to get something to kind< kind of hatch your long portfolio as the kind of hatch your long portfolio as the market< market starts to go down next and I market starts to go down next and I think< think this is a very important point think this is a very important point that< that many people kind of Miss is that it that many people kind of Miss is that it is< is very psychologically easy to put on is very psychologically easy to put on because< because you can potentially make more because you can potentially make more when< when the market declines right like I when the market declines right like I mentioned< mentioned earlier on many people are mentioned earlier on many people are afraid< afraid that the market goes down right afraid that the market goes down right because< because when the market goes down because when the market goes down generally< generally people think that they're generally people think that they're going< going to lose money but in this case you going to lose money but in this case you actually< actually want the market to go down actually want the market to go down right< right you want it to get into this 10 right you want it to get into this 10 down< down here this is where your max profit down here this is where your max profit zone< zone is and if it does you can actually zone is and if it does you can actually make< make a pretty good profit now next it make a pretty good profit now next it can< can also have a good risk to reward can also have a good risk to reward ratio< ratio for a premium selling strategy now ratio for a premium selling strategy now as< as you know if you have been trading you as you know if you have been trading you know< know these types of Premium selling know these types of Premium selling strategy< strategy like the credit spreads or even strategy like the credit spreads or even the< the iron Condor you'll notice that the the iron Condor you'll notice that the risk< risk to reot ratio is generally not that risk to reot ratio is generally not that fav< fav aable right most of the time for fav aable right most of the time for this< this kind of strategies you'll be this kind of strategies you'll be risking< risking let's say uh three just to make risking let's say uh three just to make one< one or maybe risk four to make one right one or maybe risk four to make one right that's< that's the kind of typical risk reward that's the kind of typical risk reward ratio< ratio you get in terms of Premium ratio you get in terms of Premium selling< selling strategy but when it comes to selling strategy but when it comes to this< this broken wing butterfly you can this broken wing butterfly you can actually< actually construct one that is one is to actually construct one that is one is to one< one or even close to it right and I'm one or even close to it right and I'm going< going to show you how to do that later going to show you how to do that later on< on and it all really depends on how you on and it all really depends on how you construct< construct you know this booking construct you know this booking butterfly< butterfly so basically the risk reward butterfly so basically the risk reward can< can be pretty good now when I talk about can be pretty good now when I talk about risk< risk to reward here by the way I'm risk to reward here by the way I'm talking< talking about the max profit to the max talking about the max profit to the max loss< loss and finally it's consistently loss and finally it's consistently profitable<

com / blueprint all right with davis. com / blueprint all right back< back to the video right the market can back to the video right the market can be< be bullish can be sideways can be even be bullish can be sideways can be even bearish< bearish as well and especially you know bearish as well and especially you know in< in a 2022 the market was pretty bearish in a 2022 the market was pretty bearish right< right the market went down and this right the market went down and this strategy< strategy actually did pretty well for me strategy actually did pretty well for me right< right so I just pull up the last 50 right so I just pull up the last 50 trades< trades or so right in this case 51 trades or so right in this case 51 trades< trades the last sample size of 51 trades trades the last sample size of 51 trades and< and you notice that there are quite a and you notice that there are quite a number< number of winners right out of 51 trades number of winners right out of 51 trades you< you notice there are 49 winners and only you notice there are 49 winners and only two< two losers right you have a loss down two losers right you have a loss down here< here and then a loss down here as well here and then a loss down here as well and< and overall you can see it's winner and overall you can see it's winner right< right if you talk about the win rate you right if you talk about the win rate you can< can see it's 96% although you know it can see it's 96% although you know it should< should be roughly around 90% right so as should be roughly around 90% right so as you< you can see it is a very very high win you can see it is a very very high win rate< rate strategy and you get to win a lot rate strategy and you get to win a lot of< of the time but although one thing you of the time but although one thing you have< have to understand is that most of the have to understand is that most of the time< time you tend to win just the minimum time you tend to win just the minimum credit< credit uh because you know if the market credit uh because you know if the market goes< goes up and also depending on when you goes up and also depending on when you put< put on this strategy if the market go put on this strategy if the market go goes< goes up it never comes down to 10 then goes up it never comes down to 10 then you're< you're just going to make the minimum you're just going to make the minimum right< right which is also fine as well because right which is also fine as well because it's< it's definitely better then you lose it's definitely better then you lose money< money all right so the next thing I want money all right so the next thing I want you< you to see down here is the Delta so you you to see down here is the Delta so you notice< notice down here I have a varying Delta notice down here I have a varying Delta right< right you have 19 Delta your 16 Delta right you have 19 Delta your 16 Delta and< and this is how you actually construct and this is how you actually construct right< right how you actually get to 90% win right how you actually get to 90% win rate< rate it really comes down to the Delta rate it really comes down to the Delta so< so I'm going to show you in the trading so I'm going to show you in the trading platform< platform how to construct your broken platform how to construct your broken wing< wing butterfly so that you can get wing butterfly so that you can get around< around 90% win rate okay so we are in around 90% win rate okay so we are in the< the think of Swing platform for the web the think of Swing platform for the web version< version all right so the first thing you version all right so the first thing you want< want to do is to open up your option want to do is to open up your option chain< chain right so for the option chain you chain right so for the option chain you can< can see down here what we're going to can see down here what we're going to focus< focus on is on the put side right so the focus on is on the put side right so the put< put side is on the right hand side so put side is on the right hand side so for< for you to construct a put broken wing for you to construct a put broken wing butterfly< butterfly that is 90% and above what is butterfly that is 90% and above what is very< very important is where the short strike very important is where the short strike Delta< Delta is right so remember we have the Delta is right so remember we have the two< two short strikes that Define where your two short strikes that Define where your max< max profit zone is so this is where we max profit zone is so this is where we want< want to decide what that Delta is so want to decide what that Delta is so generally< generally for you to go somewhere around generally for you to go somewhere around 90%< 90% or close to 90% you want that short 90% or close to 90% you want that short strike< strike Delta to be around 16 to 20 strike Delta to be around 16 to 20 Deltas< Deltas right so if you were to take a Deltas right so if you were to take a look< look at the uh uh this down here on this look at the uh uh this down here on this right< right hand side this column it says right hand side this column it says Delta< Delta over here this is where we are Delta over here this is where we are going< going to choose our short strike first going to choose our short strike first right< right so we always start off by right so we always start off by selecting< selecting the short strikes for our put selecting the short strikes for our put broking< broking butterfly so in this case we broking butterfly so in this case we want< want to go somewhere for. 16 to 20 Delta want to go somewhere for 16 to 20 Delta so< so as you can see we got quite a number so as you can see we got quite a number of< of choices right so for this let's just of choices right so for this let's just go< go with let's say the 18 Delta right go with let's say the 18 Delta right let's< let's just choose one somewhere in the let's just choose one somewhere in the middle< middle so I'll go with this so what I'll middle so I'll go with this so what I'll do< do is that I first click on this to get do is that I first click on this to get my< my shorts strike and what I'll do is I my shorts strike and what I'll do is I will< will adjust this to two right so for the will adjust this to two right so for the uh< uh think of swim web web version it's uh think of swim web web version it's going< going to be a little bit more manual going to be a little bit more manual right< right if you have the uh desktop version right if you have the uh desktop version then< then you can just right click and then then you can just right click and then just< just you know put on the uh butterfly just you know put on the uh butterfly and< and just adjust your strikes from there and just adjust your strikes from there right< right but for this example because I'm right but for this example because I'm using< using the web version uh you have to be using the web version uh you have to be a< a little bit more manual for this right a little bit more manual for this right so< so I'm going to change this to two now so I'm going to change this to two now the< the next thing that you want to select the next thing that you want to select will< will be the long put strike that will be the long put strike that actually< actually uh protects this whole actually uh protects this whole structure< structure right basically where you're structure right basically where you're defining< defining your risk and if you think defining your risk and if you think about< about it it's actually the long put for about it it's actually the long put for the< the put credit spread side so remember I the put credit spread side so remember I talked< talked about thinking of this uh broking talked about thinking of this uh broking butterfly< butterfly as having a put credit spread butterfly as having a put credit spread that< that finances a put debit spread so now that finances a put debit spread so now we're< we're trying to uh figure out what is we're trying to uh figure out what is the< the long putut for the put credit spread the long putut for the put credit spread side< side right so for this you want to go side right so for this you want to go all< all the way all the way up< up uh let me just bring up my mouse down up uh let me just bring up my mouse down here< here yep so you want to find one uh long here yep so you want to find one uh long put< put somewhere around here that is put somewhere around here that is further< further away from where your short further away from where your short strike< strike is now how do you define what the strike is now how do you define what the long< long putut is now this all comes down to long putut is now this all comes down to what< what your max risk on the trade is right what your max risk on the trade is right so< so if your max risk is $500 then the so if your max risk is $500 then the first< first thing you want to do is start off first thing you want to do is start off where< where your long putut is somewhere where your long putut is somewhere around< around 5 to 10 points away from where around 5 to 10 points away from where this< this current short putut is so for this this current short putut is so for this case< case let me just jump 10 points away case let me just jump 10 points away right< right so 458 I'll just go to 448 and right so 458 I'll just go to 448 and then< then I'm going to start constructing then I'm going to start constructing from< from there now this is not going to be from there now this is not going to be the< the final structure because it all the final structure because it all really< really depends on where you can buy the really depends on where you can buy the other< other long put which is the put debit other long put which is the put debit spread< spread all right so I'm just going to spread all right so I'm just going to put< put it down here first so the next thing put it down here first so the next thing I'm< I'm going to do is I'm going to adjust I'm going to do is I'm going to adjust this< this part down here to one contract now this part down here to one contract now I'm< I'm going to find the long put so this I'm going to find the long put so this is< is going to be the long putut for your is going to be the long putut for your debit< debit spread so this is where you want debit spread so this is where you want to< to you know play around with it a little to you know play around with it a little bit< bit right so there's a little bit of uh bit right so there's a little bit of uh just< just changing the strikes back and forth just changing the strikes back and forth to< to find the desired structure that you to find the desired structure that you want< want that is why I say at the start you want that is why I say at the start you know< know it's going to be a little bit more know it's going to be a little bit more complex< complex slightly more more steps than complex slightly more more steps than putting< putting on just a credit spread so for putting on just a credit spread so for this< this let's just go for 5.

wi first and this let's just go for 5. wi first and see< see what we get right so 5.

uh white or see what we get right so 5. uh white or rather< rather away from 458 is rather away from 458 is 463< 463 right so down here you notice you 463 right so down here you notice you have< have your put broker wing butterfly have your put broker wing butterfly structure< structure ready now the first thing you structure ready now the first thing you notice< notice is that you have 19 cents in notice is that you have 19 cents in terms< terms of credit right 19 cents is the terms of credit right 19 cents is the mid< mid price so what you want to do is you mid price so what you want to do is you want< want to see what is the max uh loss for want to see what is the max uh loss for this< this so for this you can see we want to this so for this you can see we want to take< take a look at the buying power effect take a look at the buying power effect now< now the buying power effect is around now the buying power effect is around $500< $500 which is exactly what we want right $500 which is exactly what we want right because< because our Max B we have decided for because our Max B we have decided for the< the trade is going to be 500 so the the trade is going to be 500 so the buying< buying power effect for a defined risk buying power effect for a defined risk strategy< strategy is basically the same as your strategy is basically the same as your max< max loss right but if you have an max loss right but if you have an undefined< undefined risk strategy it's going to be undefined risk strategy it's going to be different< different right so I'm not going to be different right so I'm not going to be touching< touching on undefined RIS strategy for touching on undefined RIS strategy for this< this uh video let's talk about just the this uh video let's talk about just the put< put broker wing butterfly so so put broker wing butterfly so so basically< basically your buying power effect is basically your buying power effect is the< the same as your max loss so if you see the same as your max loss so if you see that< that 483 is your buying power effect it that 483 is your buying power effect it just< just means your max loss is 483 so this just means your max loss is 483 so this is< is pretty good now the next thing you is pretty good now the next thing you want< want to take a look at is the credit so want to take a look at is the credit so for< for this you have about $16 in terms of for this you have about $16 in terms of credit< credit which is actually okay right not credit which is actually okay right not so< so bad so right now you have a decision so bad so right now you have a decision to< to make right do you want more credit to make right do you want more credit and< and then have a slightly smaller tent or and then have a slightly smaller tent or do< do you want lesser credit and have a big do you want lesser credit and have a big tent< tent right as you can see this is going tent right as you can see this is going to< to be a little bit of a tradeoff right to be a little bit of a tradeoff right it's< it's not something where you know you it's not something where you know you can< can find the best structure for this it can find the best structure for this it already< already really depends on what you want already really depends on what you want so< so if you are someone who likes it to be so if you are someone who likes it to be you< you know a bigger tent where you know you know a bigger tent where you know you're< you're afraid that the market drops down you're afraid that the market drops down or< or you're using as a hedge for any long or you're using as a hedge for any long stocks< stocks that you have in your portfolio stocks that you have. in your portfolio then< then you might want to go for a bigger then you might want to go for a bigger tent< tent so in this case if I want to go for tent so in this case if I want to go for a< a bigger tent what I'll do is I'll a bigger tent what I'll do is I'll adjust< adjust my debit strke down here so I may adjust my debit strke down here so I may want< want to go for one strike away and see want to go for one strike away and see what< what I can get so if you notice down what I can get so if you notice down here< here I can actually get 40 cents credit here I can actually get 40 cents credit even< even after commissions which is actually even after commissions which is actually pretty< pretty good right but what it also means pretty good right but what it also means is< is that if the market just shoots up is that if the market just shoots up from< from where I put on this uh structure from where I put on this uh structure where< where I put on this put brokering where I put on this put brokering butterfly< butterfly I'm just only going to get 40 butterfly I'm just only going to get 40 cents< cents right which is going to be a cents right which is going to be a little< little bit you know too little for me little bit you know too little for me right< right so in this case I may want to right so in this case I may want to adjust< adjust so the next thing you can adjust adjust so the next thing you can adjust is< is you notice your buying power now has is you notice your buying power now has gone< gone down right previously if you notice gone down right previously if you notice it< it was around $480 but now he has it was around $480 but now he has dropped< dropped to $399 now why is this so why dropped to $399 now why is this so why is< is it that when we adjust this strike is it that when we adjust this strike down< down here just one strike away we have a down here just one strike away we have a slightly< slightly lower buying power effect which slightly lower buying power effect which means< means to say our Max loss is lower the means to say our Max loss is lower the reason< reason is because the max profit of your reason is because the max profit of your tent< tent has now increased because you have tent has now increased because you have now< now increased the debit spread right now increased the debit spread right your< your debit spread width is now wider your debit spread width is now wider it's< it's now six points wide which means to it's now six points wide which means to say< say your max profit is higher which say your max profit is higher which takes< takes away from the max loss which you takes away from the max loss which you initially< initially had right so in this case down initially had right so in this case down here< here since we have 399 as our Max loss I here since we have 399 as our Max loss I want< want to adjust this a little bit right want to adjust this a little bit right because< because I still have room to add more because I still have room to add more risk< risk to this remember it's about $500 my risk to this remember it's about $500 my risk< risk so what I'm going to do is I'm risk so what I'm going to do is I'm going< going to stretch this by one more strike going to stretch this by one more strike as< as well so if I stretch this by one more as well so if I stretch this by one more strike< strike now you notice I have $488 in strike now you notice I have $488 in terms< terms of my buying power effect which my terms of my buying power effect which my Max< Max loss and my credit now jumps up to Max loss and my credit now jumps up to $6.

40< $6. 40 so which is not so bad right so $6.

40 so which is not so bad right so now< now I have $6 in terms of credit if the now I have $6 in terms of credit if the market< market goes up but if the market comes market goes up but if the market comes down< down then I have an opportunity for it down then I have an opportunity for it to< to come into a tent which is now to come into a tent which is now slightly< slightly bigger now how do you know what slightly bigger now how do you know what is< is your max profit well it's actually is your max profit well it's actually pretty< pretty simple all you have to do is just pretty simple all you have to do is just go< go to your p&amp;l graph right if you were go to your p&amp;l graph right if you were to< to go to your p&amp;l graph as you can see to go to your p&amp;l graph as you can see down< down here is at the bottom you can see down here is at the bottom you can see what< what is your max profit right if I was what is your max profit right if I was to< to just hover this by the way I want you to just hover this by the way I want you to< to take a look at this number down here to take a look at this number down here as< as it says p&amp;l on the March 1st uh this as it says p&amp;l on the March 1st uh this is< is at expiration right so at expiration is at expiration right so at expiration this< this is what your max profit will be so this is what your max profit will be so if< if I bring it all the way to the height if I bring it all the way to the height of< of this tent as you can see it says the of this tent as you can see it says the max< $543< $543 right and what about your max loss $543 right and what about your max loss your< your max loss is about your max loss is about $491< $491 so as you can see down here your $491 so as you can see down here your max< max loss to your max profit the RIS max loss to your max profit the RIS ratio< ratio is slightly better than one is to ratio is slightly better than one is to one<. one right because you now make slightly one right because you now make slightly more< more right about more right about $540< $540 compared to your max loss of $540 compared to your max loss of $49< $49 so in terms of risk reward ratio is $49 so in terms of risk reward ratio is actually< actually pretty good right so if you can actually pretty good right so if you can somehow< somehow pin the max profit if you're somehow pin the max profit if you're fortunate< fortunate enough to pin the max profit fortunate enough to pin the max profit then< then even if you have one Max loss later then even if you have one Max loss later on< on it's not going to wipe out the profit on it's not going to wipe out the profit right< right but of course most of the time right but of course most of the time you're< you're not going to hit this uh Max you're not going to hit this uh Max profit< profit down here all right so this is profit down here all right so this is how< how you put on the put broking butterfly how you put on the put broking butterfly this< this 90% win rate strategy and I hope this 90% win rate strategy and I hope you< you like this if you did I really you like this if you did I really appreciate< appreciate if you would give me a thumbs appreciate if you would give me a thumbs up< up on this video by the way if you like up on this video by the way if you like this< this video then you're absolutely going this video then you're absolutely going to< to love this next video which I have for to love this next video which I have for you< you so go ahead and watch that video you so go ahead and watch that video right< right now also if you haven't already right now also if you haven't already gotten< gotten your free copy of the options gotten your free copy of the options income< income blueprint you can do so just by income blueprint you can do so just by clicking< clicking this link down here on your clicking this link down here on your screen< screen and you'll be able to get it for screen and you'll be able to get it for free< free all right I will see you in the free all right I will see you in the next<

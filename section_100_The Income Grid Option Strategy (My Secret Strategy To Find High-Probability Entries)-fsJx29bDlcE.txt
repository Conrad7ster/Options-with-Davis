=====================================================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video I all right alrighty so in today's video I want< want to introduce to you the concept of want to introduce to you the concept of what< what I call the income grid option what I call the income grid option trading< trading methodology and the reason for trading methodology and the reason for this< this is that it helps solves one of the this is that it helps solves one of the biggest< biggest and most pressing questions that biggest and most pressing questions that I< I get and that is knowing where and when I get and that is knowing where and when to< to enter into trades right so I've got a to enter into trades right so I've got a number< number of people who will reach out to number of people who will reach out to me< me ask me you know Davis when is the me ask me you know Davis when is the when< when should I enter into a trade right when should I enter into a trade right when< when should I enter into a credit spread when should I enter into a credit spread when< when should I enter into an iron Condor when should I enter into an iron Condor or< or when's the best time to get into a or when's the best time to get into a trade< trade or how do I know if it's time to trade or how do I know if it's time to enter< enter into a trade or if I should wait enter into a trade or if I should wait so< so this is one of the questions that I so this is one of the questions that I get< get quite a bit and that is why I want get quite a bit and that is why I want to< to introduce to you this concept because to introduce to you this concept because if< if you want to take a look at the chart if you want to take a look at the chart right< right if you just to open up the chart right if you just to open up the chart of< of any uh stocks that you have like in of any uh stocks that you have like in this< this case this is the index ETF the this case this is the index ETF the Russell< Russell 2000 ETF so at this point of Russell 2000 ETF so at this point of time< time you might be wondering to yourself time you might be wondering to yourself you< you know what kind of trade should I put you know what kind of trade should I put right< right should I put a bullish trade a right should I put a bullish trade a bearish< bearish trade you neutral trade or bearish trade you neutral trade or should< should I even enter a trade right now should I even enter a trade right now right< right you have no idea what to do so one right you have no idea what to do so one of< of the things that most people do is of the things that most people do is that< that they'll basically read chart that they'll basically read chart patterns< patterns right maybe they will do head patterns right maybe they will do head and< and shoulders right they will see your and shoulders right they will see your head< head and shoulders pattern you'll see head and shoulders pattern you'll see it's< it's a reversal pattern or they may look it's a reversal pattern or they may look into< into you know Candlestick patterns or into you know Candlestick patterns or some< some will just look into support and some will just look into support and resistance< resistance levels or maybe even resistance levels or maybe even technical< technical indicators so all this can get technical indicators so all this can get pretty< pretty confusing especially when you're pretty confusing especially when you're just< just starting out and the truth of it is just starting out and the truth of it is that< that you actually do not really need to that you actually do not really need to start< start into all this because one of the start into all this because one of the things< things that we don't even really know things that we don't even really know how< how effective it is right and the other how effective it is right and the other thing< thing is that when you're entering into thing is that when you're entering into an< an option trade unlike just normal an option trade unlike just normal trading< trading you know normal trading is when trading you know normal trading is when you< you just buy and sell at the market you just buy and sell at the market price< price you have no idea what's the price you have no idea what's the percentage< percentage that you'll work out right percentage that you'll work out right but< but for whereas for trading options you but for whereas for trading options you already< already have the embedded probability of already have the embedded probability of profit< profit into the strategy where you profit into the strategy where you already< already know what is the probability of already know what is the probability of chances< chances that you will win on that trade chances that you will win on that trade up< up front right so when you already know up front right so when you already know the< the probabilities up front all you need the probabilities up front all you need to< to do is just decide where you're going to do is just decide where you're going to< to enter into the trade right when to enter into the trade right when you're< you're going to enter in the trade so you're going to enter in the trade so one< one of the ways that it's easy for you one of the ways that it's easy for you to< to identify this would be using the to identify this would be using the income< income grid right so this is what I call income grid right so this is what I call the< the income grid option trading the income grid option trading methodology< methodology so basically what it is is methodology so basically what it is is to< to just grid the chart by drawing lines to just grid the chart by drawing lines at< at every fixed dollar interval so as you at every fixed dollar interval so as you can< can see for this I just drew like this can see for this I just drew like this lines< lines down here that is about five lines down here that is about five dollars< dollars apart from each other okay so dollars apart from each other okay so all< all you do is that when you draw this all you do is that when you draw this line< line suddenly it makes it so much easier line suddenly it makes it so much easier for< for you to see the child right you know for you to see the child right you know what< what other different price levels and what other different price levels and then< then at each of these lines this grid then at each of these lines this grid right< right it serves as levels where you can right it serves as levels where you can identify< identify option trading opportunities identify option trading opportunities right< right so let's say for example you don't right so let's say for example you don't have< have any positions down here then you have any positions down here then you can< can just say all right at each of this can just say all right at each of this level level level there's< there's some kind of opportunity that there's some kind of opportunity that can< can present itself right so what you do can present itself right so what you do is< is you will wait until it comes to this is you will wait until it comes to this level< level then you'll see all right so at level then you'll see all right so at this< this point of time I can choose to this point of time I can choose to either< either place a trade or not place a either place a trade or not place a trade< trade so when you have it in this way trade so when you have it in this way right< right basically what you do is that you right basically what you do is that you have< have many different traits at that many have many different traits at that many different< different levels right with differing different levels right with differing strategies< strategies as well so if you were to strategies as well so if you were to watch< watch my previous videos right some of watch my previous videos right some of my< my videos I mentioned that I have many my videos I mentioned that I have many trades< trades on an individual stock right most trades on an individual stock right most of< of the time will be on index ETFs so of the time will be on index ETFs so what< what I do is that I will have all these what I do is that I will have all these levels< levels and each of these levels I'll levels and each of these levels I'll decide< decide whether I want to place a trade decide whether I want to place a trade or< or not right so most of the time I or not right so most of the time I always< always have some kind of trade at each always have some kind of trade at each of< of these levels right so when I have of these levels right so when I have traced< traced each of these different levels I traced each of these different levels I have< have some sort of inbuilt have some sort of inbuilt diversification< diversification inside which is a very diversification inside which is a very important< important thing that you have to important thing that you have to understand< understand because when you have trades understand because when you have trades with< with different strategies at different with different strategies at different levels< levels it is one of the best defenses levels it is one of the best defenses against< against Market crashes you see against Market crashes you see when< when it comes to diversification and I'm when it comes to diversification and I'm sure< sure you heard about the term sure you heard about the term diversification< diversification right you want to diversification right you want to diversify< diversify your portfolio into different diversify your portfolio into different stocks< stocks most of time that's the most stocks most of time that's the most common< common way where you basically just common way where you basically just trade< trade different stocks right so this is trade different stocks right so this is what< what you call horizontal diversification what you call horizontal diversification so< so I'm going to share with you the so I'm going to share with you the difference< difference between horizontal difference between horizontal diversification< diversification versus vertical diversification versus vertical diversification< diversification so horizontal diversification so horizontal diversification< diversification is basically you open up diversification is basically you open up the< the chart right so this is basically the the chart right so this is basically the routine< routine of what most people do when they routine of what most people do when they trade< trade the markets right on each day or trade the markets right on each day or any< any given day they will just open up you any given day they will just open up you know< know their charts they'll have a watch know their charts they'll have a watch list< list and they'll go through each of list and they'll go through each of their< their charts to find trading their charts to find trading opportunities< opportunities right so let's say. for opportunities right so let's say for example< example on Nike example on Nike they< they open a chart on Ikea and they look they open a chart on Ikea and they look at< at the chart and say look at this it's at the chart and say look at this it's bouncing< bouncing off the moving average so they bouncing off the moving average so they have< have a bullish feel so what they do have a bullish feel so what they do maybe< maybe they sell a a bull put spread maybe they sell a a bull put spread right< right which is a vertical spread a right which is a vertical spread a credit< credit spread so you have a short put credit spread so you have a short put and< and then you have a put option which you and then you have a put option which you buy< buy back so this is the blue put spread buy back so this is the blue put spread and< and then they open up the Starbucks and then they open up the Starbucks chart< chart and then they see that oh the chart and then they see that oh the market< market has sold off quite a bit and it market has sold off quite a bit and it looks< looks a little bit bullish because there looks a little bit bullish because there is< is this support below so what they're is this support below so what they're gonna< gonna do is they're gonna sell another gonna do is they're gonna sell another bull< bull put spread again so now you have bull put spread again so now you have two< two trades two trades on< on two different stocks and then they on two different stocks and then they open< open up a third one and then they say oh open up a third one and then they say oh this< this is Disney look at Disney Disney this is Disney look at Disney Disney also< also is pretty oversold so at this point also is pretty oversold so at this point of< of time they may say all right I also of time they may say all right I also want< want to sell another bull put spread want to sell another bull put spread down< down here so in this way you have what down here so in this way you have what you< you call horizontal diversification you call horizontal diversification because< because you have strategies on each of because you have strategies on each of these< these different stocks right so what we these different stocks right so what we are< are trying to achieve or what are trying to achieve or what diversification< diversification really is trying to diversification really is trying to achieve< achieve is to have different uh P L's at achieve is to have different uh P L's at the< the end of day where it's not correlated the end of day where it's not correlated so< so let's say for example you have enough so let's say for example you have enough Capital< Capital to place three credit spreads Capital to place three credit spreads right< right let's say three boot put spread so right let's say three boot put spread so the< the consensus is that it is better for the consensus is that it is better for you< you to place three different boom boot you to place three different boom boot spreads< spreads on the three different stocks spreads on the three different stocks compared< compared to just one stock and then you compared to just one stock and then you have< have three bull put spread correct so have three bull put spread correct so this< this way you have sort of a this way you have sort of a diversification< diversification so in the case maybe diversification so in the case maybe this< this one may go up or this one will go this one may go up or this one will go down< down then this one maybe Will Will just down then this one maybe Will Will just crash< crash so this way you will make money on crash so this way you will make money on this< this one you will probably break even on this one you will probably break even on this< this but this one maybe you will lose this but this one maybe you will lose money< money and then you have your p l money and then you have your p l somewhat< somewhat Diversified right but the somewhat Diversified right but the problem< problem with horizontal diversification problem with horizontal diversification is< is that most people tend to enter them is that most people tend to enter them around< around the same time and by the same around the same time and by the same time< time meaning on the same day or in the time meaning on the same day or in the same< same week right so when you do this same week right so when you do this although< although there is some diversification although there is some diversification in< in terms of the different stocks right in terms of the different stocks right you< you have Nike Starbucks and Walt Disney you have Nike Starbucks and Walt Disney they< they are pretty much in different they are pretty much in different sectors< sectors but the problem is that when the sectors but the problem is that when the market< market crashes everything will crash at market crashes everything will crash at the< the same time they will all start going the same time they will all start going down< down and they will all test your bull down and they will all test your bull put< put spread and you'll see this is what put spread and you'll see this is what actually< actually happened during the crash in actually happened during the crash in the< the during the pandemic and also in 2022 the during the pandemic and also in 2022 right< right so if you have a number of right so if you have a number of positions< positions on positions on sometime< sometime towards the end of 2021 you sometime towards the end of 2021 you will< will notice that a lot of your bullish will notice that a lot of your bullish positions< positions will get tested right so if positions will get tested right so if you< you were to put on this three then guess you were to put on this three then guess what< what all these three will start to crash what all these three will start to crash and< and we will pretty much go through a lot and we will pretty much go through a lot of< of your boot put spread in this case if of your boot put spread in this case if you< you have them on so the other way is you have them on so the other way is called< called vertical diversification so called vertical diversification so instead< instead of you know using different instead of you know using different stocks< stocks and putting all the positions at stocks and putting all the positions at the< the same time instead what you might the same time instead what you might consider< consider doing is putting it on an index consider doing is putting it on an index ETF< ETF right in this case this is the ETF right in this case this is the Russell< Russell 2000 ETF so this way you're not Russell 2000 ETF so this way you're not prone< prone to individual stocks right prone to individual stocks right individual< individual stocks are much more prone to individual stocks are much more prone to individual< individual stock news whereby you know individual stock news whereby you know there's< there's going to be a certain news where there's going to be a certain news where it's< it's going to be Gap up or gap down so it's going to be Gap up or gap down so that< that is why I prefer the index ETF and that is why I prefer the index ETF and then< then for this what you want to do is then for this what you want to do is plot< plot what I call income grid right so plot what I call income grid right so you< you have all these different price you have all these different price levels< levels so instead of entering all at the levels so instead of entering all at the same< same time what you want to do instead is same time what you want to do instead is to< to enter base on different price levels to enter base on different price levels right< right so each time when the price hits right so each time when the price hits any< any of this line you can actually choose any of this line you can actually choose to< to end enter into a trade right can be a to end enter into a trade right can be a bullish< bullish bearish or a neutral trade so bullish bearish or a neutral trade so let's< let's say for example we use the example let's say for example we use the example of< of the blue put spread right as we have of the blue put spread right as we have used< used in the previous slide where you use used in the previous slide where you use three< three different stocks so for example in three different stocks so for example in this< this case let's say you saw that the this case let's say you saw that the market< market has already sold off quite a bit market has already sold off quite a bit and< and it's pretty over extended so now you and it's pretty over extended so now you want< want to get a little bit bullish so want to get a little bit bullish so maybe< maybe you are considering enter the bull maybe you are considering enter the bull put< put spread which is the put credit put spread which is the put credit spread< spread so you might be saying to spread so you might be saying to yourself< yourself all right so once the market yourself all right so once the market comes< comes all the way down to this price comes all the way down to this price level< level 175 when it touches 175 I'm going level 175 when it touches 175 I'm going to< to enter into a bull put spread right so to enter into a bull put spread right so if< if you enter into a bull put spread if you enter into a bull put spread maybe< maybe it will be somewhere down here maybe it will be somewhere down here right< right now at this point of time right if right now at this point of time right if you< you were compared to the horizontal you were compared to the horizontal diversification< diversification you would already have diversification you would already have three< three blue put spreads on right but three blue put spreads on right but instead< instead for this vertical instead for this vertical diversification< diversification you just have one first diversification you just have one first right< right because you want to go according right because you want to go according to< to price levels that means to say let's to price levels that means to say let's say< say if the market drops again to 170 say if the market drops again to 170 then< then you're going to initiate another then you're going to initiate another bull< bull put spread so what this does is bull put spread so what this does is that< that you actually diversifying in terms that you actually diversifying in terms of< of price level and also by different of price level and also by different timing< timing right because maybe a couple of timing right because maybe a couple of days< days have gone or maybe a week has gone days have gone or maybe a week has gone from< from you know from 175 to 170. so at from you know from 175 to 170.

so at this< this time you may be entering into a this time you may be entering into a different< different tenure a maturity date for different tenure a maturity date for your< your options right it could be a your options right it could be a different< different DTE so maybe when you enter different DTE so maybe when you enter this< this this is 45 dce now once the price this this is 45 dce now once the price let's< let's say for example goes from 175 to let's say for example goes from 175 to 170< 170 let's say a week has passed right so 170 let's say a week has passed right so a< a week has passed so you're no longer a week has passed so you're no longer able< able to go on the 45 DT the same because able to go on the 45 DT the same because this< this by that time would have already this by that time would have already become< become somewhere around 38 DTE and become somewhere around 38 DTE and ideally< ideally you know my preference is to go ideally you know my preference is to go around< around 45 DTE and above right to around around 45 DTE and above right to around 60< 60 odd DTE so I wouldn't go for this at 60 odd DTE so I wouldn't go for this at this< this point of time when it goes to 170 this point of time when it goes to 170 so< so I will go for the next nearest 40 5 so I will go for the next nearest 40 5 DTE< DTE to 65 DT right and then so what this DTE to 65 DT right and then so what this means< means is that this will be a new DTE means is that this will be a new DTE compared< compared to the previous one so you can compared to the previous one so you can see< see right now you have diversification see right now you have diversification in< in terms of different strikes right and in terms of different strikes right and you< you also have different time right you also have different time right different< different maturity dates so they will different maturity dates so they will expire< expire at different days so this way you expire at different days so this way you really< really have a much smoother p l so each really have a much smoother p l so each one< one has their. own Theta effect right so one has their own Theta effect right so this< this way when the price actually this way when the price actually rebounds< rebounds right if it goes back up again rebounds right if it goes back up again you< you know you will have a very different you know you will have a very different pnls< pnls right compared to if you have the pnls right compared to if you have the horizontal< horizontal diversification you're going horizontal diversification you're going to< to get all hit at the same time to get all hit at the same time so< so that is why we vertical so that is why we vertical diversification< diversification right it is my diversification right it is my preference< preference compared to you know having preference compared to you know having many< many different stocks and then you are many different stocks and then you are just< just you know entering pretty much the just you know entering pretty much the same< same position on all of them right so in same position on all of them right so in this< this case with vertical diversification this case with vertical diversification right< right you can diversify with different right you can diversify with different price< price level different strike prices price level different strike prices different< different expiration dates and different different expiration dates and different strategies< strategies so the result is that you strategies so the result is that you will< will get a smoother p l with the income will get a smoother p l with the income grid< grid methodology by the way if you like grid methodology by the way if you like this< this video so far Please Subscribe and this video so far Please Subscribe and also< also click the thumbs up button and also also click the thumbs up button and also do< do get your free copy of the options do get your free copy of the options income< income blueprint where I share the top income blueprint where I share the top three< three options strategies that help you three options strategies that help you generate< generate a consistent income each month generate a consistent income each month trading< trading just one to two hours a day trading just one to two hours a day right< right so if you want to go ahead to get right so if you want to go ahead to get this< this copy just head on over to this copy just head on over to optionswithdavis. com< optionswithdavis.

com blueprint all right optionswithdavis. com blueprint all right back< back to the video alright so let's get back to the video alright so let's get into< into the income grid option trading into the income grid option trading methodology< methodology so at each level you have methodology so at each level you have four< four choices so the first choice is to four choices so the first choice is to place< place a bullish option strategy right so place a bullish option strategy right so let's< let's say for example down here you let's say for example down here you could< could see that the price level has been could see that the price level has been hit< hit 175 has been hit so this is where hit 175 has been hit so this is where you< you can choose to place a strategy now you can choose to place a strategy now you< you could choose to place a bullish you could choose to place a bullish strategy< strategy and that could be a short put strategy and that could be a short put all< all right could be a bull put spread it all right could be a bull put spread it could< could be a put ratio spread it could be could be a put ratio spread it could be a< a put broken wing butterfly could be a a put broken wing butterfly could be a damage< damage spread which is the blue called damage spread which is the blue called spread< spread right so for the put ratio spread spread right so for the put ratio spread it's< it's pretty unique because this is a an it's pretty unique because this is a an omnidirectional< omnidirectional trading strategy that omnidirectional trading strategy that means< means that you can adjust it so that means that you can adjust it so that you're< you're slightly more bullish or you can you're slightly more bullish or you can adjust< adjust it so they are slightly more adjust it so they are slightly more bearish< bearish or you can adjust it so you're bearish or you can adjust it so you're more< more neutral right it really UPS to you more neutral right it really UPS to you to< to manage the strikes but basically you to manage the strikes but basically you can< can place any of this bullish strategy can place any of this bullish strategy when< when it comes to this level now the next when it comes to this level now the next choice< choice is that you could place a battery choice is that you could place a battery strategy< strategy so you might think that oh it strategy so you might think that oh it is< is coming here it looks like it's is coming here it looks like it's consolidating< consolidating and looks like it might consolidating and looks like it might push< push further down so in this case you push further down so in this case you maybe< maybe you might want to place a bearish maybe you might want to place a bearish strategy< strategy instead of a bullish strategy strategy instead of a bullish strategy so< so you can place either a bear called so you can place either a bear called spread< spread a bad put spread a put diagonal spread a bad put spread a put diagonal spread< spread it called broken wing butterfly spread it called broken wing butterfly or< or a put ratio spread as well so as you or a put ratio spread as well so as you can< can see there are many different can see there are many different strategies< strategies that you can choose to place strategies that you can choose to place when< when it comes to one of these levels or when it comes to one of these levels or you< you could just choose to place a neutral you could just choose to place a neutral strategy< strategy if you're just not sure what strategy if you're just not sure what it's< it's going to do so if you do not have a it's going to do so if you do not have a bullish< bullish view you do not have a bearish bullish view you do not have a bearish view< view then you can just choose to place a view then you can just choose to place a neutral< neutral strategy right and there are neutral strategy right and there are many< many options as well you can choose to many options as well you can choose to place< place the iron Condor you can choose to place the iron Condor you can choose to place< place the Jade lizard you can choose to place the Jade lizard you can choose to place< place the strangle you can choose to put place the strangle you can choose to put the< the put ratio spread or you could use the put ratio spread or you could use the< the butterfly or the iron fly so as you the butterfly or the iron fly so as you can< can see there are many different ways can see there are many different ways that< that you can enter into a neutral that you can enter into a neutral strategy< strategy and really comes down to you strategy and really comes down to you which< which one you want to place and that is which one you want to place and that is the< the third choice and the fourth choice the third choice and the fourth choice of< of course is that you can just simply do of course is that you can just simply do nothing< nothing right there is no pressure for nothing right there is no pressure for you< you to put on a trade right for example you to put on a trade right for example you< you could see that you know the Market you could see that you know the Market has< has come down to this point down here I has come down to this point down here I don't< don't feel like I want to enter into don't feel like I want to enter into trade< trade yet because I don't have a bullish trade yet because I don't have a bullish view< view I don't have a bearish view I don't view I don't have a bearish view I don't have< have a neutral view so what I want to do have a neutral view so what I want to do is< is I just want to wait and see right is I just want to wait and see right maybe< maybe if the price goes down to this maybe if the price goes down to this level< level then I'll say all right then I level then I'll say all right then I will< will start to get bullish then I will will start to get bullish then I will place< place a bullish strategy or if the place a bullish strategy or if the market< market trades back up to this price then market trades back up to this price then you< you could say all right it looks like you could say all right it looks like it's< it's going sideways then I want to place it's going sideways then I want to place a< a neutral strategy so basically when you a neutral strategy so basically when you have< have this income grid down here it have this income grid down here it eliminates< eliminates the problem or the issue of eliminates the problem or the issue of wondering< wondering when to enter into a trade wondering when to enter into a trade right< right so as long as the prices have right so as long as the prices have reached< reached any of this level you can do reached any of this level you can do something< something so for me personally I do have something so for me personally I do have a< a trade at each of this level so I'll a trade at each of this level so I'll either< either place a bullish trade very either place a bullish trade very straight< straight or a neutral strategy so this straight or a neutral strategy so this way< way I will always be extracting some way I will always be extracting some sort< sort of extrinsic value so for yourself sort of extrinsic value so for yourself if< if you do not have that large of a if you do not have that large of a capital< capital you can pick your places why you capital you can pick your places why you can< can pick where you want to. enter into a can pick where you want to enter into a trade< trade so maybe you could see that all trade so maybe you could see that all right< right I want to only enter into a trade right I want to only enter into a trade if< if the price have moved two levels right if the price have moved two levels right for< for example from down here let's say it for example from down here let's say it goes< goes up two levels from here one level goes up two levels from here one level two< two level then at this point I will two level then at this point I will choose< choose to enter into a trade so at this choose to enter into a trade so at this point< point maybe you say that it's in between point maybe you say that it's in between the< the support and resistance levels so the support and resistance levels so this< this is where I think that the market this is where I think that the market could< could be going sideways so if it's going could be going sideways so if it's going sideways< sideways then you can place a neutral sideways then you can place a neutral strategy< strategy like the iron Condor or maybe strategy like the iron Condor or maybe even< even the strangle if you have the even the strangle if you have the capital< capital and if it starts to go up even capital and if it starts to go up even further< further right it goes another two levels further right it goes another two levels up< up then it's approaching this resistance up then it's approaching this resistance level< level then you could say all right now I level then you could say all right now I want< want to get a little bit bearish because want to get a little bit bearish because it< it seems like the booth has been a it seems like the booth has been a little< little bit overextended and want to get little bit overextended and want to get into<

================================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be talking about how to I'm going to be talking about how to sell< sell put spreads also known as the buo sell put spreads also known as the buo put< put spread for consistent income as a put spread for consistent income as a beginner< beginner so if you're new to trading beginner so if you're new to trading options< options or maybe you've been trading for options or maybe you've been trading for less< less than a year then I'm going to share less than a year then I'm going to share with< with you a very simple way to trade this with you a very simple way to trade this bull< bull put spread so first of all what bull put spread so first of all what exactly< exactly is the bull put spread so the exactly is the bull put spread so the bullo< bullo spread is generally a neutral to bullo spread is generally a neutral to bullish< bullish strategy and by that I mean that bullish strategy and by that I mean that in< in order for you to be profitable on the in order for you to be profitable on the trade< trade the underlying needs to either go trade the underlying needs to either go up< up and this is the fastest way for you up and this is the fastest way for you to< to be profitable or it can even go to be profitable or it can even go sideways< sideways as well right if it goes sideways as well right if it goes sideways< sideways you can still profit on the buo sideways you can still profit on the buo spread< spread and even at times if the market spread and even at times if the market comes< comes down as long as it doesn't go down comes down as long as it doesn't go down too< too much you can still be profitable on too much you can still be profitable on the< the bull spread and I'm going to share the bull spread and I'm going to share with< with you how that works later on now with you how that works later on now next< next how do you exactly construct a next how do you exactly construct a bullo< bullo spread so the bullo spread is bullo spread so the bullo spread is actually< actually very beginner friendly because actually very beginner friendly because there's< there's only two legs to it and by two there's only two legs to it and by two legs< legs I means that there are two option legs I means that there are two option combinations< combinations to this right so the very combinations to this right so the very first< first one is to sell what's called an first one is to sell what's called an outof< outof the money put option so you will outof the money put option so you will see< see this term sometime whenever you you see this term sometime whenever you you know< know watch other videos or when you read know watch other videos or when you read articles< articles you see otm otm just means it's articles you see otm otm just means it's out< out of the money so how do you tell out of the money so how do you tell whether< whether it's out of the money for a put whether it's out of the money for a put option< option so this is something that you option so this is something that you need< need to really understand so let's just need to really understand so let's just say< say right now this is where the current say right now this is where the current market< market price is so there are three market price is so there are three sections< sections in general so you have the sections in general so you have the section< section whereby it's somewhere near section whereby it's somewhere near where< where the current price is and then you where the current price is and then you have< have the one above where the current have the one above where the current price< price is and then you have below where price is and then you have below where the< the current market price is now for a the current market price is now for a put< put option if you choose the strike put option if you choose the strike price< price that is above where the current price that is above where the current market< market price is so somewhere in this market price is so somewhere in this region< region down here then this is what it's region down here then this is what it's called< called in the money right so that is why called in the money right so that is why you< you have the initials itm in the money you have the initials itm in the money now< now if you were to choose the strike now if you were to choose the strike prices< prices somewhere around where the prices somewhere around where the current< current market price is then that's current market price is then that's what's< what's called at the money or ATM for what's called at the money or ATM for short< short now if you were to choose the short now if you were to choose the strike< strike prices that is below where the strike prices that is below where the current< current market price is then this whole current market price is then this whole region< region down here is what's called out of region down here is what's called out of the< the money and when you're trading the the money and when you're trading the bull< bull put spread you want to select the bull put spread you want to select the strike< strike prices that are out of the money strike prices that are out of the money right< right so you start off by selling and right so you start off by selling and out< out of the money put option and then you out of the money put option and then you buy< buy a further out of the money put buy a further out of the money put option< option down here and the purpose of this option down here and the purpose of this further< further out of the money put option is further out of the money put option is so< so that you kept your max risk right so that you kept your max risk right because< because there could be times whereby the because there could be times whereby the market< market will just go all the way down market will just go all the way down right< right it could even crash but you do not right it could even crash but you do not have< have to worry if you have this long put have to worry if you have this long put in< in place because this long put really in place because this long put really just< just capts the max risk so whatever you just capts the max risk so whatever you risk< risk for the trade you cannot lose more risk for the trade you cannot lose more than< than that even if the the market really than that even if the the market really goes< goes past your whole put spread so this goes past your whole put spread so this is< is a very important part of constructing is a very important part of constructing your< your bull put spread now how do you make your bull put spread now how do you make money< money on the bull put spread so when you money on the bull put spread so when you sell< sell the bull put spread you receive sell the bull put spread you receive what's< what's called a credit right this is what's called a credit right this is also< also what's known as premium so also what's known as premium so sometimes< sometimes when you hear other people sometimes when you hear other people talk< talk about you know I receive this talk about you know I receive this amount< amount of credit I receive amount of amount of credit I receive amount of Premium< Premium or I'm doing premium selling Premium or I'm doing premium selling strategies< strategies it what it just means is that strategies it what it just means is that they< they receive some money up front for they receive some money up front for putting< putting on the trade right so this is putting on the trade right so this is how< how this credit strategies work like how this credit strategies work like bull< bull put spread you receive uh amount of bull put spread you receive uh amount of money< money up front and this is already money up front and this is already deposited< deposited into your account and then deposited into your account and then from< from there you put on the trade you from there you put on the trade you trade< trade it okay so as you can see down trade it okay so as you can see down here< here the credit very simply is whatever here the credit very simply is whatever it's< it's shown on your trading platform it's shown on your trading platform right< right so on your trading platform so for right so on your trading platform so for this< this this is tasty trade so whatever this this is tasty trade so whatever platform< platform you're using it should tell you platform you're using it should tell you what< what is the credit that you're getting what is the credit that you're getting so< so if you see a credit that's so if you see a credit that's $14< $14 it just means that you're receiving $14 it just means that you're receiving a< a amount of a amount of $114< $114 per buo spread because each bull $114 per buo spread because each bull put< put spread or each option contract put spread or each option contract actually< actually controls 800 shares right so actually controls 800 shares right so this< this credit that you receive is also the this credit that you receive is also the max< max profit on the trade right as you can max profit on the trade right as you can see< see down here this column or rather this see down here this column or rather this box< box in green shows your max profit is box in green shows your max profit is $114< $114 which is the same as the credit $114 which is the same as the credit which< which you receive so when you put on the which you receive so when you put on the bo< bo spread whatever you receive upfront bo spread whatever you receive upfront that< that is the most that you can make now that is the most that you can make now that< that is not to say that you will keep that is not to say that you will keep everything< everything of it it really depends on everything of it it really depends on how< how you put on the trade how you manage how you put on the trade how you manage it< it and I'll talk about it a little bit it and I'll talk about it a little bit more< more later on now to be profitable on more later on now to be profitable on the< the trade you need to close out the the trade you need to close out the trade< trade for lesser than what you had sold trade for lesser than what you had sold the< the bull put spread for okay so for the bull put spread for okay so for example< example if you sold the bull spread for example if you sold the bull spread for a11< a11 14 so this is the credit you a11 14 so this is the credit you received< received the premium that you got you received the premium that you got you need< need to buy back the buo spread for less need to buy back the buo spread for less than than than $114< $114 so for example if you bought it $114 so for example if you bought it back< back for 14 cents that means you gain $1 back for 14 cents that means you gain $1 on< on the trade so this equates to $100 per on the trade so this equates to $100 per bull< bull put spread so when you're trading bull put spread so when you're trading credit< credit strategies for example this bull credit strategies for example this bull put< put spread what you're actually doing is put spread what you're actually doing is that< that you're selling at a higher price that you're selling at a higher price and< and you want to buy back at a lower and you want to buy back at a lower price< price now what if you bought the buut price now what if you bought the buut spread< spread for higher than what you actually spread for higher than what you actually sold< sold it for for so let's say if you sold it for for so let's say if you bought< bought the buut spread back for bought the. buut spread back for $214< $214 in this case it means you lost a $214 in this case it means you lost a doll< doll on this trade which equates to $100 doll on this trade which equates to $100 per< per bull put spread so this is the whole per bull put spread so this is the whole idea< idea of the bullo spread right you want idea of the bullo spread right you want to< to buy back the trade or close the trade to buy back the trade or close the trade for< for lesser than what you received the for lesser than what you received the credit< credit for and if you leave it to credit for and if you leave it to expiration< expiration what it just means that it expiration what it just means that it becomes< becomes zero right so if you sold it for becomes zero right so if you sold it for $114< $114 and then you leave to expiration $114 and then you leave to expiration and< and it expires out out of the money and it expires out out of the money worthless< worthless it just means that the spread worthless it just means that the spread becomes< becomes 0 and you receive the full becomes 0 and you receive the full premium< premium of this whole buut spread trade premium of this whole buut spread trade so< so now that we've already talked about so now that we've already talked about what's< what's the max profit you can make on what's the max profit you can make on the< the poer spread what about the max risk the poer spread what about the max risk right< right what is the max loss that you can right what is the max loss that you can get< get on the buut spread so it's actually get on the buut spread so it's actually also< also very simple to calculate so it's also very simple to calculate so it's basically< basically the width of the spread minus basically the width of the spread minus the< the credit that you receive so what is the credit that you receive so what is the< the width of the spread the width of the the width of the spread the width of the spread< spread basically is the distance between spread basically is the distance between the< the strike price that you chose of the the strike price that you chose of the short< short putut and the long put right so short putut and the long put right so for< for example in this example down here for example in this example down here the< the short putut down here would be at the short putut down here would be at the< the strike price of 555 and then the the strike price of 555 and then the long< long put would be at the strike price of long put would be at the strike price of 550< 550 so what is the width of this bull 550 so what is the width of this bull put< put spread well the width is just simply put spread well the width is just simply $5< $5 right you take 555 minus 550 that $5 right you take 555 minus 550 that means< means to say your max loss is $5 minus means to say your max loss is $5 minus whatever< whatever credit that you receive so this whatever credit that you receive so this credit< credit you receive is $1 14 so as you credit you receive is $1 14 so as you can< can see down here the example if you can see down here the example if you sell< sell $5 you receive $1 14 then your max sell $5 you receive $1 14 then your max risk< risk is $5 minus $14 which is risk is $5 minus $14 which is $386< $386 that means your max loss is $386 that means your max loss is $386< $386 per buut spread so again you can $386 per buut spread so again you can just< just confirm this in your ticket your just confirm this in your ticket your order< order ticket when you put on the trade order ticket when you put on the trade before< before you put on the trade you must before you put on the trade you must always< always check what is the max loss what always check what is the max loss what is< is the max profit you're going to get is the max profit you're going to get and< and see that you're comfortable with and see that you're comfortable with that< that right so as you can see down here that right so as you can see down here it's it's it's $386< $386 in this red box down here so this $386 in this red box down here so this confirms< confirms that our Max loss is this confirms that our Max loss is this amount< amount now the question you might have amount now the question you might have down< down here after seeing the max profit down here after seeing the max profit and< and the max loss is why is the bull put and the max loss is why is the bull put spread< spread Max loss more than the max profit spread Max loss more than the max profit right< right as you can see down here if you right as you can see down here if you lose< lose you lose lose you lose $386< $386 but if you win you only win $386 but if you win you only win $114< $114 so the risk reward down here is $114 so the risk reward down here is like< like you're risking roughly $3 plus just like you're risking roughly $3 plus just to< to make $1 so you might be wondering why to make $1 so you might be wondering why is< is it like that well that's because is it like that well that's because firstly< firstly it's just the design of a credit firstly it's just the design of a credit style< style strategy when you trade a premium style strategy when you trade a premium selling< selling strategy what you notice is that selling strategy what you notice is that you< you always get the characteristic where you always get the characteristic where the< the risk is more than the re report the risk is more than the re report however< however it's actually just a tradeoff so however it's actually just a tradeoff so while< while the max profit is lesser than the while the max profit is lesser than the max< max loss is actually being compensated max loss is actually being compensated by< by a higher probability of profit also by a higher probability of profit also known< known as the win rate it just means that known as the win rate it just means that you're< you're going to get a higher win rate you're going to get a higher win rate which< which is more than a 50% chance to be which is more than a 50% chance to be profitable< profitable right so as you can see down profitable right so as you can see down here< here the pop here which is the here the pop here which is the probability< probability of profit is 66% right this probability of profit is 66% right this is< is more than a 50% win rate so for is more than a 50% win rate so for example< example if we compare it to just buying example if we compare it to just buying the< the stock out right at the current the stock out right at the current market< market price from a simple probability market price from a simple probability standpoint< standpoint there's a 50/50 chance you're standpoint there's a 50/50 chance you're going< going to make or lose money right it's going to make or lose money right it's like< like a coin flip right if it goes up like a coin flip right if it goes up you're< you're going to make money on the trade you're going to make money on the trade if< if it goes down you're going to lose if it goes down you're going to lose money< money on the trade now if you sold the money on the trade now if you sold the bull< bull put spread you will notice you bull put spread you will notice you actually< actually have a bigger profit Zone A actually have a bigger profit Zone A Wider< Wider profit zone for you to make money Wider profit zone for you to make money in< in so naturally you would have more than in so naturally you would have more than a< a 50% chance to be profitable because a 50% chance to be profitable because the< the market can still go up go sideways the market can still go up go sideways and< and even go down you can still make and even go down you can still make money< money so this is what I mean so as you money so this is what I mean so as you can< can see down here this green box down can see down here this green box down here< here is the profit zone of putting on here is the profit zone of putting on this< this bull P spread you can see it's much this bull P spread you can see it's much wider< wider than if you were to go for the wider than if you were to go for the outright< outright trading right if you just buy outright trading right if you just buy the< the stock outright only half of it is the stock outright only half of it is profitable< profitable the other half is a loss but profitable the other half is a loss but for< for the buo spread you have a much wider for the buo spread you have a much wider profit< profit Zone and that is why your risk to profit Zone and that is why your risk to reward< reward ratio is not as good right you reward ratio is not as good right you usually< usually risk more to make less and you usually risk more to make less and you notice< notice one thing as well is that if the notice one thing as well is that if the market< market actually goes down below your market actually goes down below your short< short putut you can actually still be short putut you can actually still be profitable< profitable and why is that so why profitable and why is that so why because< because you actually receive the credit because you actually receive the credit for< for putting on the trade so when you for putting on the trade so when you receive< receive a credit it actually helps lower receive a credit it actually helps lower the< the break even point for the trade so the break even point for the trade so remember< remember the max loss of your bull push remember the max loss of your bull push spread< spread is the width of the spread so as spread is the width of the spread so as you< you can see this is the width of the you can see this is the width of the spread< spread which in our example is $5 but spread which in our example is $5 but then< then you have to minus off the credit then you have to minus off the credit that< that you receive right minus the credit that you receive right minus the credit so< so this green box down here the small so this green box down here the small little< little portion where it came down a little portion where it came down a little< little bit into the Poo spread that's little bit into the Poo spread that's because< because of the offset from the credit because of the offset from the credit the< the next question that you probably the next question that you probably would< would have and a lot of people would would have and a lot of people would have< have as especially if they're new to have as especially if they're new to trading< trading options they will say hey Davis trading options they will say hey Davis wouldn't< wouldn't just one Max loss wipe out many wouldn't just one Max loss wipe out many of< of your

com blueprint all right< right back to the video and the answer right back to the video and the answer is< is this yes if you number one you is this yes if you number one you construct< construct your boooo spread with a very construct your boooo spread with a very low< low Delta right some people like to go low Delta right some people like to go very< very very far out the money for example very very far out the money for example you< you can see in this picture down here you can see in this picture down here this< this buo spread is consider out the this buo spread is consider out the money< money and it's below where the current money and it's below where the current market< market price is but some people want to market price is but some people want to push< push this whole spread down here even push this whole spread down here even further< further out of the money they want to further out of the money they want to make< make it even lower so this profit Zone make it even lower so this profit Zone will< will become even wider and this is where will become even wider and this is where the< the problem arises because if you were the problem arises because if you were to< to stretch it so far out of the money to stretch it so far out of the money then< then this is where you can have this then this is where you can have this kind< kind of risk to reward ratio whereby the kind of risk to reward ratio whereby the max< max risk is so much bigger than the max risk is so much bigger than the reward< reward you get so as you can see down reward you get so as you can see down here< here your reward is here your reward is $21< $21 but when you lose you're going to $21 but when you lose you're going to lose lose lose $479< $479 so this is one of the problems $479 so this is one of the problems where< where beginners have when they construct where beginners have when they construct it< it because they want this very high win it because they want this very high win rate< rate as you can see down here this win rate as you can see down here this win rate< rate down here is 95% you can win a lot rate down here is 95% you can win a lot but< but that doesn't mean that you won't but that doesn't mean that you won't lose< lose money remember every time when you lose money remember every time when you see< see a pop that has 95% or 90% what it see a pop that has 95% or 90% what it just< just means is that there is a 5% or 10% just means is that there is a 5% or 10% chance< chance that you're going to lose money chance that you're going to lose money and< and you don't want to think as though and you don't want to think as though hey< hey it's 95% chance right most likely I hey it's 95% chance right most likely I want< want to lose money no that doesn't mean want to lose money no that doesn't mean that< that if you trade long enough that 5% that if you trade long enough that 5% loss< loss is going to come and it also loss is going to come and it also depends< depends how you're going to manage the depends how you're going to manage the trade< trade because if you're going to let trade because if you're going to let this< this 5% loss become a Max loss then of this 5% loss become a Max loss then of course< course you're going to wipe out many of course you're going to wipe out many of your< your small gains with One Max loss so your small gains with One Max loss so the< the second reason why many people have the second reason why many people have this< this uh problem of having One Max loss this uh problem of having One Max loss wiping< wiping up many games is because you let wiping up many games is because you let yourself< yourself get a Max loss right there is yourself get a Max loss right there is no< no reason why you want to get into a Max no reason why you want to get into a Max loss< loss because you can actually reduce the loss because you can actually reduce the chances< chances of you getting that Max loss and chances of you getting that Max loss and how< how do you do that well this is why you how do you do that well this is why you want< want to implement proper trade want to implement proper trade management< management so you avoid getting the max management so you avoid getting the max loss< loss so for example if you exit latest loss so for example if you exit latest at< at 21 days to expiration or DTE then at 21 days to expiration or DTE then your< your average loss actually becomes much your average loss actually becomes much lesser< lesser than if you were to hold all the lesser than if you were to hold all the way< way to expression so many beginners when way to expression so many beginners when they< they trade this put spread they always they trade this put spread they always think< think that they need to hold the trade think that they need to hold the trade all< all the way to exploration in fact that all the way to exploration in fact that is< is not necessarily the best way to trade is not necessarily the best way to trade the< the put spread in many cases you the put spread in many cases you actually< actually want to get out earlier and as actually want to get out earlier and as you< you can see down here this study down you can see down here this study down here< here is by the tasty trade team whereby here is by the tasty trade team whereby they've< they've really started this put spread they've really started this put spread very< very extensively and they tested it out very extensively and they tested it out right< right they tested it out with different right they tested it out with different exits< exits so you can see down here they are exits so you can see down here they are two< two different types of exits the first two different types of exits the first exit< exit is to hold all the way to exit is to hold all the way to expiration< expiration now the other exit is to get expiration now the other exit is to get out< out early and by getting out early it out early and by getting out early it just< just means that when there's 21 days to just means that when there's 21 days to expiration< expiration left in the option they just expiration left in the option they just exit< exit the trade right for example if you exit the trade right for example if you put< put on the trade for 45 DTE so when you put on the trade for 45 DTE so when you look< look at the option chain you look at the look at the option chain you look at the DTE< DTE it says 45 this is when you first DTE it says 45 this is when you first put< put it on now when a number of days go put it on now when a number of days go by< by this DTE actually starts to drop by this DTE actually starts to drop because< because there's lesser and lesser days because there's lesser and lesser days left< left to exploration so once it reaches left to exploration so once it reaches 21< 21 DTE that means there's 21 days left 21 DTE that means there's 21 days left to< to the expiration of the trade not to the expiration of the trade not holding< holding for 21 days right a big holding for 21 days right a big difference< difference you're not holding for 21 difference you're not holding for 21 days< days rather you hold the trade until days rather you hold the trade until there's< there's 21 days left to the expiration there's 21 days left to the expiration of< of the trade then you exit it so as you of the trade then you exit it so as you can< can see based on your study right they can see based on your study right they did< did two different tests between the $5 did two different tests between the $5 wide< wide put spread and the $10 wide put wide put spread and the $10 wide put spread< spread and what they found is that if spread and what they found is that if you< you were to exit the trade much earlier you were to exit the trade much earlier at< at 21 DTE your average loss becomes so at 21 DTE your average loss becomes so much< much more lesser compared to if you were much more lesser compared to if you were to< to get out expiration you see if you get to get out expiration you see if you get out< out expiration the max loss is so much out expiration the max loss is so much bigger< bigger but if you get out earlier you bigger but if you get out earlier you actually< actually get lesser loss now that is not actually get lesser loss now that is not to< to say that you're going to get a worse to say that you're going to get a worse performance< performance because again according to performance because again according to the< the test you can see the annual Roc you the test you can see the annual Roc you actually< actually get a higher return if you were actually get a higher return if you were to< to get out earlier compared to if you to get out earlier compared to if you were< were to exit experation so if you want were to exit experation so if you want to< to avoid this issue whereby hey just one to avoid this issue whereby hey just one Max< Max loss is going to wipe out so many of Max loss is going to wipe out so many of my< my game I don't think this bu spread is my game I don't think this bu spread is going< going to work that all you got to do is going to work that all you got to do is to< to exit earlier because when you do that to exit earlier because when you do that you'll< you'll find that your losses are control you'll find that your losses are control your< your overall performance of the trade is your overall performance of the trade is going< going to become better so you might be going to become better so you might be wondering< wondering why is it that you know if I wondering why is it that you know if I exit< exit at 21 DTE my loss is actually exit at 21 DTE my loss is actually lesser< lesser and here's the reason why what lesser and here's the reason why what you< you see on your p&amp;l graph right as you you see on your p&amp;l graph right as you can< can see down here this uh line down here can see down here this uh line down here that< that I've just drawn this is your p&amp;l at that I've just drawn this is your p&amp;l at expiration< expiration so how do you see this graph expiration so how do you see this graph basically< basically the green color portion is basically the green color portion is where< where you start to make money the rate where you start to make money the rate portion< portion is where you lose money but at portion is where you lose money but at expiration< expiration so what you can see down here expiration so what you can see down here this< this dotted line down here is where the this dotted line down here is where the current< current market price is so if the market current market price is so if the market actually< actually goes up from where the current actually goes up from where the current market< market price is you're in a profit now market price is you're in a profit now if< if it goes down and it goes low enough if it goes down and it goes low enough you're< you're actually going to be in a loss you're actually going to be in a loss but< but you actually do not hit the max loss but you actually do not hit the max loss until< until expiration right many people think until expiration right many people think that< that hey if it goes below into the rate that hey if it goes below into the rate zone< zone you're going to lose this Max loss zone you're going to lose this Max loss down< down here but that is not true because down here but that is not true because what< what you actually lose it actually comes what you actually lose it actually comes down< down to this blue line down here do you down to this blue line down here do you see< see this blue line over here so this see this blue line over here so this blue< blue line down here keeps changing every blue line down here keeps changing every single< single day right as it gets closer and single day right as it gets closer and closer< closer to expiration so basically this closer to expiration so basically this blue< blue line down. here will slowly slowly blue line down here will slowly slowly change< change and become this line down here at change and become this line down here at expiration< expiration so this blue line down here expiration so this blue line down here is< is just at 21 days left to expiration so is just at 21 days left to expiration so what< what you notice is that if the market what you notice is that if the market actually< actually comes down to this point Point actually comes down to this point Point down< down here your loss at 21 DTE is down here your loss at 21 DTE is actually< actually much lesser because this is actually much lesser because this is where< where your actual loss is compared to if where your actual loss is compared to if you< you were hold to expiration if you hold you were hold to expiration if you hold to< to expiration your loss is here and this to expiration your loss is here and this is< is the Zer Mark right so anything below is the Zer Mark right so anything below here< here you start to lose more and more and here you start to lose more and more and more< more and anything above the zero line more and anything above the zero line you're< you're going to be in a bigger profit so you're going to be in a bigger profit so you< you can see that once you get out 21 DTE you can see that once you get out 21 DTE regardless< regardless where it is on the graph so regardless where it is on the graph so for< for example if you reach a point say for example if you reach a point say somewhere< somewhere around here then you actually somewhere around here then you actually lose< lose lesser right so that is why when lose lesser right so that is why when you< you cut off at 21 DTE as this data you cut off at 21 DTE as this data suggests< suggests you're actually going to have a suggests you're actually going to have a much< much smaller average loss so if you're much smaller average loss so if you're afraid< afraid that One Max loss is going to afraid that One Max loss is going to wipe< wipe out your trade just exit at 21 DTE wipe out your trade just exit at 21 DTE now< now the next question you might be now the next question you might be asking< asking Davis what if I wanted a strategy asking Davis what if I wanted a strategy that< that has a higher risk Bo ratio for that has a higher risk Bo ratio for example< example I want a strategy that gives me example I want a strategy that gives me you< you know a risk reward of one is to you know a risk reward of one is to three< three right risk $1 to make $3 then the three right risk $1 to make $3 then the answer< answer to this is that if you want to answer to this is that if you want to then< then you cannot trade premium selling then you cannot trade premium selling strategies< strategies but instead you want to trade strategies but instead you want to trade premium< premium buying strategies because all premium buying strategies because all premium< premium selling strategies basically premium selling strategies basically have< have this characteristic whereby you're have this characteristic whereby you're going< going to risk more than what you make going to risk more than what you make and< and the trade-off is that you're going and the trade-off is that you're going to< to have a higher win rate but if you to have a higher win rate but if you insist< insist on getting a better risk to insist on getting a better risk to reward< reward ratio where you actually get more reward ratio where you actually get more reward< reward than you're risking then this reward than you're risking then this case< case you might want to go for premium case you might want to go for premium buying< buying strategies so as you can see I've buying strategies so as you can see I've constructed< constructed one down here which is a constructed one down here which is a debit< debit spread this is the call debit debit spread this is the call debit spread< spread also what's known as The Bull spread also what's known as The Bull call< call spread so straight away you can see call spread so straight away you can see down< down here your risk work ratio is much down here your risk work ratio is much better< better than a one is to one right you're better than a one is to one right you're risking< risking $148 to make risking $148 to make $352< $352 so this is roughly you know you $352 so this is roughly you know you risk< risk a dollar to make roughly risk a dollar to make roughly $220< $220 or 30 C or so so this is the kind $220 or 30 C or so so this is the kind of< of strategies you want to go for if you of strategies you want to go for if you want< want to go for a higher risk reward want to go for a higher risk reward ratio ratio ratio however< however very important there is a however very important there is a trade-off< trade-off what is trade-off with getting trade-off what is trade-off with getting a< a good risk reward ratio the trade-off a good risk reward ratio the trade-off is< is that your win rate right your is that your win rate right your probability< probability of profit is actually so probability of profit is actually so much< much lower as you can see down here this much lower as you can see down here this is< is 30% compared to previously where I is 30% compared to previously where I show< show you the bullo spread structure that show you the bullo spread structure that is< is about 66% right it's more than two is about 66% right it's more than two times< times the win rate so you can see times the win rate so you can see straight< straight away this is a trade-off and straight away this is a trade-off and there< there is one big problem to trade this there is one big problem to trade this strategy< strategy as a beginner and this is strategy as a beginner and this is something< something that many people don't something that many people don't understand< understand and that is the psychological understand and that is the psychological part< part if you were to trade this strategy part if you were to trade this strategy with< with a low win rate what you will find with a low win rate what you will find is< is that over time you'll find it very is that over time you'll find it very difficult< difficult for you to continue putting on difficult for you to continue putting on this< this strategy now that is not to say this strategy now that is not to say that< that you know the debit strategy is not that you know the debit strategy is not profitable< profitable it can be profitable it's profitable it can be profitable it's just< just that the journey for you to have a just that the journey for you to have a consistent< consistent profit or to see the upside consistent profit or to see the upside over< over a long term can be quite difficult over a long term can be quite difficult because< because of one problem and the big because of one problem and the big problem< problem is the potential losing streak problem is the potential losing streak right< right so the problem with low win rate right so the problem with low win rate is< is that you have to sit through all this is that you have to sit through all this long< long losing streak and still be able to long losing streak and still be able to stick< stick with the strategy so for example stick with the strategy so for example if< if you were to take a look at this 30% if you were to take a look at this 30% win< win rate so this table down here win rate so this table down here basically< basically is the probability of X basically is the probability of X consecutive< consecutive losing trades within a 100 consecutive losing trades within a 100 Trade< Trade sequence that means to say how Trade sequence that means to say how many< many losing trades you have in a row many losing trades you have in a row when< when you trade total about 100 trades as when you trade total about 100 trades as you< you can see in this table down here at you can see in this table down here at the< the top it shows the uh number of the top it shows the uh number of consecutive< consecutive losses this number down here consecutive losses this number down here and< and this table shows the win rate so and this table shows the win rate so five< five down here just means there are five five down here just means there are five consecutive< consecutive losses in a row that means consecutive losses in a row that means you< you lose you lose you lose you lose you you lose you lose you lose you lose you lose< lose five in a row and you can see for a lose five in a row and you can see for a 30%< 30% win rate strategy there is a 30% win rate strategy there is a guaranteed< guaranteed chance that you can have guaranteed chance that you can have eight< eight losses in a row when you put on at eight losses in a row when you put on at least< least 100 trades or more now how many of least 100 trades or more now how many of you< you are able able to sit through eight you are able able to sit through eight losing< losing streaks I've spoken to a number losing streaks I've spoken to a number of< of people and recently I spoke to of people and recently I spoke to someone< someone right he told me that as long as someone right he told me that as long as he< he has two losses in a row he's going to he has two losses in a row he's going to stop< stop the strategy he stopped trading it stop the strategy he stopped trading it right< right so as you can see if you were to right so as you can see if you were to trade< trade this called debit spread straight trade this called debit spread straight away< away after two losses if you're going to away after two losses if you're going to quit< quit you're never going to see the quit you're never going to see the upside< upside of the strategy even though it's upside of the strategy even though it's going< going to be profitable in the longterm going to be profitable in the longterm so< so you can see down here there is uh so you can see down here there is uh even< even a 93% of 10 losses in a row that even a 93% of 10 losses in a row that means< means sooner or later you trade long means sooner or later you trade long enough< enough you will reach a point whereby enough you will reach a point whereby there's< there's 10 losses in a row now on the there's 10 losses in a row now on the other< other hand if you go for maybe a 70% win other hand if you go for maybe a 70% win rate< rate strategy the number of consecutive rate strategy the number of consecutive losing< losing trades you're going to have is losing trades you're going to have is much< much lesser right as you can see down much lesser right as you can see down here< here it's only a guaranteed two losses here it's only a guaranteed two losses in< in a row out of a 100 trades that you in a row out of a 100 trades that you put< put on and you can have up to 55% pretty put on and you can have up to 55% pretty much< much a coin flip when it comes to four much a coin flip when it comes to four losses< losses in a row and you can see it just losses in a row and you can see it just dramatically< dramatically uh falls off the dramatically uh falls off the probability< probability the number of losses that probability the number of losses that means< means the chances of you actually means the chances of you actually getting< getting five losses in a row six losses getting five losses in a row six losses in< in a row and so on is getting lesser and in a row and so on is getting lesser and lesser< lesser so when you compare these two lesser so when you compare these two strategies< strategies which one do you think is strategies which one do you think is easier< easier for you to put on the trade easier for you to put on the trade especially< especially if you're new to trading especially if you're new to trading right< right many beginners new to trading they right many beginners new to trading they just< just want to see wins right even I spoke just want to see wins right even I spoke to< to a person recently he has put on this to a person recently he has put on this uh< uh High win rate strategy which is about uh High win rate strategy which is about 80< 80 something per. but just one loss has 80 something per.

but just one loss has already< already they shooked him up he has one already they shooked him up he has one loss< loss and he stopped trading the strategy loss and he stopped trading the strategy because< because they just cannot accept the loss because they just cannot accept the loss so< so that is why you need to understand so that is why you need to understand the< the difference between a debit strategy the difference between a debit strategy and< and a credit strategy now next I want to and a credit strategy now next I want to compare< compare the bull put spread against the compare the bull put spread against the shut< shut so why the bull put spread instead shut so why the bull put spread instead of< of short put so if you have been of short put so if you have been watching< watching a number of YouTube videos watching a number of YouTube videos you've< you've seen a lot of people talk about you've seen a lot of people talk about hey< hey sell the shut for passive income hey sell the shut for passive income sell< sell the shut for consistent profits sell the shut for consistent profits right< right and I've also created a few videos right and I've also created a few videos on< on that as well but why do I suggest the on that as well but why do I suggest the pull< pull spread instead of the short putut pull spread instead of the short putut for< for beginners Well the reason is because for beginners Well the reason is because number< number one the short putut requires a number one the short putut requires a much< much bigger Capital so in options term much bigger Capital so in options term we< we use the word uh buying power we use the word uh buying power requirement< requirement right so you will hear this requirement right so you will hear this quite< quite often so basically it's just the quite often so basically it's just the money< money you have to put up to the broker money you have to put up to the broker to< to place the trade and that is why with to place the trade and that is why with a< a short putut you notice the buying a short putut you notice the buying power< power requirement is actually much power requirement is actually much bigger< bigger you can see down here the buying bigger you can see down here the buying power< power effect for a short putut is power effect for a short putut is $10,000< $10,000 over dollars and if you were to $10,000 over dollars and if you were to see< see the max loss is see the max loss is $54,000< $54,000 because this is what's called an $54,000 because this is what's called an undefined< undefined risk strategy whereby there's undefined risk strategy whereby there's no< no protection to the downside if the no protection to the downside if the market< market keeps going all the way down market keeps going all the way down crashes< crashes immediately like a flesh crash crashes immediately like a flesh crash you're< you're going to lose a lot of money so you're going to lose a lot of money so if< if the underlying crashes you can lose if the underlying crashes you can lose more< more than the capital you put up for the more than the capital you put up for the trade< trade so as you can see you put up trade so as you can see you put up $10,000< $10,000 Plus for the trade you can $10,000 Plus for the trade you can potentially< potentially lose more than that now on potentially lose more than that now on the< the other hand the buo spread requires a the other hand the buo spread requires a much< much smaller capital and caps the Max much smaller capital and caps the Max risk< risk even if the market goes to zero risk even if the market goes to zero right< right you cannot lose more than what you right you cannot lose more than what you put< put up for the capital so as you can see put up for the capital so as you can see down< down here the buying power effect or the down here the buying power effect or the capital< capital you put up for the trade is capital you put up for the trade is $386< $386 what is the max loss the max loss $386 what is the max loss the max loss is< is the same it's is the same it's $386< $386 that means to say even if the $386 that means to say even if the market< market crashes all the way to zero you market crashes all the way to zero you still< still do not have to worry because you still do not have to worry because you cannot< cannot lose more than what you put up cannot lose more than what you put up for< for the trade so that is why for for the trade so that is why for beginners< beginners I really only suggest for you beginners I really only suggest for you to< to put on the bull push spread unless to put on the bull push spread unless you< you do not mind getting assigned the you do not mind getting assigned the shares< shares of the underly so the only time shares of the underly so the only time that< that I would suggest to trade the short that I would suggest to trade the short putut< putut is if you plan to actually go long putut is if you plan to actually go long the< the shares of the underline maybe you the shares of the underline maybe you want< want to collect the stocks maybe it is want to collect the stocks maybe it is that< that you're trading the wheel strategy that you're trading the wheel strategy then< then yes you can go for the short putut then yes you can go for the short putut but< but if you're planning to just trade the but if you're planning to just trade the options< options that means you want to get in options that means you want to get in and< and get out the options you do not want and get out the options you do not want to< to get into shares then the buo put to get into shares then the buo put spread< spread will be a better strategy for you spread will be a better strategy for you so< so finally how do you trade the bupo so finally how do you trade the bupo spread< spread so if you a beginner you're new spread so if you a beginner you're new to< to trading options then I'm going to to trading options then I'm going to share< share with you a very simple way to share with you a very simple way to trade< trade the bullo spread now this is not trade the bullo spread now this is not the< the only way to trade it but I suggest the only way to trade it but I suggest this< this as a way to trade it because it's this as a way to trade it because it's going< going to be simple and it's going to put going to be simple and it's going to put the< the odds in your favor so there are a the odds in your favor so there are a few< few steps for this so the very first few steps for this so the very first step< step first of all just find stocks that step first of all just find stocks that are< are in an uptrend what do you mean by are in an uptrend what do you mean by uptrend< uptrend well uptrend basically you can uptrend well uptrend basically you can see< see that this a wave pattern where it's see that this a wave pattern where it's forming< forming where it's forming all this forming where it's forming all this higher< higher highs and higher lows that means higher highs and higher lows that means you< you know that the market has a momentum you know that the market has a momentum that< that is going up now the second step is that is going up now the second step is to< to add the indicator called the to add the indicator called the stochastic< stochastic oscillator right the stochastic oscillator right the stochastic< stochastic oscillator basically what it stochastic oscillator basically what it does< does is it measures overbought and does is it measures overbought and oversold< oversold conditions in the market oversold conditions in the market overbought< overbought just means that the market overbought just means that the market has< has gone up quite a bit and it seems has gone up quite a bit and it seems exhausted< exhausted and oversaw just means the exhausted and oversaw just means the opposite< opposite right the market has gone down opposite right the market has gone down for< for quite a bit and it seems exhausted for quite a bit and it seems exhausted so< so anything that is above this red line so anything that is above this red line at< at the top so as you can see down here at the top so as you can see down here this< this is what you call overbought and this is what you call overbought and then< then anything that's below the red line then anything that's below the red line at< at the bottom is What's called the at the bottom is What's called the overso< overso condition so what we are really overso condition so what we are really looking< looking out for is the overs so looking out for is the overs so condition< condition as opposed to overboard or condition as opposed to overboard or somewhere< somewhere in the middle so why is that somewhere in the middle so why is that so< so right so if the market is going up so right so if the market is going up and< and then you find it at the overboard and then you find it at the overboard Point< Point yes it may go down but you notice Point yes it may go down but you notice the< the waves down the movement down is much the waves down the movement down is much smaller< smaller than the moves upwards because smaller than the moves upwards because generally< generally this is trending upwards so generally this is trending upwards so that< that is why we want to only find when that is why we want to only find when it's< it's oversold so if you find oversold in it's oversold so if you find oversold in uptrending< uptrending stock like for example down uptrending stock like for example down here< here then there is a higher probability here then there is a higher probability that< that we know that the market can go up that we know that the market can go up compared< compared to it to go down right now of compared to it to go down right now of course< course there's always a chance the course there's always a chance the market< market can continue to go lower you lose market can continue to go lower you lose on< on the trade that is part and parcel of on the trade that is part and parcel of trading< trading right if you have a 70% win rate trading right if you have a 70% win rate strategy< strategy it just means that you have a strategy it just means that you have a 30%< 30% losing rate on the strategy so 30% losing rate on the strategy so expect< expect the losses to come right do not expect the losses to come right do not just< just put on one trade or 10 trade and just put on one trade or 10 trade and say< say that hey Davis I'm still in a loss say that hey Davis I'm still in a loss right< right because there is always a chance right because there is always a chance that< that you could still lose and for the that you could still lose and for the past< past 10 trades overall could still be a past 10 trades overall could still be a loss< loss aim for the next 100 trades okay loss aim for the next 100 trades okay now< now next identify support levels so you now next identify support levels so you can< can see down here I've drawn a line over can see down here I've drawn a line over here< here and this line just basically is a here and this line just. basically is a place< place whereby there were previous place whereby there were previous bounces< bounces of this area right so when you bounces of this area right so when you see< see the price bounc certain areas like see the price bounc certain areas like for< for example here then this is areas for example here then this is areas where< where we can draw a line and we call where we can draw a line and we call this< this support levels because the next this support levels because the next time< time the price comes down then there can time the price comes down then there can at< at least be a better probability that at least be a better probability that the< the price could again bounce back up the price could again bounce back up then< then it to go down now step number four then it to go down now step number four sell< sell the bull putut spread below this sell the bull putut spread below this support< support level right so we know this is a support level right so we know this is a price< price level whereby there's a price level whereby there's a possibility< possibility for the price to bounce up possibility for the price to bounce up so< so that is why we want to put our bull so that is why we want to put our bull put< put spread below it now how far below put spread below it now how far below this< this this really comes down to you again this this really comes down to you again you< you got to adjust this based on your you got to adjust this based on your risk< risk reward ratio and also you know risk reward ratio and also you know based< based on the support levels so you can based on the support levels so you can see< see down here if you see that there's see down here if you see that there's another< another support level below you could another support level below you could choose< choose to place one even further out the choose to place one even further out the money< money now what about the DTE now the DTE money now what about the DTE now the DTE is< is what I would suggest just choose the is what I would suggest just choose the closest< closest to 45 DTE and the reason for closest to 45 DTE and the reason for this< this is because the tasty trade team this is because the tasty trade team have< have already did the study as you can have already did the study as you can see< see down here the table down here the see down here the table down here the study< study was to measure the expected Move study was to measure the expected Move versus< versus the realized move now I've versus the realized move now I've already< already created a whole video just on already created a whole video just on this< this right on the expected Move versus this right on the expected Move versus the< the realized move on my channel it's the realized move on my channel it's called< called the number one secret to becoming called the number one secret to becoming consistently< consistently profitable just go ahead consistently profitable just go ahead and< and watch that video If you haven't but and watch that video If you haven't but for< for this video what you just need to for this video what you just need to know< know is that our Edge comes from the know is that our Edge comes from the fact< fact that the realized move is actually fact that the realized move is actually lesser< lesser than the expected move the lesser than the expected move the expected< expected move is basically what the expected move is basically what the model< model predicts the movement of the model predicts the movement of the underlying< underlying the realized move basically underlying the realized move basically is< is the movement when it actually already is the movement when it actually already happened< happened so our Edge lies in this whole happened so our Edge lies in this whole fact< fact down here however this fact down fact down here however this fact down here< here or rather this Edge can only be here or rather this Edge can only be found< found when you trade the 45 DTE and found when you trade the 45 DTE and above< above right you can see down here above right you can see down here anything< anything that is lesser than 45 DTE you anything that is lesser than 45 DTE you can< can see down here it says expected can see down here it says expected bigger< bigger than realized the answer is no bigger than realized the answer is no that< that means to say the movement is about that means to say the movement is about equal< equal but if you want an edge go for the equal but if you want an edge go for the one< one that's closest to 45 DTE now step one that's closest to 45 DTE now step number< number five the final one is trade number five the final one is trade management< management so how do you manage the management so how do you manage the trade< trade so if the trade is in a profit trade so if the trade is in a profit there< there are two ways to exit either Exit there are two ways to exit either Exit at< at expiration or at 21 DTE and you can at expiration or at 21 DTE and you can actually< actually leave the expiration if you actually leave the expiration if you want< want to because the market did not come want to because the market did not come low< low enough into your bull put spread so low enough into your bull put spread so you< you don't have to worry about being you don't have to worry about being assigned< assigned early that means you could be assigned early that means you could be assigned< assigned on this short put down here and assigned on this short put down here and then< then you're going to get 100 shares then you're going to get 100 shares right< right but you don't have to worry about right but you don't have to worry about this< this if the market has gone up because this if the market has gone up because the< the trade is in a profit so you can the trade is in a profit so you can either< either Exit at expiration or you could either Exit at expiration or you could choose< choose to exit earlier at 21 DTE and choose to exit earlier at 21 DTE and again< again I've already shown you the again I've already shown you the statistics< statistics to show that if you just Exit statistics to show that if you just Exit 21< 21 DTE mechanically you're going to get 21 DTE mechanically you're going to get a< a better return over time now there's a better return over time now there's another< another one which is to just exit at 50% another one which is to just exit at 50% take< take profit now you can do that as well take profit now you can do that as well right< right I mentioned this in quite a number right I mentioned this in quite a number of< of other videos where you can combine 21 of other videos where you can combine 21 DTE< DTE and 50% take profit but for this DTE and 50% take profit but for this video< video I want to keep things very simple video I want to keep things very simple for< for you just to two management style for you just to two management style right< right either expiration or a 21 DTE is right either expiration or a 21 DTE is smaller< smaller enough for you to still be smaller enough for you to still be profitable< profitable over the long term now what profitable over the long term now what if< if your trade is in a loss if your trade if your trade is in a loss if your trade is< is in loss then simply exit if there's is in loss then simply exit if there's less< less than 21 DTE but if there's more less than 21 DTE but if there's more than< than 21 DTE you can just simply hold on than 21 DTE you can just simply hold on to< to trade so for example if the market to trade so for example if the market comes< comes down here below your put spread comes down here below your put spread and< and you notice that there's still 30 DTE and you notice that there's still 30 DTE left< left now in this case all you going to left now in this case all you going to do< do is just hold on to the trade because do is just hold on to the trade because you< you never know before 21 DTE the market you never know before 21 DTE the market might< might just bounce back up again and then might just bounce back up again and then you< you would be in a profit in this case you would be in a profit in this case but< but if it's less than 21 DTE we want to but if it's less than 21 DTE we want to exit< exit because of two things number one we exit because of two things number one we want<

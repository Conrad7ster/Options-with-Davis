### Rolling Covered Call For A Loss - Good or Badï¼Ÿ-ESQvYBXk7uI
==============================================================

Language: en alright< alright alrighty so today's video we're alright alrighty so today's video we're gonna< gonna be talking about rolling a covered gonna be talking about rolling a covered call< call for a loss right is it good or is call for a loss right is it good or is it< it bad is it actually a viable strategy it bad is it actually a viable strategy or< or is it just downright a mistake right or is it just downright a mistake right so< so let's find out so whenever we're so let's find out so whenever we're rolling< rolling a cover call the general rule of rolling a cover call the general rule of thumb< thumb is to always roll your cover call thumb is to always roll your cover call for< for a credit that's because when you for a credit that's because when you roll< roll for credit right you can reduce roll for credit right you can reduce your< your cost basis over time and it also your cost basis over time and it also helps< helps cushion the losses if the stock helps cushion the losses if the stock drops< drops so having a cover call in this drops so having a cover call in this sense< sense when you're rolling for a credit sense when you're rolling for a credit it< it really helps you it really helps you get< get more profits over time get more profits over time but< but there are times when you actually but there are times when you actually can't< can't roll out and up for credit right can't roll out and up for credit right so< so when we are rolling our covered call so when we are rolling our covered call most< most of the time we want to be rolling most of the time we want to be rolling out< out and up because this way we can get out and up because this way we can get some< some credit extrinsic value at the same some credit extrinsic value at the same time< time we make room time we make room for< for the underlying stock to go up right for the underlying stock to go up right in< in to gain some intrinsic value because in to gain some intrinsic value because ultimately< ultimately the driver of a cover call ultimately the driver of a cover call profit< profit is from the gains of the profit is from the gains of the underlying< underlying stock or from your long call underlying stock or from your long call if< if you are doing a per man's cover call if you are doing a per man's cover call so< so there are times when you can't so there are times when you can't actually< actually roll out and up for credit actually roll out and up for credit is< is when your cover call is deep in the is when your cover call is deep in the money< money and when you don't want to roll money and when you don't want to roll too< too far out in time right ideally we too far out in time right ideally we want< want days to expiration 45 for optimal want days to expiration 45 for optimal theta< theta decay so for example let's say theta decay so for example let's say that< that we have sold a covered call that we have sold a covered call somewhere< somewhere around here right so at this somewhere around here right so at this point< point of time the market has gone really point of time the market has gone really high< high uh really when above our cover call high uh really when above our cover call and< and it's pretty much deep in the money and it's pretty much deep in the money so< so ideally what we want to do normally so ideally what we want to do normally is< is to roll up and up in time is to roll up and up in time right< right so we roll to a further expiration right so we roll to a further expiration date< date at the same time we're gonna roll date at the same time we're gonna roll to< to a higher strike price so we gain more to a higher strike price so we gain more on< on this difference down here in the on this difference down here in the underlying< underlying stock right the intrinsic underlying stock right the intrinsic value< value gain down here but the problem is value gain down here but the problem is that< that sometimes when it's too deep in the that sometimes when it's too deep in the money< money you can't actually roll for a money you can't actually roll for a credit< credit so if you were to just if you credit so if you were to just if you want< want to roll for credit you may have to want to roll for credit you may have to roll< roll to a much further expiration date roll to a much further expiration date right< right what happens you know if you sold right what happens you know if you sold a< a 45 days a 45 days cover< cover call down here and within just the cover call down here and within just the next< next five days you know your cover call next five days you know your cover call got< got breached so in this case you may got breached so in this case you may need< need to roll to a much further need to roll to a much further expiration< expiration date maybe to the 60 days of expiration date maybe to the 60 days of 90< 90 days or may have to go even further 90 days or may have to go even further to< to 120 days or more right so when it to 120 days or more right so when it becomes< becomes too far out becomes too far out right< right we don't really have this optimal right we don't really have this optimal theta< theta decay because the speed of the theta decay because the speed of the theta< theta where the extrinsic value really theta where the extrinsic value really starts< starts to decay from 45 days down to starts to decay from 45 days down to zero< zero but if you were to have a zero but if you were to have a option< option that has about 90 to 120 days or option that has about 90 to 120 days or more< more it's going to have much lesser more it's going to have much lesser theta< theta decay so this is where we really theta decay so this is where we really need< need to balance you know the strike need to balance you know the strike price< price at the same time as the days of price at the same time as the days of expiration< expiration left on the covered call expiration left on the covered call so< so this is one of those times where you so this is one of those times where you may< may have to roll for a loss right so you may have to roll for a loss right so you may< may have to brew for a loss and it means may have to brew for a loss and it means that< that you are very bullish on the that you are very bullish on the underlying< underlying stock right if you're very underlying stock right if you're very bullish< bullish on the underlying stock then it bullish on the underlying stock then it does< does make sense to grow for a loss and does make sense to grow for a loss and you< you are also prioritizing intrinsic you are also prioritizing intrinsic value< value gain on the stock or the call value gain on the stock or the call option< option and also at the same time you do option and also at the same time you do not< not want your. covered call to be too far not want your covered call to be too far out< out in time right so i'm gonna go over out in time right so i'm gonna go over to< to the td ameritrade platform to show to the td ameritrade platform to show you< you exactly what i mean okay so we are you exactly what i mean okay so we are in< in my think of swim platform here by td in my think of swim platform here by td ameritrade< ameritrade so uh i want to give you an ameritrade so uh i want to give you an example< example right so let's say for example example right so let's say for example uh< uh on this chart down here let's say for uh on this chart down here let's say for unh< unh let's say you sold a covered call at unh let's say you sold a covered call at around< around the 500 mark and the market right around the 500 mark and the market right now< now has gone all the way to 537 so now has gone all the way to 537 so around< around this point of time all right you around this point of time all right you might< might say you want to roll so if you might say you want to roll so if you want< want to roll want to roll the< the thing is that right you may have the thing is that right you may have only< only maybe you still have 37 days left only maybe you still have 37 days left to< to expiration on this cover call right to expiration on this cover call right you< you may have sold it around 45 days then you may have sold it around 45 days then just< just within seven days the market has just within seven days the market has gone< gone way above your cover call gone way above your cover call right< right so at this point of time you want right so at this point of time you want to< to roll it so here's the dilemma that to roll it so here's the dilemma that you< you may face you may face so< so for example if you want to roll your so for example if you want to roll your cover< cover call most of the time you want to cover call most of the time you want to roll< roll to the next expiration date right roll to the next expiration date right it< it could be for the 44 days so this is it could be for the 44 days so this is normally< normally the optimal time frame which we normally the optimal time frame which we want< want to roll a cover call to because want to roll a cover call to because this< this is where we have optimal theta this is where we have optimal theta decay< decay but there are times when you do decay but there are times when you do this< this you realize that you are not able this you realize that you are not able to< to roll for a credit right so for to roll for a credit right so for example< example if on the row out and up you see example if on the row out and up you see if< if i wrote to five one zero it'll be for if i wrote to five one zero it'll be for a< a debit a debit so< so if it's for a debit you'll be so if it's for a debit you'll be actually< actually giving up seven dollars and actually giving up seven dollars and sixty< sixty eight cents just to get uh maybe sixty eight cents just to get uh maybe about< about two dollars and 32 cents so we may about two dollars and 32 cents so we may want< want to adjust this right so let's say want to adjust this right so let's say if< if we were to go to a further update can if we were to go to a further update can we< we get a credit so this is the kind of we get a credit so this is the kind of uh uh uh decision< decision making process you have to make decision making process you have to make when< when you roll so at this point of time when you roll so at this point of time you< you see you can roll to the 21st october you see you can roll to the 21st october but< but it becomes 72 days to expiration so but it becomes 72 days to expiration so it's< it's quite far out in time but it's quite far out in time but you< you still get a debit you still get a debit but< but at least the debit is not so bad so but at least the debit is not so bad so you'll< you'll be giving up one dollar to get you'll be giving up one dollar to get nine< nine dollars roughly nine dollars in nine dollars roughly nine dollars in intrinsic< intrinsic value gain so that means intrinsic value gain so that means you'll< you'll be rolling to five one zero that you'll be rolling to five one zero that means< means if the market is to stay above means if the market is to stay above five< five one zero at the expiration date it five one zero at the expiration date it means< means that you actually gain an means that you actually gain an additional< additional eight dollar something right additional eight dollar something right almost< almost nine dollars uh in intrinsic almost nine dollars uh in intrinsic value< value gain value gain if< if you had just wanted to roll for a if you had just wanted to roll for a credit< credit right you may have to roll all credit right you may have to roll all the< the way or maybe you may just want to the way or maybe you may just want to stay< stay to 500 right if you wrote this you stay to 500 right if you wrote this you only< only be getting six dollars uh in terms only be getting six dollars uh in terms of< of extrinsic value right so if you roll of extrinsic value right so if you roll for< for a debit for a loss for a debit for a loss and< and the market stays above five one zero and the market stays above five one zero you'll< you'll be getting about eight dollars 85 you'll be getting about eight dollars 85 cents< cents but if you will to roll just to cents but if you will to roll just to the< the same strike price you get six the same strike price you get six dollars< dollars but you lose out on the two dollars but you lose out on the two dollars< dollars in intrinsic value gain so this dollars in intrinsic value gain so this is< is kind of a dilemma that you have to do is kind of a dilemma that you have to do to< to to make right a decision that you to to make right a decision that you have< have to make now what if you rolled it have to make now what if you rolled it to< to even further out to try and get a to even further out to try and get a credit< credit so let's say i roll to the 510 credit so let's say i roll to the 510 and< and i'm going to roll to 16 december now and i'm going to roll to 16 december now if< if you roll to 16 december it's if you roll to 16 december it's definitely< definitely going to give you a credit in definitely going to give you a credit in fact< fact you're going to get 680 fact you're going to get 680 for< for the roll right for the roll right so< so 6. 80 you can roll to so 6.

80 you can roll to zero< zero but the problem is that now we have zero but the problem is that now we have rolled< rolled too far out in time right it's rolled too far out in time right it's 128< 128 days so if you can roll for 128 days 128 days so if you can roll for 128 days what< what happens if unh continues to rally what happens if unh continues to rally from< from here and it goes all the way to 600 from here and it goes all the way to 600 and< and if let's say imagine if it goes to and if let's say imagine if it goes to 600< 600 in let's say 30 days if it goes 600 in let's say 30 days if it goes there< there in 30 days now your option would there in 30 days now your option would have< have roughly 100 days and where you're have roughly 100 days and where you're going< going to roll it to you're going to roll going to roll it to you're going to roll even< even further out in time and it reaches even further out in time and it reaches a< a point where it's going to be few a point where it's going to be few hundred< hundred days up just for a cover call hundred days up just for a cover call which< which it doesn't really make too much which it doesn't really make too much sense< sense then because your money will be sense then because your money will be tied< tied up in this position and you're not tied up in this position and you're not going< going to gain any additional money as going to gain any additional money as well well well so< so uh this is where the the balance you so uh this is where the the balance you have< have to make so maybe this is where you have to make so maybe this is where you might< might want to consider rolling for a might want to consider rolling for a loss< loss so this is where maybe you might loss so this is where maybe you might consider< consider going to 21st october and then consider going to 21st october and then roll< roll to 510 so this way at least it's roll to 510 so this way at least it's not< not too far out in time as you can see not too far out in time as you can see the< the difference between 21st october 16th the difference between 21st october 16th december< december is about 50 days out right 50 december is about 50 days out right 50 something< something days so that's that's pretty something days so that's that's pretty far< far out in time so if you were to roll far out in time so if you were to roll to< to the sixth uh to the 21st october it's to the sixth uh to the 21st october it's at< at least not too bad right it's about 72 at least not too bad right it's about 72 days< days and then you still can get a nine days and then you still can get a nine dollars< dollars in intrinsic value gain about dollars in intrinsic value gain about nine< nine dollars so you'll be rolling this nine dollars so you'll be rolling this to to to five< five one zero five one zero and< and then you stay at 72 days left right and then you stay at 72 days left right 72< 72 days left and hopefully the market 72 days left and hopefully the market you< you know do not rally too far up and it you know do not rally too far up and it could< could maybe hit the resistance points could maybe hit the resistance points before< before coming down and that's when the before coming down and that's when the days< days to expiration left will start to days to expiration left will start to get< get slightly lesser as you get slightly get slightly lesser as you get slightly lesser< lesser that's when your theta decay can lesser that's when your theta decay can start< start to pick up and starts to erode the start to pick up and starts to erode the value< value right capture most of the profit value right capture most of the profit on< on your covered core so this is one of on your covered core so this is one of the< the the kind of the dilemma the the the kind of the dilemma the predicament< predicament you have to face so i'm predicament you have to face so i'm going< going to give you an example of actually going to give you an example of actually what< what i did on this stock on unh where what i did on this stock on unh where not< not too long ago i actually did roll for not too long ago i actually did roll for a< a loss okay so this is a trade uh on the a loss okay so this is a trade uh on the unh< unh united health where i had to roll unh united health where i had to roll for< for a loss for a loss a< a few times and i'm going to share with a few times and i'm going to share with you< you the decision making process i had on you the decision making process i had on why< why i decided to roll my cover call for why i decided to roll my cover call for a< a loss rather for a credit so on this a loss rather for a credit so on this date< date i actually uh did open a position date i actually uh did open a position on< on the for the promise cover call where on the for the promise cover call where i< i long a call somewhere around this i long a call somewhere around this price< price down here price down here uh< uh which. is quite a pretty good uh price uh which is quite a pretty good uh price and< and then i sold a cover call at the 410 and then i sold a cover call at the 410 strike< strike price now just a few days later strike price now just a few days later only< only as you can see just a number of only as you can see just a number of days< days later it breached or rather it days later it breached or rather it touched< touched my covered call at four one zero touched my covered call at four one zero so< so at this point of time i wanted to so at this point of time i wanted to roll< roll because it seems very strong to me roll because it seems very strong to me and< and if you watch my video on the rolling and if you watch my video on the rolling the< the cover call you know that if you do the cover call you know that if you do not< not want your stock to be called away not want your stock to be called away the< the best time for you to roll your cover the best time for you to roll your cover call< call is when the market actually reaches call is when the market actually reaches your< your cover call strike price and since your cover call strike price and since it< it was pretty early it was pretty early on< on in time when i first sold my cover on in time when i first sold my cover call< call right roughly about five to six call right roughly about five to six days< days since i sold the cover call i days since i sold the cover call i wanted< wanted to quickly roll this to a further wanted to quickly roll this to a further outing< outing time as well as roll to a higher outing time as well as roll to a higher strike< strike price before it gets too deep in strike price before it gets too deep in the< the money because i'm still pretty the money because i'm still pretty bullish< bullish on the stock right so bullish on the stock right so on< on this day i decided to roll it out and on this day i decided to roll it out and up< up in time but the problem is that when up in time but the problem is that when i< i roll it out and up in time right i had i roll it out and up in time right i had to< to roll for a debit as you can see down to roll for a debit as you can see down here< here and the reason is because i only here and the reason is because i only rolled< rolled it out about two weeks later i rolled it out about two weeks later i didn't< didn't want the expiration date of the didn't want the expiration date of the cover< cover call to be too far out because at cover call to be too far out because at this< this point in time my cover call when i this point in time my cover call when i first< first sold it is around 45 days right so first sold it is around 45 days right so five< five days has passed it's still around five days has passed it's still around 40< 40 days so if i were to 40 days so if i were to roll< roll it out again for credit it may roll it out again for credit it may extend< extend to maybe 70 days or 80 days and i extend to maybe 70 days or 80 days and i didn't< didn't want to hang on to a cover call didn't want to hang on to a cover call that< that is too far out so at this point of that is too far out so at this point of time< time the decision which i made or rather time the decision which i made or rather the< the thought process which i had was that the thought process which i had was that i< i was hoping that the market would go up i was hoping that the market would go up and< and then uh kind of come back down and then uh kind of come back down within< within this time frame so this way my within this time frame so this way my cover< cover call would expire out of money and cover call would expire out of money and they< they would at least just leave me the they would at least just leave me the long< long leap right so this is because i i long leap right so this is because i i kind< kind of have a very bullish kind of have a very bullish outlook< outlook after this move up down here outlook after this move up down here especially< especially after it had a very especially after it had a very good< good earnings report good earnings report so< so that's my decision down here so so that's my decision down here so when< when i wrote this up right one thing to when i wrote this up right one thing to to< to see to notice is that this is a 10 to see to notice is that this is a 10 points< points move up right so i moved up from points move up right so i moved up from 410< 410 to 420 so what is it that i gave up 410 to 420 so what is it that i gave up so< so i gave up any positive extrinsic so i gave up any positive extrinsic value< value to gain some intrinsic value on my value to gain some intrinsic value on my underlying< underlying long call position right so underlying long call position right so when< when i do this what i'm essentially when i do this what i'm essentially doing< doing is i'm giving up 2. 60 cents to doing is i'm giving up 2.

60 cents to gain< gain 10 gain 10 if< if i give up 2. 60 to gain 10 if i give up 2.

60 to gain 10 well< well my net profit would be well my net profit would be seven< seven dollars and forty cents if the seven dollars and forty cents if the market< market really does go up above four to market really does go up above four to zero< zero so at this point of time this is zero so at this point of time this is pretty< pretty much kind of a little bit of a pretty much kind of a little bit of a balance< balance also a little bit of a risk balance also a little bit of a risk because< because if the market actually because if the market actually doesn't< doesn't go up above four to zero all doesn't go up above four to zero all right< right and then it just goes immediately right and then it just goes immediately from< from this point in time it goes down from this point in time it goes down then< then i would have actually lost uh two then i would have actually lost uh two dollars< dollars and sixty cents just for uh dollars and sixty cents just for uh rolling< rolling this for a loss so what happened rolling this for a loss so what happened next< next as you can see the price really did next as you can see the price really did gap< gap up and from there it just continued gap up and from there it just continued going< going up so this was a very strong going up so this was a very strong momentum< momentum up so on one end i was right on momentum up so on one end i was right on the< the direction that it went above 420 so the direction that it went above 420 so in< in this case i actually gained the 714 in this case i actually gained the 714 intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value right< right because i wrote it up there but it right because i wrote it up there but it went< went way too high above my strike price went way too high above my strike price so< so at this point of time i had made a so at this point of time i had made a decision< decision to make another row because i decision to make another row because i could< could get um could get um exercised< exercised if right the market continues exercised if right the market continues to< to go up in time and never comes back to go up in time and never comes back down< down at the same time i didn't want to down at the same time i didn't want to just< just lock my profit to just this small just lock my profit to just this small little< little portion down here right the little portion down here right the profit< profit is being locked because of my profit is being locked because of my cover< cover call and my entry price is cover call and my entry price is somewhere< somewhere around here so the next thing somewhere around here so the next thing i< i need to do is to decide on the row at i need to do is to decide on the row at this< this point i decided to do a row from this point i decided to do a row from 420< 420 to 440 so you can see 420 to 440 so you can see there< there is a 20 points roll but then i there is a 20 points roll but then i took< took a loss of roughly 15 took a loss of roughly 15 in< in debit right so why did i do this so in debit right so why did i do this so the< the reason i did this is. because i the reason i did this is because i couldn't< couldn't find any other strikes or couldn't find any other strikes or rather< rather i couldn't get a strike rather i couldn't get a strike that< that i wanted right i wanted to go from that i wanted right i wanted to go from 420< 420 to 440 420 to 440 for< for a credit right because it has for a credit right because it has already< already gone too deep in the money and already gone too deep in the money and while< while i could go even further right you while i could go even further right you notice< notice that i actually wrote from notice that i actually wrote from november< november to december which is about november to december which is about another< another one month out the thing is that another one month out the thing is that i< i didn't want to go to january or i didn't want to go to january or february< february or even to march right i didn't february or even to march right i didn't want< want it to go too far out in time so want it to go too far out in time so this< this is where i thought that you know if this is where i thought that you know if i< i were to roll to the 440 point i were to roll to the 440 point and< and if the market was to continue going and if the market was to continue going up< up right again i'm still very bullish up right again i'm still very bullish because< because again after this uh uh positive because again after this uh uh positive earnings< earnings right i felt that if the market earnings right i felt that if the market continued< continued to go up was to continue to go continued to go up was to continue to go out< out i would be able to gain the five out i would be able to gain the five dollars< dollars in intrinsic value and i give up dollars in intrinsic value and i give up fourteen< fourteen dollars right down here so i fourteen dollars right down here so i give< give up fourteen dollars to get twenty give up fourteen dollars to get twenty dollars< dollars i will get an additional five dollars i will get an additional five dollars< dollars so dollars so at< at the end you can see that uh unh at the end you can see that uh unh really< really did continue to go up all the way really did continue to go up all the way right< right it ended up even higher later on right it ended up even higher later on but< but after this time i managed to grow a but after this time i managed to grow a few< few times after market came down i few times after market came down i rolled< rolled it up a few more times i think rolled it up a few more times i think eventually< eventually i rolled it to about 470 eventually i rolled it to about 470 right< right and the remaining rows i did it right and the remaining rows i did it for< for credit because i already did too for credit because i already did too many< many debit rolls which i didn't want to many debit rolls which i didn't want to erode< erode anymore into my profits so i erode anymore into my profits so i decided< decided to do a credit roll later on as decided to do a credit roll later on as you< you can see if i do the credit rule i you can see if i do the credit rule i only< only could limit myself to 470. if i had only could limit myself to 470.

if i had done< done a debit roll done a debit roll right< right i could have probably gotten even right i could have probably gotten even further< further maybe to 490 but then again the further maybe to 490 but then again the market< market has already gone pretty high up market has already gone pretty high up at< at this point so around 470 i kind of at this point so around 470 i kind of felt< felt that maybe the market may be a felt that maybe the market may be a little< little bit overbought right over little bit overbought right over exhausted< exhausted to the top it may start to exhausted to the top it may start to make< make its move down make its move down so< so i decided to get out of so i decided to get out of the< the whole position as a whole right in the whole position as a whole right in the< the end it did go up so uh well at the the end it did go up so uh well at the end< end i still did get out for a pretty end i still did get out for a pretty decent< decent profit so i'm fine with that decent profit so i'm fine with that but< but here's the thing to take note right but here's the thing to take note right if< if i hadn't rolled for a debit at this if i hadn't rolled for a debit at this point< point in time right or if i had rolled point in time right or if i had rolled out< out for a cover call out for a cover call very< very far out in time for a credit the very far out in time for a credit the problem< problem is that it will be very hard for problem is that it will be very hard for me< me to roll this cover call later on me to roll this cover call later on because< because if i'm too far out in time it'll because if i'm too far out in time it'll be< be harder for me to want to roll from be harder for me to want to roll from 180< 180 days position to a 240 days position 180 days position to a 240 days position if< if you understand what i mean right so i if you understand what i mean right so i wanted< wanted to kind of balance the number of wanted to kind of balance the number of days< days to expiration left as well as the days to expiration left as well as the strike< strike price which i want to roll to so strike price which i want to roll to so. in< in hindsight this was actually i thought in hindsight this was actually i thought it< it was actually a pretty decent row it was actually a pretty decent row because< because although i gave up you know any because although i gave up you know any credit< credit for rolling on the cover call i credit for rolling on the cover call i managed< managed to gain the intrinsic value managed to gain the intrinsic value difference< difference right by rolling to the difference right by rolling to the strike< strike price which i wanted right so i strike price which i wanted right so i rolled< rolled for 20 points i gave up 15 i rolled for 20 points i gave up 15 i gained< gained a net five dollars at the end of gained a net five dollars at the end of the< the day right because the market still the day right because the market still continued< continued to go above my strike price continued to go above my strike price all< all right guys so whether should you all right guys so whether should you roll< roll a cred a cover call for a loss roll a cred a cover call for a loss ultimately< ultimately this is a decision that you ultimately this is a decision that you have< have to make but if you feel you're very have to make but if you feel you're very you< you know bullish on the underlying stock you know bullish on the underlying stock then< then it doesn't really hurt to roll for then it doesn't really hurt to roll for a< a loss if your view is right and if you a loss if your view is right and if you can< can roll for a small debit that will be can roll for a small debit that will be good< good as well by the end of the day you good as well by the end of the day you really< really have to manage right you have to really have to manage right you have to balance< balance the strike price as well as the balance the strike price as well as the days< days to expiration left on your covered days to expiration left on your covered call call call alright< alright guys so i hope this video has alright guys so i hope this video has been< been helpful for you and it has i will been helpful for you and it has i will greatly< greatly appreciate if you would greatly appreciate if you would subscribe< subscribe and also give me a thumbs up subscribe and also give me a thumbs up and< and as always i appreciate your time for and as always i appreciate your time for watching<

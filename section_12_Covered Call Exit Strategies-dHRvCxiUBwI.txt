### Covered Call Exit Strategies-dHRvCxiUBwI
============================================

Language: en all< all right all righty all right all righty so< so i've already created a number of so i've already created a number of cover< cover call videos and you can go and cover call videos and you can go and check< check them out but they're mostly on check them out but they're mostly on entries< entries and as well as rolling cover entries and as well as rolling cover calls< calls and i haven't really covered one calls and i haven't really covered one on< on exit strategy so i've got a number of on exit strategy so i've got a number of people< people who are requesting you know to people who are requesting you know to create< create a video on how to exit their create a video on how to exit their covered< covered calls how to close them so i'm covered calls how to close them so i'm going< going to share with you a few exit going to share with you a few exit strategies< strategies in this video so you can use strategies in this video so you can use them< them for yourself as well them for yourself as well so< so the very first exit strategy is what so the very first exit strategy is what i< i call till expiration do us part so i call till expiration do us part so this< this is a part of marriage where you this is a part of marriage where you know< know they have the vow where it's till know they have the vow where it's till death< death do us part so basically you just death do us part so basically you just keep< keep on to your cover call until it keep on to your cover call until it expires< expires worthless so there are two ways expires worthless so there are two ways to< to do it right so the first way is if to do it right so the first way is if you're< you're willing to get a sign right you you're willing to get a sign right you can< can just simply wait until the cover can just simply wait until the cover call< call get assigned or expires worthless call get assigned or expires worthless so< so what this does is they actually gives so what this does is they actually gives a< a chance for your cover call to get out a chance for your cover call to get out of< of the money if it's in the money so for of the money if it's in the money so for example< example if the stock you know example if the stock you know as< as it goes up uh to this point you as it goes up uh to this point you decided< decided to sell a covered call decided to sell a covered call so< so if it goes up and then you do not so if it goes up and then you do not roll< roll it sometimes there's a chance that roll it sometimes there's a chance that it< it could go up and then go back down and it could go up and then go back down and it< it closes all of the money this way your it closes all of the money this way your cover< cover card expires and then you can go cover card expires and then you can go ahead< ahead and sell another cover call so ahead and sell another cover call so this< this is the first way the second way is this is the first way the second way is that< that you can just keep rolling until that you can just keep rolling until your< your cover call finally expires so for your cover call finally expires so for example< example if you example if you let's< let's say sell a covered call at this let's say sell a covered call at this point point point so< so at this point you have a cover call so at this point you have a cover call and< and the the stock continues to move up and the the stock continues to move up past< past this point so at this point maybe past this point so at this point maybe you< you say that you want to roll up your you say that you want to roll up your covered< covered call so you could roll up to covered call so you could roll up to this< this point this point and< and then if the market goes up again and then if the market goes up again right< right let's say it goes up right let's say it goes up right< right you can roll it again depending on right you can roll it again depending on how< how far you can get a roll maybe this how far you can get a roll maybe this time< time when you roll it's still slightly time when you roll it's still slightly in< in the money okay in the money okay and< and then you just wait for it right so and then you just wait for it right so maybe< maybe there's a chance if you cannot maybe there's a chance if you cannot roll< roll for any more credit you could just roll for any more credit you could just wait< wait and see if the market maybe wait and see if the market maybe eventually< eventually goes down and your cover call eventually goes down and your cover call expires< expires worthless all right so very expires worthless all right so very simple< simple for this so the next one is to simple for this so the next one is to set< set a fixed percentage to take profit set a fixed percentage to take profit all< all right so this is the most uh all right so this is the most uh hands-off< hands-off approach very simple the hands-off approach very simple the moment< moment when you sell your cover call you moment when you sell your cover call you can< can immediately place a can immediately place a limit< limit order to place your take profit limit order to place your take profit for< for it right so can be 50 80 or 90 this for it right so can be 50 80 or 90 this is< is the most common numbers right so if is the most common numbers right so if you< you want to just quickly take profit on you want to just quickly take profit on it< it you can just go for 50 because a lot it you can just go for 50 because a lot of< of the time of the time let's< let's say if you sell a let's say if you sell a 30< 30 days cover call right a lot of time 30 days cover call right a lot of time if< if the market moves if the market moves away< away from the cover call let's say the away from the cover call let's say the market< market goes down you notice that you can market goes down you notice that you can easily< easily achieve this 50 easily achieve this. 50 in< in just maybe even the first week after in just maybe even the first week after selling< selling this cover call so you can just selling this cover call so you can just close< close it out close it out automatically< automatically right some people like to automatically right some people like to wait< wait until uh you know most of the wait until uh you know most of the premium< premium has been taken out maybe about premium has been taken out maybe about 80< 80 or 90 so there's very little 80 or 90 so there's very little management< management needed and you can set a tick management needed and you can set a tick profit< profit order after placing the cover profit order after placing the cover call< call all right so this exit strategy call all right so this exit strategy number< number two number two now< now exit strategy number three is to now exit strategy number three is to take< take a loss for capital gains right so take a loss for capital gains right so basically< basically what it means is to take a basically what it means is to take a loss< loss on your covered call in exchange loss on your covered call in exchange for< for potential capital gains on the for potential capital gains on the underlying< underlying stock so underlying stock so i< i give you an example let's say for i give you an example let's say for example example example the< the stock is here and then your cover the stock is here and then your cover call< call is already in the money right you call is already in the money right you already< already got a cover call in the money already got a cover call in the money and< and let's say it's at the strike of 100 and let's say it's at the strike of 100 now now now at< at this point of time at this point of time you< you want to roll to the next level you want to roll to the next level let's< let's say the next available let's say the next available level< level that you want to roll is 110 but level that you want to roll is 110 but you< you notice that if you want to roll it you notice that if you want to roll it will< will be for a debit which means to say will be for a debit which means to say that< that you will have to pay to roll which that you will have to pay to roll which is< is normally not the the ideal scenario is normally not the the ideal scenario which< which we want because whenever we want which we want because whenever we want to< to roll our cover calls we always want to roll our cover calls we always want to< to roll for credit but there will be to roll for credit but there will be times< times when you notice that you can't times when you notice that you can't exactly< exactly roll for a credit unless you exactly roll for a credit unless you really< really roll all the way very far out in really roll all the way very far out in time< time maybe to six months later but time maybe to six months later but that's< that's not really ideal for a cover call that's not really ideal for a cover call right< right ideally for the cover call we want right ideally for the cover call we want to< to have it around the 45 days mark so to have it around the 45 days mark so let's< let's say at this point of time let's say at this point of time the< the stock is already in the money for the stock is already in the money for your< your first cover call and you want to your first cover call and you want to roll< roll through the 110 you notice that roll through the 110 you notice that maybe< maybe you may have to pay a debit so for maybe you may have to pay a debit so for example< example maybe this time you may have to example maybe this time you may have to pay< pay a five dollar debit right so if you pay a five dollar debit right so if you have< have to pay a five dollar debit uh have to pay a five dollar debit uh what< what do you gain right so there's the what do you gain right so there's the gain< gain of ten dollars in terms of gain of ten dollars in terms of intrinsic< intrinsic value on your underlying stock intrinsic value on your underlying stock so< so what this means is that you are so what this means is that you are giving< giving up five dollars right you're giving up five dollars right you're paying< paying out five dollars but you can gain paying out five dollars but you can gain ten< ten dollars that means your net would be ten dollars that means your net would be a< a positive five dollars a positive five dollars if< if the market actually goes up above if the market actually goes up above this< this strike price one one zero this strike price one one zero at< at expiration date so this way you'll be at expiration date so this way you'll be able< able to earn the additional five dollars able to earn the additional five dollars uh< uh on intrinsic value right so i'm going uh on intrinsic value right so i'm going to< to give you an example on one of the to give you an example on one of the trades< trades which i did trades which i did so< so this was a poor man's cover call so this was a poor man's cover call which< which i did which i did on< on the unh united health group on the unh united health group so< so basically on this date so basically on this date i< i enter into a poor man's cover call i enter into a poor man's cover call right< right this is on the first of october right this is on the first of october you< you can see the date down here you can see the date down here right< right so i bought a proven cover call i right so i bought a proven cover call i got< got a pretty good entry i must say so got a pretty good entry i must say so this< this is the leaps i bought a deep in the this is the leaps i bought a deep in the money< money call and you can see that the money call and you can see that the break-even< break-even price for this is simply you break-even price for this is simply you take< take the strike price which is 200 plus take the strike price which is 200 plus what< what i paid for it the debit is 187 so what i paid for it the debit is 187 so the< the the break-even price is 387. 72 the the break-even price is 387.

72 all< all right so it's around three eight all right so it's around three eight eight< eight right close to 390 as you can see eight right close to 390 as you can see this< this is at this point in time when the this is at this point in time when the market< market retraced at the same time i saw a market retraced at the same time i saw a covered< covered call at the 410 strike price covered call at the 410 strike price so< so this is my so this is my cover< cover call on the lips so this becomes a cover call on the lips so this becomes a poor< poor man covered call all right let's poor man covered call all right let's see< see what happened next so on the 11th of see what happened next so on the 11th of uh uh uh october october october as< as you can see the market went to my as you can see the market went to my strike< strike price of 410 so at this point of strike price of 410 so at this point of time< time i decided to roll it up but i time i decided to roll it up but i noticed< noticed that when i want to roll it i i noticed that when i want to roll it i i decided< decided to roll two weeks out so when i decided to roll two weeks out so when i roll< roll two weeks out the next available roll two weeks out the next available. strike< strike is 10 points away now to roll at strike is 10 points away now to roll at 10< 10 points away i couldn't get a credit 10 points away i couldn't get a credit right< right if i wanted the credit right if i wanted the credit i< i have to roll further out but i didn't i have to roll further out but i didn't want< want to roll that far out because at a want to roll that far out because at a point< point in time when i entered into my point in time when i entered into my promise< promise cover call only about nine days promise cover call only about nine days have< have passed 10 days have passed so if i have passed 10 days have passed so if i were< were to roll to a further expiration were to roll to a further expiration date< date i felt it would be a little bit too date i felt it would be a little bit too far< far at the point of time so i didn't far at the point of time so i didn't want< want that so i wanted to roll to to the want that so i wanted to roll to to the next< next available expiration date which is next available expiration date which is just< just two weeks away just two weeks away so< so in this case uh the best i could get so in this case uh the best i could get was< was a debit for it so i have to pay 2. 60 was a debit for it so i have to pay 2.

60 so< so i have to weigh my odds you know so so i have to weigh my odds you know so i'm< i'm. gonna give up two dollars of 60 i'm gonna give up two dollars of 60 cents< cents right i'm going to pay out 2. 60 cents right i'm going to pay out 2.

60 cents< cents but i do have a potential gain of cents but i do have a potential gain of 10< 10 points right because i wrote from 10 points right because i wrote from four< four one zero to four to zero so at this four one zero to four to zero so at this point< point of time it comes down to whether i point of time it comes down to whether i feel< feel that the market still has potential feel that the market still has potential to< to really go up so for me i felt that to really go up so for me i felt that yes< yes i think unh will continue to go up yes i think unh will continue to go up based< based on what i saw on the technicals so based on what i saw on the technicals so i< i decided to do this role for a debit i decided to do this role for a debit again< again i do not recommend it if you do again i do not recommend it if you do not< not know whether the underlying will go not know whether the underlying will go up< up if you're not confident about it but up if you're not confident about it but in< in this case in this case i< i felt pretty confident that it was i felt pretty confident that it was. going< going to go up so instead i decided to going to go up so instead i decided to just< just roll for a debit so this way i just roll for a debit so this way i gained< gained a potential gained a potential seven< seven dollars and forty cents so i make seven dollars and forty cents so i make seven< seven dollars and forty cents in seven dollars and forty cents in intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value on< on the uh poor man's cover call on the on the uh poor man's cover call on the lips< lips rather on the long call leaps if lips rather on the long call leaps if the< the market does go up above this 420 the market does go up above this 420 strike< strike price so i'm giving up 260 but strike price so i'm giving up 260 but i'm< i'm going to gain 740 in terms of i'm going to gain 740 in terms of intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value all< all right so what happened next on the all right so what happened next on the uh< uh november the 1st of november true uh november the 1st of november true enough< enough the market went above my cover enough the market went above my cover call< call at the point of time which was at 4 call at the point of time which was at 4 20. < 20.

so 420 was at this point down here 20. so 420 was at this point down here so< so you can see that the market really so you can see. that the market really blew< blew past this strike price blew past this strike price all< all the way to around 460.

so at this all the way to around 460. so at this point< point of time i decided to make another point of time i decided to make another big< big roll so this is a big roll from 420 big roll so this is a big roll from 420 to< to 440 so this is a 20 points roll from to 440 so this is a 20 points roll from here< here to here and this time again it's here to here and this time again it's for< for a debit for a debit so< so again i have to ask myself at this so again i have to ask myself at this point< point in time right do i feel the market point in time right do i feel the market is< is going to go up so a lot of times if is going to go up so a lot of times if you< you feel it's not going to go up you you feel it's not going to go up you don't< don't want to do this role but i just don't want to do this role but i just felt< felt that it was going to go up right felt that it was going to go up right it< it i had a look at the chart and i just it i had a look at the chart and i just had< had felt a strong feeling that it was had felt a strong feeling that it was going< going to go up in the in the long term going to go up in the in the long term may< may not be in the intermediate term but may not be in the intermediate term but could< could be in the long term it could go up could be in the long term it could go up so< so that is why i wanted to roll this up so that is why i wanted to roll this up to< to. give me more room for the to give me more room for the leaps< leaps to make money so in this case what leaps to make money so in this case what am< am i giving up i'm giving up about 15 am i giving up i'm giving up about 15 but< but i'm gonna gain roughly five dollars but i'm gonna gain roughly five dollars right< right in intrinsic value so is this a right in intrinsic value so is this a worthy< worthy trade this is only a worthy trade worthy trade this is only a worthy trade if< if you feel that the market is going to if you feel that the market is going to go< go above your strike price and in this go above your strike price and in this case< case you can see the market has really case you can see the market has really gone< gone well past the strike price so gone well past the strike price so anyway< anyway even though if it drops somewhere anyway even though if it drops somewhere around< around here it's still above this strike around here it's still above this strike price< price which means i would have captured price which means i would have captured this< this five dollars in the this five dollars in the intrinsic< intrinsic value gain on the leaps intrinsic value gain on the leaps because< because if i just wrote to the same because if i just wrote to the same level< level 420 i may just get a little bit level 420 i may just get a little bit more< more credit but i would miss out on this more credit but i would miss out on this additional< additional intrinsic value gain so additional intrinsic value gain so that's< that's what i decided to do so i rolled that's what i decided to do so i rolled it< it up to 440.

so let's see what happened it up to 440. so let's see what happened next< next the market in the end did come down next the market. in the end did come down it< it retraced back it retraced back down< down to around 440.

so at this point of down to around 440. so at this point of time< time i felt all right it's a good time time i felt all right it's a good time for< for me to roll again because if you for me to roll again because if you watch< watch my video on the rolling watch my video on the rolling then< then you would know that when the market then you would know that when the market is< is right at your strike price is right at your strike price have< have a cover call it has the highest have a cover call it has the highest extrinsic< extrinsic value so that's when you have extrinsic value so that's when you have the< the highest extrinsic value transfer to the highest extrinsic value transfer to the< the following expiration date so this is the following expiration date so this is where< where i decided to roll this time to 450 where i decided to roll this time to 450 and< and you can see this time is for credit and you can see this time is for credit so< so it's no longer for a debit so it's no longer for a debit so< so i did this again so this time the so i did this again so this time the market< market blew past again so this time i market blew past again so this time i decided< decided to roll again but this time i decided to roll again but this time i decided< decided to roll to a much further date decided to roll to a much further date because< because uh it became a little bit too because uh it became a little bit too deep< deep in the money already at this point deep in the money already at this point and< and i didn't want to roll for another and i didn't want to roll for another debit< debit because i really wrote for quite a debit because i really wrote for quite a number< number of debits so this time i decided number of debits so this time i decided to< to just roll up another 20 points and to just roll up another 20 points and wrote< wrote to as far of a date i can to get a wrote to as far of a date i can to get a credit< credit for this 470 role so later on i credit for this 470 role so later on i started< started to roll again another five started to roll again another five points< points and then somewhere towards the points and then somewhere towards the end< end down here this is where i decided to end down here this is where i decided to close< close out this whole position and i was close out this whole position and i was able< able to make a pretty nice gain on this able to make a pretty nice gain on this so< so if i hadn't rolled up in the first so if i hadn't rolled up in the first place< place from this point place from this point to< to this point i'll probably have my to this point i'll probably have my covered< covered call stuck somewhere around here covered call stuck somewhere around here if< if i wanted the same expiration date but if i wanted the same expiration date but because< because i wrote twice to take a loss on because i wrote twice to take a loss on the< the cover call but then overall i still the cover call but then overall i still have< have an intrinsic value gain on the lips have an intrinsic value gain on the lips it< it kind of worked out right it worked it kind of worked out right it worked out< out well in the end so this is one out well in the end so this is one option< option that you can take if you feel option that you can take if you feel strongly< strongly about the underlying stock that strongly about the underlying stock that is< is going to go up so one thing to take is going to go up so one thing to take note< note of is because i have a very long note of is because i have a very long term< term core lips all right this core leaps term core lips all right this core leaps is< is over a year in expiration date so is over a year in expiration date so i< i was willing to uh go for a loss for my i was willing to uh go for a loss for my covered< covered call because i know that in the covered call because i know that in the long< long term i feel that the unh will go up long term i feel that the unh will go up all< all right so that's it for exit strategy all right so that's it for exit strategy number< number three now the last exit strategy number three now the last exit strategy is< is based on profit per day so basically is based on profit per day so basically the< the idea is to close your cover call the idea is to close your cover call when< when the profit exceed the daily average when the profit exceed the daily average profit< profit okay so let me just give an profit okay so let me just give an example< example so let's say for example you example so let's say for example you sold< sold a covered call for three dollars sold a covered call for three dollars with< with uh days to expiration of 30 all with uh days to expiration of 30 all right< right so in 30 days this covered call right so in 30 days this covered call will< will expire so what is your average will expire so what is your average profit< profit per day so you simply just take profit per day so you simply just take the< the profit the profit or< or rather the premium you divided by the or rather the premium you divided by the number< number of days expiration so you know number of days expiration so you know that< that ten dollars is your average profit that ten dollars is your average profit per< per day so on the rough gauge what i per day so on the rough gauge what i want< want to see is that i make uh 10 want to see is that i make uh 10 every< every day all right in terms of profit every day all right in terms of profit right< right on average so if this profit right on average so if this profit actually< actually goes past the 10 mark then i actually goes past the 10 mark then i know< know that am i actually making more than know that am i actually making more than the< the average profit that i would make so the average profit that i would make so in< in this point of time if i make more in this point of time if i make more than< than the average profit i would decide than the average profit i would decide to< to close so for example this is the to close so for example this is the cumulative< cumulative profit this is the days to cumulative profit this is the days to expiration< expiration on your option okay so for expiration on your option okay so for example< example on the very first day you example on the very first day you initiate< initiate it you see that it's three initiate it you see that it's three dollars dollars dollars right< right you sold it for three dollars right you sold it for three dollars and< and then uh yes 30 days to expiration and then uh yes 30 days to expiration all< all right so this is on the day you sold all right so this is on the day you sold the< the covered call now five days later the covered call now five days later right< right five days later your cumulative right five days later your cumulative profit< profit should be fifty dollars so let's profit should be fifty dollars so let's say< say for example say for example you< you take a look at your option and you you take a look at your option and you notice< notice your option is worth two dollars notice your option is worth two dollars seventy< seventy cents so you sold it for three seventy cents so you sold it for three dollars< dollars and then you look at the value dollars and then you look at the value now< now it's only two dollars seventy cents now it's only two dollars seventy cents so< so what does it mean it means that after so what does it mean it means that after five< five days you only made how much five days you only made how much thirty< thirty dollars thirty dollars in< in profit in profit right< right but then based on the average right but then based on the average daily< daily profit you should be making 50 so daily profit you should be making 50 so in< in a sense your covered call is falling in a sense your covered call is falling behind< behind in terms of the profit so at this behind in terms of the profit so at this point< point of time you don't bother to close point of time you don't bother to close it< it right you can just hold on to it it right you can just hold on to it. so< so now another five days has passed so so now another five days has passed so total< total 10 days has passed so 10 days has total 10 days has passed so 10 days has passed< passed your cumulative profit should be passed your cumulative profit should be a< a hundred dollars right so it should be a hundred dollars right so it should be by< by now decade from three dollars to two by now decade from three dollars to two dollars< dollars right but let's say if you take dollars right but let's say if you take a< a look at it and it says two dollars a look at it and it says two dollars twenty< twenty cents so what does it mean twenty cents so what does it mean it< it means that you only made how much it means that you only made how much eighty< eighty dollars eighty dollars on< on your on your uh< uh call because you sold it at three uh call because you sold it at three dollars< dollars and if you were to close the dollars and if you were to close the position< position right now it will be two position right now it will be two dollars< dollars 20 cents only so your profit is dollars 20 cents only so your profit is only< only 80 only 80 so< so you're behind in terms of profit so i so you're behind in terms of profit so i wouldn't< wouldn't close my cover call because of wouldn't close my cover call because of this< this now let's say 15 days have passed this now let's say 15 days have passed since< since you sold it so you should be since you sold it so you should be making< making 150 making 150 now< now this time let's say the market now this time let's say the market really< really dropped right the market is sold really dropped right the market is sold off< off and then you take a look at your off and then you take a look at your covered< covered call now and you see that your covered call now and you see that your cover< cover call instead of uh cover call instead of uh three< three dollars it's now only worth one three dollars it's now only worth one dollar< dollar you sold at three dollar dollar you sold at three dollar now< now if you were to close it you would now if you were to close it you would make< make uh if you close it it would be one make uh if you close it it would be one dollar< dollar so what is your profit if you dollar so what is your profit if you close< close now so the profit is 200 close now so the profit is 200 so< so look at this so look at this right< right now if you close it you will make right now if you close it you will make 200< 200 if you take a look at the daily 200 if you take a look at the daily average< average profit based on 15 days later average profit based on 15 days later you< you should be making only about 150 so you should be making only about 150 so that< that means now you have made more than that means now you have made more than what< what you should be making on the average what you should be making on the average daily< daily profit so this is where you can daily profit so this is where you can decide< decide to say oh i've already made about decide to say oh i've already made about a< a 200 a 200 out< out of 300 premium in just half of the out of 300 premium in just half of the time< time in just 15 days what this means is time in just 15 days what this means is that< that if i wait another 15 days right all that if i wait another 15 days right all the< the way to dte 0 if i wait another 15 the way to dte 0 if i wait another 15 days< days all i can make is only an days all i can make is only an additional< additional one dollar right so you want additional one dollar right so you want to< to ask yourself do i want to take the to ask yourself do i want to take the risk risk risk right< right when i've already made right when i've already made two< two thirds of it in just half the time two thirds of it in just half the time and< and then i have to wait another half the and then i have to wait another half the time< time another 15

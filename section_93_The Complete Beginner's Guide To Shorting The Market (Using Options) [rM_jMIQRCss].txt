======================================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about when to we're going to be talking about when to short< short the market because as we know the short the market because as we know the market< market goes up the market goes down so market goes up the market goes down so when< when there's the opportunity for us to when there's the opportunity for us to short< short the market we want to know exactly short the market we want to know exactly when< when to do so and what kind of when to do so and what kind of strategies< strategies we want to employ when we strategies we want to employ when we want< want to go short the market right so if want to go short the market right so if you< you were to take a look at the market you were to take a look at the market right< right let's just take a look at this right let's just take a look at this chart< chart you want to ask yourself you know chart you want to ask yourself you know where< where are you going to short the market where are you going to short the market right< right if it was you right now in right if it was you right now in hindsight< hindsight of course it's going to be so hindsight of course it's going to be so easy< easy for us to say all right this is easy for us to say all right this is where< where you want to go short all right where you want to go short all right this< this is where we want to go short and this is where we want to go short and our< our place you want to go short another our place you want to go short another place< place we want to go short down here and place we want to go short down here and all< all these times you will definitely make all these times you will definitely make money< money because you already know the money because you already know the market< market is going down but what if you are market is going down but what if you are faced< faced with the current market condition faced with the current market condition right< right now let's say for example this is right now let's say for example this is where< where the market is right now are you where the market is right now are you going< going to short the market and if so what going to short the market and if so what kind< kind of strategies will use right what kind of strategies will use right what kind< kind of option strategies will you use kind of option strategies will you use so< so the question now becomes is when is so the question now becomes is when is the< the best time to go short right so first the best time to go short right so first of< of all what you need to understand is of all what you need to understand is that< that for the market in the long term the that for the market in the long term the market< market generally wants to go up right so market generally wants to go up right so that< that is why the index ETFs the that is why the index ETFs the broad-based< broad-based market you can see the broad-based market you can see the prices< prices are getting higher and higher prices are getting higher and higher over< over time right so that is what you call over time right so that is what you call the< the positive drift the market wants to the positive drift the market wants to go< go up but in the short term the market go up but in the short term the market is< is actually pretty random right you have is actually pretty random right you have what< what you call the random walk Theory so what you call the random walk Theory so in< in the short term there's actually a 50 in the short term there's actually a 50 chance< chance of the market going up or down in chance of the market going up or down in the< the short term and there's no one that the short term and there's no one that can< can really predict where the market will can really predict where the market will go< go in the next what one month three go in the next what one month three months< months six months right in the long term months six months right in the long term in< in the next 10 20 years we know it's in the next 10 20 years we know it's going< going to go up but if we're going to do going to go up but if we're going to do trading< trading we don't want to trade for the trading we don't want to trade for the next< next 10 years right I mean we have our next 10 years right I mean we have our Investment< Investment Portfolio but what if the Investment Portfolio but what if the market< market presents itself an opportunity market presents itself an opportunity for< for us to go short we need to be able to for us to go short we need to be able to identify< identify it identify it so< so the question is how do we identify so the question is how do we identify the< the short-term uh short opportunities the short-term uh short opportunities and< and how do you want to put this art in and how do you want to put this art in our< our favor right how do we increase the our favor right how do we increase the chances< chances that when we take a short trade chances that when we take a short trade the< the market will actually go down the market will actually go down so< so there are two conditions to look out so there are two conditions to look out for< for right so the very first condition is for right so the very first condition is when< when the market is overbought right so when the market is overbought right so for< for this you use what you call uh for this you use what you call uh oscillators< oscillators right indicator oscillators oscillators right indicator oscillators such< such as the RSI and the stochastic such as the RSI and the stochastic oscillator< oscillator so basically these are oscillator so basically these are indicators< indicators that just tell us uh the indicators that just tell us uh the current< current market condition right so current market condition right so basically< basically there is the overbought basically there is the overbought condition< condition and there is the oversold condition and there is the oversold condition< condition when it's below the line down condition when it's below the line down here< here now of course first of all what you here now of course first of all what you don't< don't understand is that these don't understand is that these indicators< indicators are just indication it's not indicators are just indication it's not telling< telling you that it's guaranteed that if telling you that it's guaranteed that if the< the market is overbought the market is the market is overbought the market is going< going to go down or if it's over so it's going to go down or if it's over so it's going< going to go up we're all playing with going to go up we're all playing with probability< probability here right so there's always probability here right so there's always still< still a chance where by the market when still a chance where by the market when it's< it's overbought it can continue to be it's overbought it can continue to be overbought< overbought and the market continues to overbought and the market continues to go< go up or when it's oversold the market go up or when it's oversold the market can< can still continue to be even more can still continue to be even more oversold< oversold and go down so again it's all oversold and go down so again it's all probability< probability and we want to just increase probability and we want to just increase it< it slightly above 50 so that we have the it slightly above 50 so that we have the edge< edge so that in the long term we're edge so that in the long term we're going< going to have a positive expectancy so going to have a positive expectancy so the< the first condition that I like to look the first condition that I like to look out< out for is when the market is overbought out for is when the market is overbought right< right the second condition is to wait right the second condition is to wait until< until the market is near a resistance until the market is near a resistance area< area so a resistance area is basically area so a resistance area is basically the< the place where you see that the price the place where you see that the price have< have some struggles going above right so have some struggles going above right so you< you can see that there are a few times you can see that there are a few times where< where the market have you know just kind where the market have you know just kind of< of bounced off this kind of a ceiling of bounced off this kind of a ceiling and< and then it went back down so this and then it went back down so this indicates< indicates to us you know that there is indicates to us you know that there is some< some kind of a Force down there are some kind of a Force down there are selling< selling pressure right that whenever the selling pressure right that whenever the price< price gets to that point price gets to that point there's< there's a lot of sell orders that makes there's a lot of sell orders that makes the< the market wants to go down so these are the market wants to go down so these are indications< indications where you know there are indications where you know there are resistance< resistance areas so it's basically just resistance areas so it's basically just previous< previous high so again as you can see previous high so again as you can see down< down here what basically I do is you down here what basically I do is you just< just draw one line across and then the just draw one line across and then the next< next time when the market reaches this next time when the market reaches this area area area right< right you know there is a higher chance right you know there is a higher chance that< that the price could just bounce off that the price could just bounce off this< this ceiling and then go back down so this ceiling and then go back down so remember< remember when we are going short we want remember when we are going short we want to< to find to find things< things that are in our favor right where things that are in our favor right where we< we can see that there are certain we can see that there are certain evidence< evidence that the market could be going evidence that the market could be going down< down so in this case we just need these down so in this case we just need these two< two conditions when the market is two conditions when the market is overbought< overbought and when the market is near a overbought and when the market is near a resistance< resistance area so when you put these resistance area so when you put these two< two together you actually have a pretty two together you actually have a pretty uh< uh High probabilistic way of finding out uh High probabilistic way of finding out whether< whether the market can go down or not whether the market can go down or not all< all right so again it's not guaranteed all right so again it's not guaranteed you're< you're going to win some you're going to you're going to win some you're going to lose< lose some but overall you're going to lose some but overall you're going to have< have a positive expectancy trade in the have a positive expectancy trade in the long< long run so now that you've identified long run so now that you've identified that< that the market seems to be you know that the market seems to be you know probably< probably going to turn to go down the probably going to turn to go down the next< next question is you know what are the next question is you know what are the best< best option strategies to use to go best option strategies to use to go short< short all right so there are two short all right so there are two different< different ways that you can go short different ways that you. can go short about< about this so first of all is the about this so first of all is the simplest< simplest way is if you already own a simplest way is if you already own a hundred< hundred shares of the stock right so hundred shares of the stock right so let's< let's say for example you own 100 shares let's say for example you own 100 shares of< of Amazon of Amazon right< right the simplest way would be to just right the simplest way would be to just sell< sell a cover call I've created many sell a cover call I've created many videos< videos of this you can just go ahead to videos of this you can just go ahead to my< my channel and then click any of this my channel and then click any of this cover< cover called videos so as you can see cover called videos so as you can see down< down here if you already have a hundred down here if you already have a hundred shares< shares and then given that right your shares and then given that right your price< price which you bought is below this price which you bought is below this price< price down here below 160 dollars so you price down here below 160 dollars so you can< can employ a cover call can employ a cover call in< in a sense whereby you could either get in a sense whereby you could either get out< out of it for a profit or you could just out of it for a profit or you could just use< use it as a way to generate some income use it as a way to generate some income so< so let's say for example you can sell a so let's say for example you can sell a cover< cover call and it breaches your cover cover call and it breaches your cover call< call you can keep rolling up and up up call you can keep rolling up and up up and< and out again I've created videos on and out again I've created videos on this< this go ahead to my channel and go and this go ahead to my channel and go and watch< watch that alright so the simplest way watch that alright so the simplest way again< again is to sell cover call if you have again is to sell cover call if you have already< already 100 shares so as you can see all already 100 shares so as you can see all the< the conditions are present so the first the conditions are present so the first condition< condition is where the market is condition is where the market is overbought< overbought right the stochastic is overbought right the stochastic is already< already showing that it's above this already showing that it's above this line< line so it's overbought and it's line so it's overbought and it's approaching< approaching this resistance so approaching this resistance so what< what you would do is you will consider what you would do is you will consider selling< selling a cover called Above This selling a cover called Above This resistance< resistance level so you know that the resistance level so you know that the market< market kind of have a little bit of market kind of have a little bit of difficulty< difficulty before it goes back down difficulty before it goes back down right< right so this is a good place for you to right so this is a good place for you to sell< sell the cover call now if you want to sell the cover call now if you want to be< be a little bit more aggressive you be a little bit more aggressive you could< could sell it at 165 if you're a little could sell it at 165 if you're a little bit< bit more conservative you could probably bit more conservative you could probably sell< sell you know a bit higher 175 or above sell you know a bit higher 175 or above okay< okay so as you can see the moment the okay so as you can see the moment the market< market goes up and as you can see it did market goes up and as you can see it did Bridge< Bridge our previous resistance level but Bridge our previous resistance level but then< then as it goes a little bit higher you then as it goes a little bit higher you can< can see the market is severely can see the market is severely overbought overbought overbought that's< that's where the market start to come that's where the market start to come back< back down and the other thing is that if back down and the other thing is that if you< you were to sell a cover call right and you were to sell a cover call right and you< you want to ensure that you know you do you want to ensure that you know you do not< not get called away rather you you want not get called away rather you you want to< to hold the stock for the long term what to hold the stock for the long term what you< you could do is that if the price you could do is that if the price actually< actually you know goes past your cover actually you know goes past your cover call< call it breaches it you could actually call it breaches it you could actually roll< roll up and out as I mentioned earlier roll up and out as I mentioned earlier so< so this way you can keep collecting uh so this way you can keep collecting uh more< more premium more premium and< and eventually if the market goes down and eventually if the market goes down again< again this cover call can expire out of again this cover call can expire out of the< the money so you collected the money the money so you collected the money while< while you hold on to your stock for the while you hold on to your stock for the long< long term long term now< now the other alternative instead of now the other alternative instead of selling< selling the cover call you may want to selling the cover call you may want to sell< sell a cover call ratio spread right I sell a cover call ratio spread right I also< also covered this in a previous video also covered this in a previous video It's< It's called The enhanced cover call you It's called The enhanced cover call you can< can go ahead and click the link at the can go ahead and click the link at the top< top right hand corner of this video but top right hand corner of this video but basically< basically the enhanced or rather the basically the enhanced or rather the cover< cover call ratio spread is where you cover call ratio spread is where you sell< sell uh two calls here and one call sell uh two calls here and one call option< option below that so what this option below that so what this essentially< essentially is is actually a blue call essentially is is actually a blue call spec< spec you have a debit spread from this spec you have a debit spread from this point< point to this point and then you sell point to this point and then you sell one< one cover call down here so you just one cover call down here so you just only< only have one additional shot call at only have one additional shot call at 170< 170 so what this does is that when the 170 so what this does is that when the price< price goes up here you can choose to price goes up here you can choose to sell< sell away your debit spread for a profit sell away your debit spread for a profit and< and then you can roll this additional and then you can roll this additional call< call up here before the market goes down call up here before the market goes down and< and then this cover call will expire out and then this cover call will expire out of< of the money and then you collect the of the money and then you collect the income< income for that so again these are a few income for that so again these are a few ways< ways that you can kind of just you know ways that you can kind of just you know change< change how you do your trade right you change how you do your trade right you can< can have your cover call just simply can have your cover call just simply just< just shot one call you can have a cover just shot one call you can have a cover called< called ratio spread which is a cover called ratio spread which is a cover call< call using that uh income or rather the call using that uh income or rather the premium< premium which you receive from the cover premium which you receive from the cover call< call to finance a bull called spread by call to finance a bull called spread by the< the way if this video has been helpful the way if this video has been helpful so< so far I'd appreciate if you hit the so far I'd appreciate if you hit the thumbs< thumbs up button and also subscribe to thumbs up button and also subscribe to my< my channel so I can create more videos my channel so I can create more videos like< like this for you in the future okay like this for you in the future okay back< back to the video alright so what if you back to the video alright so what if you do< do not have any shares right let's say do not have any shares right let's say you< you are just trading it you do not have you are just trading it you do not have any< any long-term uh shares investment you any long-term uh shares investment you have< have a small account right so in this have a small account right so in this case< case what you want to do the easiest the case what you want to do the easiest the simplest< simplest way to implement the option simplest way to implement the option strategy< strategy would be vertical spreads right strategy would be vertical spreads right so< so you have your credit spread you have so you have your credit spread you have your< your debit spread so in this case is your debit spread so in this case is let's< let's start off with the debit spread let's start off with the debit spread the< the credit spread sorry which is called the credit spread sorry which is called the< the bear call spread so again you can the bear call spread so again you can see< see first of all what you want to look see first of all what you want to look out< out for is for the two conditions to be out for is for the two conditions to be present< present again the market is overbought present again the market is overbought you< you can see that it's a resistance level you can see that it's a resistance level down< down here so what you want to do down here so what you want to do is< is with a backhaul spread is you want to is with a backhaul spread is you want to sell< sell the short call above where the sell the short call above where the resistance< resistance area is right so in this case resistance area is right so in this case you< you can sell one call option all right you can sell one call option all right at< at 460 and then buy back another call at 460 and then buy back another call this< this is to hedge your maximum loss so this is to hedge your maximum loss so this< this way the loss will be the maximum this way the loss will be the maximum of< of the width minus of the credit which of the width minus of the credit which you< you receive so if you receive let's say you receive so if you receive let's say four< four dollars for this uh spread and it's four dollars for this uh spread and it's a< a ten dollars why that means your a ten dollars why that means your maximum< maximum loss will be six dollars which maximum loss will be six dollars which is< is six hundred dollars uh per spread is six hundred dollars uh per spread right< right so in this case you can see that right so in this case you can see that for< for the credit spread we place the short for the credit spread we place the short call< call always above the resistance area if call always above the resistance area if you're< you're a little bit more conservative you're a little bit more conservative you< you may want to place the short call at you may want to place the short call at 470< 470 and then the long call at 480. so in 470 and then the long call at 480.

so in this< this case even though if the market does this case even though if the market does go< go up let's say if the market does go up go up let's say if the market does go up to< to 470 and then it expires there right to 470 and then it expires there right at< at expiration you at least still get the at expiration you at least still get the full< full credit for this credit spread okay full credit for this credit spread okay so< so that's the beauty about the credit so that's the beauty about the credit spread< spread you can still be wrong in a spread you can still be wrong in a direction< direction that means the market can direction that means the market can still< still go up in fact it could still go up still go up in fact it could still go up before< before coming down before coming down you< you still would be able to make the full you still would be able to make the full premium< premium as long as it expires out of the premium as long as it expires out of the money< money below this short call option at money below this short call option at expiration< expiration right so as you can see the expiration right so as you can see the market< market did bounce off our short call as market did bounce off our short call as you< you can see because of the resistance you can see because of the resistance area< area and it's overbought it held off area and it's overbought it held off this< this point and then the market went back this point and then the market went back down< down now the alternative would be the down now the alternative would be the bear< bear put spread so this is a debit bear put spread so this is a debit spread< spread so instead of using the call spread so instead of using the call option< option you use the put option option you use the put option so< so the difference. between a debit spread so the difference between a debit spread and< and a credit spread is that the debit and a credit spread is that the debit spread< spread tends to have a lower probability spread tends to have a lower probability of< of profit right with the credit spread of profit right with the credit spread you< you notice that the market actually you notice that the market actually right< right let's say from this point on the right let's say from this point on the markets< markets still have some room to go all markets still have some room to go all right< right before it comes back down right before it comes back down as< as long as below this point so you have as long as below this point so you have a< a small little margin of error from 450 a small little margin of error from 450 to< to 460 where the market can actually to 460 where the market can actually just< just expire there uh at expiration the just expire there uh at expiration the market< market Capital expiration you still get market Capital expiration you still get the< the full credit but whereas for a debit the full credit but whereas for a debit spread< spread it's a different case right it's spread it's a different case right it's slightly< slightly uh lesser than 50 or sometimes slightly uh lesser than 50 or sometimes you< you can even make 50 percent you can even make 50 percent in< in terms of the probability of profit in terms of the probability of profit right< right the difference is that with a right the difference is that with a debit< debit spread you at least have a better debit spread you at least have a better risk< risk to reward that means you can get risk to reward that means you can get either< either a one is to one risk to reward or either a one is to one risk to reward or sometimes< sometimes you could even get one is to sometimes you could even get one is to 1. 5< 1.

5 or one is two one is two two right 1. 5 or one is two one is two two right so< so that's how you have a trade-off so that's how you have a trade-off between< between the debit spread and the credit between the debit spread and the credit spread< spread now with the credit spread you spread now with the credit spread you can< can actually have a preemptive trade can actually have a preemptive trade that< that means you can actually take on the that means you can actually take on the trade< trade or place the trade once the market trade or place the trade once the market you< you know has reached somewhere this you know has reached somewhere this point< point right it doesn't have to go all point right it doesn't have to go all the< the way to 460 right at this point you the way to 460 right at this point you can< can already initiate the trade so in can already initiate the trade so in case< case if from this point the market goes case if from this point the market goes down< down you will receive the full credit down you will receive the full credit all< all right let me just remove all this all right let me just remove all this drawing< drawing so if the market goes down from drawing so if the market goes down from here< here imagine it doesn't go up here you here imagine it doesn't go up here you will< will still receive the credit now for will still receive the credit now for the< the debit spread the debit spread you< you actually want to wait for the market you actually want to wait for the market to< to go a little bit higher first before to go a little bit higher first before you< you implement the debit spread so that's you implement the debit spread so that's how< how I would like to do it I want to wait how I would like to do it I want to wait for< for the price to actually hit the for the price to actually hit the resistance< resistance level first then I actually resistance level first then I actually enter< enter the bare put spread whereby the enter the bare put spread whereby the long< long put option will be at the long put option will be at the resistance< resistance area so in this case if I resistance area so in this case if I want< want the market let's say for example I want the market let's say for example I want< want to do the debit spread where it's want to do the debit spread where it's 460< 460 to 450 I need to wait for the market 460 to 450 I need to wait for the market to< to actually go to 460 first before I to actually go to 460 first before I implement< implement the debit spread otherwise you implement the debit spread otherwise you know< know you you wouldn't have the right know you you wouldn't have the right kind< kind of uh price that you want right kind of uh price that you want right the< the the cheaper it is is if the market the the cheaper it is is if the market actually< actually goes at the money or slightly actually goes at the money or slightly out< out of the money then this way you will out of the money then this way you will have< have a better risk to reward so you have have a better risk to reward so you have a< a better risk to report but the a better risk to report but the trade-off< trade-off is again you know you may not trade-off is again you know you may not actually< actually get into this trade if the actually get into this trade if the market< market from this point went back down market from this point went back down all< all right so this is where you want to all right so this is where you want to decide< decide you know which is better for you decide you know which is better for you if< if you prefer a better risk to reward if you prefer a better risk to reward ratio< ratio but a lower probability of profit ratio but a lower probability of profit you< you can go with the debit spread but if you can go with the debit spread but if you< you prefer you know a higher probability you prefer you know a higher probability of< of profit then you can go with the of profit then you can go with the credit< credit spread alright so now let's go credit spread alright so now let's go back< back to the Chart which I first showed back to the Chart which I first showed you< you at the beginning of this video and you at the beginning of this video and now< now that we already know the two now that we already know the two conditions< conditions that we're going to look out conditions that we're going to look out for< for we are going to have a much better for we are going to. have a much better information< information for us to decide you know information for us to decide you know whether< whether are we going to place a short whether are we going to place a short position< position or not right are we going to position or not right are we going to place< place a short trade or not so as you can place a short trade or not so as you can see< see we have a uh the stochastics is see we have a uh the stochastics is actually< actually showing that it is just actually showing that it is just crossing< crossing the over board region which crossing the over board region which means< means condition one is fulfilled okay means condition one is fulfilled okay now< now condition two is where there is a now condition two is where there is a resistance< resistance area down here so as you can resistance area down here so as you can see< see we have approached the resistance see we have approached the resistance area< area and there's another resistance area area and there's another resistance area at< at a 200 point at a 200 point and< and a mini one somewhere around down and a mini one somewhere around down here< here which is around 196 dollars so at here which is around 196 dollars so at this< this point the question is are you going this point the question is are you going to< to take a short trade or not so for me to take a short trade or not so for me when< when I take a look at this I do think when I take a look at this I do think there< there is some chance that the market there is some chance that the market could< could go down but then I would prefer to could go down but then I would prefer to see< see if the market is a little bit more see if the market is a little bit more extended< extended as you can see the market did extended as you can see the market did you< you know move down here before it went you know move down here before it went back< back up so this could trigger to me you back up so this could trigger to me you know< know like it could be a new wave up know like it could be a new wave up before< before going back down going back up before going back down going back up again< again so if I were to take this trade if again so if I were to take this trade if I< I want to I would probably want to take I want to I would probably want to take a< a credit spread where I would choose a a credit spread where I would choose a resistance< resistance area at this point and then resistance area at this point and then place< place a credit spread above here around place a credit spread above here around 195< 195 right for me I would prefer to wait 195 right for me I would prefer to wait until< until the 200 level down here which I until the 200 level down here which I feel< feel this is a stronger resistance area feel this is a stronger resistance area since< since it has not been tested yet as you since it has not been tested yet as you can< can see this has been tested quite a few can see this has been tested quite a few times< times you can see it tested once tested times you can see it tested once tested twice< twice now I tested the third time so twice now I tested the third time so whenever< whenever a resistance area or a support whenever a resistance

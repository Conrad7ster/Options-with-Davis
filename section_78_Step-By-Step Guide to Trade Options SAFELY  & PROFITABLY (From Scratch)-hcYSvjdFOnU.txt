account steadily and consistently so I'm going< going to be sharing with you this six going to be sharing with you this six steps< steps especially you know this is from steps especially you know this is from my< my own experience as well as helping my own experience as well as helping numerous< numerous number of people to grow their numerous number of people to grow their account< account all right so step number one is account all right so step number one is to< to choose an options broker so it's to choose an options broker so it's quite< quite important to choose the right quite important to choose the right options< options broker because there are a options broker because there are a number< number of Brokers that actually allow number of Brokers that actually allow you< you to trade options but not many of you to trade options but not many of them< them are actually you know designed to them are actually you know designed to help< help you have a good experience when help you have a good experience when trading< trading options especially when it comes trading options especially when it comes to< to you know constructing the strategy so to you know constructing the strategy so I'm< I'm just going to share with you you I'm just going to share with you you know< know a few of the Brokers that basically know a few of the Brokers that basically would< would be good for trading options and would be good for trading options and also< also what to look out for also what to look out for now< now if you are inside the us then here now if you are inside the us then here are< are a few of the main choices basically are a few of the main choices basically you< you have Robin Hood Fidelity trade you have Robin Hood Fidelity trade station< station interactive brokers tasty trade station interactive brokers tasty trade and< and child sh basically that have bought and child sh basically that have bought over< over TDM trade and think of swim and over TDM trade and think of swim and then< then you have also weu right so inside then you have also weu right so inside the< the US you actually have quite a number the US you actually have quite a number of< of options to choose from now if you're of options to choose from now if you're outside< outside the US then your choices are a outside the US then your choices are a little< little bit more limited and also really little bit more limited and also really depending< depending on you know which part of the depending on you know which part of the world< world you're in so uh any of this uh world you're in so uh any of this uh broker< broker would actually be you know pretty broker would actually be you know pretty okay< okay to trade options now a few things okay to trade options now a few things to< to look up for when you're choosing an to look up for when you're choosing an options< options broker so these are the options broker so these are the important< important details that you really want important details that you really want to< to do your due diligence in and the to do your due diligence in and the first< first one is to actually find out from first one is to actually find out from your< your broker you know what happens to your broker you know what happens to your< your funds and also your positions if it your funds and also your positions if it becomes< becomes insolvent right let's say for becomes insolvent right let's say for example< example if the company goes bankrupt example if the company goes bankrupt what's< what's going to happen right you want to what's going to happen right you want to make< make sure that there is some sort of make sure that there is some sort of maybe< maybe insurance right is it insured by maybe insurance right is it insured by you< you know the FDIC and what is it that you know the FDIC and what is it that they< they do in the event you know they go they do in the event you know they go bankrupt< bankrupt are they going to return you bankrupt are they going to return you your< your funds or are you asked to transfer your funds or are you asked to transfer out< out your position or is this going to be out your position or is this going to be like< like you know previously there was this like you know previously there was this uh< uh brokerage called MF Global where when uh brokerage called MF Global where. when it< it went bankrupt I think a lot of people it went bankrupt I think a lot of people lost< lost their funds along with it so this lost their funds along with it so this is< is what you really need to be clear so is what you really need to be clear so again< again do your due diligence the next again do your due diligence the next thing< thing is to look out for the commissions thing is to look out for the commissions right< right so ideally we want a maximum right so ideally we want a maximum Commission< Commission of $1 per trade so maximum of Commission of $1 per trade so maximum of around< around $2 per round turn so as you can around $2 per round turn so as you can see< see down here uh tasty trade the first see down here uh tasty trade the first one< one actually they have pretty decent one actually they have pretty decent commissions< commissions where it's just $1 per commissions where it's just $1 per contract< contract per L and they do not charge contract per L and they do not charge any< any closing commission so that means if any closing commission so that means if you< you enter and exit it'll be $1 roundt you enter and exit it'll be $1 roundt per< per contract which is actually pretty per contract which is actually pretty good< good so if you trade you know the way good so if you trade you know the way that< that you trade is that you will get in that you trade is that you will get in and< and out of a trade without holding to and out of a trade without holding to expiration< expiration then this would be pretty expiration then this would be pretty good< good for you now if you're inside the us good for you now if you're inside the us then< then you know Robin Hood would be then you know Robin Hood would be something< something that you know many people like something that you know many people like because< because there's no commission right because there's no commission right apparently< apparently according to them they said apparently according to them they said that< that the commission is free so I know of that the commission is free so I know of some< some of my subscribers mention as well some of my subscribers mention as well it's< it's free now if you're outside the US it's free now if you're outside the US you< you won't be able to access this so you you won't be able to access this so you might< might have to go for the other ones now might have to go for the other ones now the< the other ones this one is tdit trade so the other ones this one is tdit trade so tdit< tdit trade is also actually not bad so I tdit trade is also actually not bad so I think< think now it's called Charles shop so at think now it's called Charles shop so at least< least at this point they're charging least at this point they're charging about< about 70 cents per contract so it's about 70 cents per contract so it's pretty< pretty doable right it's still pretty uh pretty doable right it's still pretty uh acceptable< acceptable so round turn is about acceptable so round turn is about a140< a140 now the next thing you also want to a140 now the next thing you also want to look< look at is exercise fees now in this day look at is exercise fees now in this day and< and age you know commissions should be and age you know commissions should be getting< getting very cheap and also you know getting very cheap and also you know most< most of the time you should not be most of the time you should not be paying< paying for you know getting exercise paying for you know getting exercise right< right exercise fees should be zero for right exercise fees should be zero for the< the most part for example TDM trate or the most part for example TDM trate or rather< rather child shop does not charge a fee rather child shop does not charge a fee when< when you exercise but tasty trade when you exercise but tasty trade actually< actually charges a fee right so if you actually charges a fee right so if you are< are the type that likes to hold to are the type that likes to hold to expiration< expiration then you want to you know expiration then you want to you know select< select one of those that actually do not select one of those that actually do not charge< charge you for you know exercising now charge you for you know exercising now next< next this is where you want to look up next this is where you want to look up for< for to see you know what sort of a for to see you know what sort of a interest< interest the broker actually pays you on interest the broker actually pays you on your< your idle cash so right now at least as your idle cash so right now at least as of< of this recording the interest rate is of this recording the interest rate is actually< actually pretty high so you do actually actually pretty high so you do actually want< want to make use of this because Brokers want to make use of this because Brokers are< are actually paying you you know are actually paying you you know interest< interest for any idle cash right so for interest for any idle cash right so for example< example this one is Fidelity you can see example this one is Fidelity you can see that< that Fidelity is paying that Fidelity is paying 4. 97%< 4.

97% on your you know uninvested cash 4. 97% on your you know uninvested cash deposit< deposit so as you can see down here they deposit so as you can see down here they say< say that you know uninvested cash say that you know. uninvested cash deposit< deposit in a Fidelity brokerage account deposit in a Fidelity brokerage account is< is automatically put into a money market is automatically put into a money market fund< fund now earning fund now earning 4.

97%< 4. 97% this one is interactive brokers at 4.

97% this one is interactive brokers at the< the bottom right so Interactive Broker the bottom right so. Interactive Broker says< says that you know you can earn says that you know you can earn 4. 83%< 4.

83% on your idle cash but you must go 4. 83% on your idle cash but you must go and< and read the fine print as well right and read the fine print as well right because< because they say that only if your because they say that only if your account< account size is above account size is above $100,000< $100,000 then you are paid an interest $100,000 then you are paid an interest and< and the first $10,000 has no interest and the first $10,000 has no interest right< right again just go and find your right again just go and find your options< options there are many Brokers that are options there are many Brokers that are going< going to pay you this interest so you to going to pay you this interest so you to find< find out to see which one is good for find out to see which one is good for you< you so especially right now where the you so especially right now where the interest< interest rate is high you do want to interest rate is high you do want to take< take advantage of this but however this take advantage of this but however this is< is mainly inside the US right so if is mainly inside the US right so if you're< you're outside of the US what you find you're outside of the US what you find is< is that the Brokers actually do not give is that the Brokers actually do not give you< you this interest on your idle cash uh you this interest on your idle cash uh interactive< interactive brokers I think they do but interactive brokers I think they do but you< you need a large account but then you you need a large account but then you know< know what if you have a smaller account know what if you have a smaller account what< what can you do so if you outside of the what can you do so if you outside of the US< US then what you can look out for from US then what you can look out for from the< the broker is maybe they have the the broker is maybe they have the ability< ability to purchase t- bills and have a ability to purchase t- bills and have a percentage< percentage of that released as option percentage of that released as option buying< buying power and basically the one that buying power and basically the one that I< I found is uh tasty trade right so as I found is uh tasty trade right so as you< you can see this is tasty trade so you you can see this is tasty trade so you can< can see that for tasty trade they say we can see that for tasty trade they say we margin< margin the T bills at 94% in margin margin the T bills at 94% in margin account< account so. remember you have to open a account so remember you have to open a margin< margin account so what happens is that margin account so what happens is that if< if you were to buy if you were to buy $100,000< $100,000 to and put it into t- bills you $100,000 to and put it into t- bills you would< would still have $94,000 in buying power would still have $94,000 in buying power so< so what it means is that this 100,000 is so what it means is that this 100,000 is actually< actually earning the return the interest actually earning the return the interest from< from the TB right whatever percentage it from the TB right whatever percentage it is< is right I think around right now it's is right I think around right now it's about< about 3 to 4% so you'll be earning on about 3 to 4% so you'll be earning on that that that $400,000< $400,000 now from that $100,000 you can $400,000 now from that $100,000 you can actually< actually use 94% of it and then use it actually use 94% of it and then use it to< to trade options so in this case you to trade options so in this case you actually< actually have a return on a return so if actually have a return on a return so if your< your options is profitable as well then your options is profitable as well then you're< you're going to have an added return now you're going to have an added return now if< if let's say for example you're if let's say for example you're experiencing< experiencing a draw down then hey at experiencing a draw down then hey at least< least the interest from the T bill can least the interest from the T bill can help< help you you know cushion some of the help you you know cushion some of the losses< losses so this is what I've actually losses so this is what I've actually done< done so as you can see down here I've done so as you can see down here I've bought< bought like 210 t- bills so how T BS bought like 210 t- bills so how T BS basically< basically work just a very quick run basically work just a very quick run through< through is that you actually buy them at through is that you actually buy them at a< a discount right right so the full face a discount right right so the full face value< value for this on tasty trade is $1,000 value for this on tasty trade is $1,000 you< you know for each of these T bills so you know for each of these T bills so for< for this one you can see I bought each for this one you can see I bought each one< one for an average price of $960.

30 so one for an average price of $960. 30 so this< this is where it will start off with and this is where it will start off with and over< over time this price will start to go over time this price will start to go all< all the way up until it's the full price all the way up until it's the full price at< at maturity right at maturity will be at maturity right at maturity will be $1,000< $1,000 that's the face value of this t- $1,000 that's the face value of this t- B< B so this is how the T bills work now B so this is how the T bills work now next< next is the ability to see existing next is the ability to see existing positions< positions on the option ch so for me positions on the option ch so for me this< this is actually pretty important this is actually pretty important because< because I do trade you know multiple because I do trade you know multiple positions< positions on you know the underlyings positions on you know the underlyings that< that I trade so that means on each of that I trade so that means on each of the< the underline that I have I can have two the underline that I have I can have two three< three four five positions going on and three four five positions going on and that's< that's why it's important for me to see that's why it's important for me to see these< these existing positions because if you these existing positions because if you do< do not realize you have an existing do not realize you have an existing position< position on the strike price you could position on the strike price you could actually< actually cancel out that trade right so actually cancel out that trade right so let's< let's say for example you can see down let's say for example you can see down here< here any rate marking tells me that I here any rate marking tells me that I have< have any you know short position on that have any you know short position on that strike< strike so you can see down here 185 I strike so you can see down here 185 I have< have a short strike 189 I have the short have a short strike 189 I have the short option< option as well and for 187 if you see option as well and for 187 if you see green< green it means that I have a long strike green it means that I have a long strike so< so as you can see long strike as well so so as you can see long strike as well so this< this is where it's very important this is where it's very important because< because if your broker does not show because if your broker does not show your< your existing position on the option your existing position on the option chain< chain now if you have a new trade you chain now if you have a new trade you want< want to place and let's say for example want to place and let's say for example it's< it's the same DTE you want to put on you it's the same DTE you want to put on you do< do not know where's your existing strike do not know where's your existing strike so< so let's say for example you have no so let's say for example you have no idea< idea what you're going to do is you're idea what you're going to do is you're going< going and place a short strike at one 7 going and place a short strike at one 7 and< and then you put a long strike at5 if and then you put a long strike at5 if you< you do that what's going to happen is you do that what's going to happen is that< that you're going to cancel all any that you're going to cancel all any existing< existing position you have on that existing position you have on that strike< strike because you cannot have two strike because you cannot have two opposing< opposing trades on the same strike right opposing trades on the same strike right so< so one short one long will naturally so one short one long will naturally cancel< cancel that out and if this is part of cancel that out and if this is part of another< another strategy so let's say for another strategy so let's say for example< example you put on the iron Condor this example you put on the iron Condor this is< is like for example the put side the put is like for example the put side the put leg< leg of the iron Condor if you're going leg of the iron Condor if you're going to< to put another trade on that cancels out to put another trade on that cancels out these< these two trades you're going to find these two trades you're going to find that< that your iron condor suddenly has no that your iron condor suddenly has no leg< leg on the put side right you only have leg on the put side right you only have the< the call side and it kind of destroys the call side and it kind of destroys everything< everything so for me this is important everything so for me this is important so< so for you you know if you want to avoid so for you you know if you want to avoid this< this problem in the future if you plan this problem in the future if you plan to< to have you know more than you know one to have you know more than you know one position< position on the same underlying then you position on the same underlying then you definitely< definitely want to look out for the definitely want to look out for the broker< broker that shows this position Next broker that shows this position Next Step< Step number two and that is to plan out Step number two and that is to plan out your< your risk management to me this is very your risk management to me this is very very< very important because you should not very important because you should not get< get into any trade unless you have get into any trade unless you have already< already figured out your risk management already figured out your risk management right< right so what does risk management right so what does risk management entail< entail right basically is what is the entail right basically is what is the max< max risk on each trade that you want max risk on each trade that you want right< right one of them is you need to know right one of them is you need to know upfront< upfront how much you're planning to risk upfront how much you're planning to risk on<. on each trade so usually this is a on each trade so usually this is a percentage< percentage some people like to use percentage some people like to use dollar< dollar amounts right but if you want to dollar amounts right but if you want to keep< keep things consistent you want to go keep things consistent you want to go something< something for a percentage of your something for a percentage of your account< account so this can be anywhere from 1% account so this can be anywhere from 1% to< to 10% and again really depends on you to 10% and again really depends on you know< know how big your account size is and know how big your account size is and how< how many underlying all strategies that how many underlying all strategies that you're< you're actually trading so a general you're actually trading so a general rule< rule of thumb is that if you have a rule of thumb is that if you have a smaller< smaller account then you want to go you smaller account then you want to go you know< know towards a higher percentage and if know towards a higher percentage and if you< you have a much larger account then you you have a much larger account then you want< want to go for a lower percentage and want to go for a lower percentage and next< next is also you need to figure out next is also you need to figure out what's< what's the position sizing on each trade what's the position sizing on each trade right< right so this depends also on what is right so this depends also on what is your< your risk per trade and from there you your risk per trade and from there you can< can decide you know how wide of a width can decide you know how wide of a width you< you want for the trade let's say for you want for the trade let's say for example< example if you're trading spreads and example if you're trading spreads and then< then from there how many contracts all then from there how many contracts all this< this you need to plan in advance and this you need to plan in advance and also< also what is the total Max allocation of also what is the total Max allocation of your< your Capital you will use at one time so your Capital you will use at one time so over< over here is a table and this table is over here is a table and this table is created< created by the tasty trade team so they created by the tasty trade team so they just< just give a very general guideline as to just give a very general guideline as to how< how you're going to allocate your buying how you're going to allocate your buying power< power depending on the vix level right power depending on the vix level right so< so as you can see down here if the vix so as you can see down here if the vix is< is very low generally you want to is very low generally you want to allocate< allocate around allocate around 25%< 25% maximum of your buying power so 25% maximum of your buying power so let's< let's say for example if you have let's say for example if you have $10,000< $10,000 then you just want to reach 25% $10,000 then you just want to reach 25% maximum< maximum around you know the 10 to 15 vix maximum around you know the 10 to 15 vix level< level so let's say for example if each level so let's say for example if each trade< trade takes 5% what that just means is trade takes 5% what that just means is that< that you want to have a maximum of five that you want to have a maximum of five trades< trades right so five trades of 5% each trades right so five trades of 5% each that< that is 25% now if the vix is much that is 25% now if the vix is much higher< higher let's say it's around 40 plus higher let's say it's around 40 plus then< then you can allocate up to 50% of your then you can allocate up to 50% of your total< total buying power right 50% of your total buying power right 50% of your Capital< Capital so if you have Capital so if you have $10,000< $10,000 then the max you will use up at $10,000 then the max you will use up at any< any one time will be up to $55,000 right any one time will be up to $55,000 right so< so if you have a risk of let's say 5% so if you have a risk of let's say 5% that< that will mean 10 trades if you have a that will mean 10 trades if you have a risk< risk of maybe 1% then that could be 50 risk of maybe 1% then that could be 50 trades< trades right so for me I just ad her to trades right so for me I just ad her to a< a maximum of around 50% sometime I may a maximum of around 50% sometime I may push< push a little bit more most of the time push a little bit more most of the time I< I be around 50% right so as long as you I be around 50% right so as long as you do< do not exceed this 50% you can put on as do not exceed this 50% you can put on as many< many trades as you want all right so many trades as you want all right so this< this is on risk management Next Step this is on risk management Next Step number< number three you want to just choose one number three you want to just choose one option< option strategy to focus on by the way option strategy to focus on by the way if< if you like this video so far Please if you like this

com blueprint over to options with davis. com blueprint all< all right back to the video right all right back to the video right especially< especially if you are starting out you especially if you are starting out you do< do not want to over overwhelm yourself do not want to over overwhelm yourself confuse< confuse yourself with so many different confuse yourself with so many different option< option strategy just focus on one option option strategy just focus on one option strategy< strategy at the start master that and strategy at the start master that and then< then after that you can start to you then after that you can start to you know< know add more strategies to Your Arsenal know add more strategies to Your Arsenal so< so the question you have to ask yourself so the question you have to ask yourself you< you know what is this one option you know what is this one option strategy< strategy to focus on should it be strategy to focus on should it be defined< defined risk or undefined risk now this defined risk or undefined risk now this really< really depends on your account size and really depends on your account size and also< also you know where you are in terms of also you know where you are in terms of you< you know experience in options so you know experience in options so generally< generally if you have a small account generally if you have a small account then< then you pretty much have no choice to then you pretty much have no choice to go< go only with the defined risk strategies go only with the defined risk strategies now< now if there are some underlyings that now if there are some underlyings that is< is very cheap let's say for example $10 is very cheap let's say for example $10 or< or under then those cases will be an or under then those cases will be an exception< exception because you may have no choice exception because you may have no choice but< but to go with the undefined because but to go with the undefined because going< going with defined just does not make going with defined just does not make sense< sense right so in those cases you sense right so in those cases you probably< probably can go for the undefined ones probably can go for the undefined ones but< but for the most part go for the Define but for the most part go for the Define risk< risk because this way you already have risk because this way you already have your< your max loss kept at the start you your max loss kept at the start you don't< don't have to worry about you know one don't have to worry about you know one loss< loss that will wipe out your account now loss that will wipe out your account now if< if you have a large account go with if you have a large account go with undefined< undefined risk strategies but generally undefined risk strategies but generally as< as I mentioned if you're just starting as I mentioned if you're just starting out< out trading options just start off with out trading options just start off with Define< Define risk strategy because the max Define risk strategy because the max loss< loss is kept so now that we have already loss is kept so now that we have already decided< decided that we should focus on the decided that we should focus on the defined< defined risk strategies exactly which defined risk strategies exactly which strategy< strategy should you focus on right strategy should you focus on right because< because there are many different because there are many different strategies< strategies in the option world and one strategies in the option world and one could< could get easily lost so I'm just going could get easily lost so I'm just going to< to give you a few and I'm just going to to give you a few and I'm just going to give< give you my suggestion on which one you give you my suggestion on which one you can< can begin with first so the very first can begin with first so the very first one< one is you know the very popular credit one is you know the very popular credit spreads< spreads right so credit spreads come in spreads right so credit spreads come in two< two types right the very first is the two types right the very first is the bull< bull put spread or basically What's bull put spread or basically What's called< called the put credit spread and then called the put credit spread and then you< you also have the bare call spread or you also have the bare call spread or What's< What's called the call Credit spread so What's called the call Credit spread so credit< credit spreads very popular but they are credit spreads very popular but they are more< more directional in a sense whereby you more directional in a sense whereby you do< do want to get right on the direction do want to get right on the direction otherwise< otherwise you know this trade can tend otherwise you know this trade can tend to< to lose the next one is iron Condor so to lose the next one is iron Condor so if< if you're not that good at picking if you're not that good at picking direction< direction or you just do not want to direction or you just do not want to pick< pick Direction you just want to play you pick Direction you just want to play you know< know what's called the expected move know what's called the expected move right< right and have an edge in the long term right and have an edge in the long term then< then you can trade the iron Condor right then you can trade the iron Condor right because< because iron Condor you do not really because iron Condor you do not really have< have to pick any direction you just have have to pick any direction you just have to< to put it on and just see you know over to put it on and just see you know over time< time does it actually give you an time does it actually give you an overall< overall net profit right so there are overall net profit right so there are certain< certain mechanics that you have to certain mechanics that you have to follow< follow in order for you to have the edge follow in order for you to have the edge and< and on my channel I've already created and on my channel I've already created numerous< numerous number of videos on this so I numerous number of videos on this so I won't< won't go into details of choosing the won't go into details of choosing the strike< strike price and the DTE here because strike price and the DTE here because you< you can just go to my channel I'm just you can just go to my channel I'm just going< going to give you an overall big picture going to give you an overall big picture and< and then after that you can further you and then after that you can further you know< know do the research and study into you know do the research and study into you know< know the individual strategy that you know the individual strategy that you have< have chosen in my channel so basically have chosen in my channel so basically this< this is the ion Condor good for you if this is the ion Condor good for you if you< you do not like to pick directions now you do not like to pick directions now next< next is what is called omnidirectional next is what is called omnidirectional strategies< strategies and omnidirectional strategies and omnidirectional strategies< strategies have the highest win rate of strategies have the highest win rate of you< you know all the strategies that I you know all the strategies that I shared< shared here so omnidirectional shared here so omnidirectional strategies< strategies basically are strategies strategies basically are strategies whereby< whereby if the market goes up you can whereby if the market goes up you can make< make some profit Market stays in the make some profit Market stays in the middle< middle you can be profit Market comes middle you can be profit Market comes down< down you can actually make even more down you can actually make even more profit< profit as long as it does not go way too profit as long as it does not go way too down< down so omnidirectional strategies are down so omnidirectional strategies are pretty< pretty good especially if you're pretty good especially if you're starting< starting out because you have many many starting out because you have many many different< different profit zones and in a way it's different profit zones and in a way it's pretty< pretty defensive because you have the pretty defensive because you have the way< way to construct it whereby the market way to construct it whereby the market comes< comes down you can actually make quite a comes down you can actually make quite a bit< bit more and as you you know most of us bit more and as you you know most of us are< are afraid that the market actually goes are afraid that the market actually goes down< down right we are afraid of the market down right we are afraid of the market crashes< crashes and people always talk about crashes and people always talk about what< what about those Black Swan events so on what about those Black Swan events so on and< and so forth so when you trade and so forth so when you trade omnidirectional< omnidirectional strategies at least if omnidirectional strategies at least if the< the market goes down right you still the market goes down right you still have< have an opportunity to make even more have an opportunity to make even more then< then if the market goes up but if the then if the market goes up but if the market< market goes up hey at least you still market goes up hey at least you still make< make something so the very first one is make something so the very first one is What's< What's called the Jade iron Condor so as What's called the Jade iron Condor so as you< you can see down here it's very similar you can see down here it's very similar to< to the iron condo the previous one as to the iron condo the previous one as you< you can see there are both the put you can see there are both the put spread< spread and the call spread but the spread and the call spread but the difference< difference is that the call spread difference is that the call spread you'll< you'll notice is much smaller right it's you'll notice is much smaller right it's much< much smaller mainly because we do not much smaller mainly because we do not want< want any risk to the upside so we will want any risk to the upside so we will craft< craft it in a way whereby even though if craft it in a way whereby even though if the< the market goes up you still can profit the market goes up you still can profit but< but this is where we're going to make but this is where we're going to make the< the most profit is where it's inside the the most profit is where it's inside the max< max profit zone now the next max profit zone now the next omnidirectional< omnidirectional strategy is What's omnidirectional strategy is What's called< called the put broken wing butterfly so called the put broken wing butterfly so the< the put brokering butterfly is even more the put brokering butterfly is even more defensive< defensive than the J Condor because the defensive than the J Condor because the max< max profit zone is is really somewhere max profit zone is is really somewhere around< around here right down here so this around here right down here so this strategy< strategy tends to make the most if the strategy tends to make the most if the market< market actually comes down into the market actually comes down into the profit< profit Zone down here so when you're profit Zone down here so when you're trading< trading this strategy you actually do trading this strategy you actually do want< want the market to come down but if the want the market to come down but if the market< market goes up you do not worry as well market goes up you do not worry as well because< because there is no loss on the upside because there is no loss on the upside so< so similar to the Jade iron Gondor no so similar to the Jade iron Gondor no loss< loss on the upside if it goes up you loss on the upside if it goes up you still< still get some profit and one good thing still get some profit and one good thing is< is that it actually benefits your is that it actually benefits your psychology< psychology because a lot of people like psychology because a lot of people like I< I mentioned afraid that the market comes I mentioned afraid that the market comes down< down but when you put on the P broking down but when you put on the P broking butterfly< butterfly strategies what you'll find butterfly strategies what you'll find out< out is that you're actually looking out is that you're actually looking forward< forward to the market going down because forward to the market going down because this< this where your max profit zone is this where your max profit zone is unlike< unlike the iron condo and the bull put unlike the iron condo and the bull put spread< spread now the last omnidirectional spread now the last omnidirectional strategy< strategy is What's called the put Condor strategy is What's called the put Condor so< so the put Condor again very similar to so the put Condor again very similar to the< the put broking butterfly but this time the put broking butterfly but this time we< we have a much bigger profit zone right we have a much bigger profit zone right a< a much wider profit Zone and we're only a much wider profit Zone and we're only using< using puts for this right so the whole using puts for this right so the whole idea< idea of this strategy is to have a very idea of this strategy is to have a very defensive< defensive uh structure whereby number defensive uh structure whereby number one< one you have your put credit spread so one you have your put credit spread so you< you want it to be slightly bullish but you want it to be slightly bullish but you're< you're afraid the market comes down you're afraid the market comes down right< right so if you're afraid that the right so if you're afraid that the market< market comes down what you do is you market comes down what you do is you take< take some of the credit you receive from take some of the credit you receive from the< the put credit spread purchase this put the put credit spread purchase this put debit< debit spread so if the market comes down debit spread so if the market comes down you< you can profit on this put debit spread you can profit on this put debit spread and< and again I've already created a video and again I've already created a video specifically< specifically on this strategy if you're specifically on this strategy if you're interested< interested just go ahead to my channel interested just go ahead to my channel and< and then just look for that now any of and then just look for that now any of these< these strategies down here I would say these strategies down here I would say is< is pretty suitable for you if you're is pretty suitable for you if you're starting< starting out but if you want to become starting out but if you want to become profitable< profitable quickly that means you want profitable quickly that means you want to< to have you know more wins than losses to have you know more wins than losses you< you want to see your account you know you want to see your account you know start< start to grow pretty consistently then start to grow pretty consistently then what< what I would suggest is to go more for what I would suggest is to go more for this< this omnidirectional strategies so this this omnidirectional strategies so this omnidirectional< omnidirectional strategies have the most omnidirectional strategies have the most consistent< consistent results and this is something consistent results and this is something that< that I also encourage you know many that I also encourage you know many people< people to start off with if they are people to start off with if they are brand< brand new now next step number four is brand new now next step number four is to< to decide the underlying that you want to decide the underlying that you want to< to trade so now we have already chosen to trade so now we have already chosen the< the broker we've already gotten our risk the broker we've already gotten our risk management< management and we've already decided management and we've already decided which< which strategy we want now the next which strategy we want now the next thing< thing is to choose the underlying so how thing is to choose the underlying so how do< do you choose the underlying so do you choose the underlying so generally< generally for this case what I like to generally for this case what I like to do< do is to use this strategy that I've do is to use this strategy that I've already< already Chosen and then find the right already Chosen and then find the right underlying< underlying that suits our strategy right underlying that suits our strategy right so< so this is how I do it so if I know the so this is how I do it so if I know the strategy< strategy that I chose has a certain strategy that I chose has a certain characteristic< characteristic I want to find the characteristic I want to find the underlying< underlying that will kind of benefit the underlying that will kind of benefit the most< most from it right so for example if I most from it right so for example if I choose< choose the put broken wing butterfly choose the put broken wing butterfly what< what it means is that I want an underly what it means is that I want an underly that< that actually has positive drifts that actually has positive drifts basically< basically positive drift is whereby the basically positive drift is whereby the market< market just wants to keep going up over market just wants to keep going up over time< time so what kind of underlying have time so what kind of underlying have this< this characteristics basically is the this characteristics basically is the index< index ETFs so basically there are two index ETFs so basically there are two types< types of underlying that you can choose types of underlying that you can choose from< from right you have individual stocks from right you have individual stocks and< and you have index ETFs but my and you have index ETFs but my suggestion< suggestion for you especially if you're suggestion for you especially if you're starting< starting from scratch you're new to starting from scratch you're new to trading< trading options I would suggest index trading options I would suggest index ETFs< ETFs right so if you're just starting ETFs right so if you're just starting out< out go with index ETFs well one of the out go with index ETFs well one of the main< main reasons is because index ETFs main reasons is because index ETFs actually< actually don't move as much right so you actually don't move as much right so you can< can see over here this is a study done can see over here this is a study done by< by the tasty trade research team where by the tasty trade research team where they< they went to compare the movements they went to compare the movements between< between ETFs and stocks and what you between ETFs and stocks and what you will< will see down here is that for ETFs they will see down here. is that for ETFs they tend< tend to stay in a much more narrow lower tend to stay in a much more narrow lower range< range compared to stocks stocks is much range compared to stocks stocks is much wider< wider so when we are trading premium wider so when we are trading premium selling< selling option strategies right selling option strategies right especially< especially you know some of the especially you know some of the strategies< strategies I just shared with you we do strategies I just shared with you we do not< not want the underlying to move so much not want the underlying to move so much to< to test our short strike also with index to test our short strike also with index ETFs< ETFs there are no earnings so you can ETFs there are no earnings so you can continuously< continuously put on trades next why we continuously put on trades next why we also< also want to choose index ETS because also want to choose index ETS because bad< bad news on a specific stock doesn't bad news on a specific stock doesn't move< move the index ETF as much so as you can move the index ETF as much so as you can see< see bad news really affect the see bad news really affect the individual< individual stocks a lot right so this is individual stocks a lot right so this is Disney< Disney you can see that Disney stock Disney you can see that Disney stock basically< basically got affected uh whenever such basically got affected uh whenever such news< news comes up like for example there's a news comes up like for example there's a b< b launch this Avatar SQL fails and the b launch this Avatar SQL fails and the stock< stock price is down 45% right that is a stock price is down 45% right that is a very< very big move so you know if you put on very big move so you know if you put on you< you know some of the strategy I share you know some of the strategy I share with< with you although those strategies win with you although those strategies win most< most of the time one of this big move most of the time one of this big move can< can really wipe out a big part of your can really wipe out a big part of your winnings< winnings and finally there are already winnings and finally there are already lots< lots of studies and research done on lots of studies and research done on index< index ETFs to show that you can actually index ETFs to show that you can actually have< have an edge in the long term so as you have an edge in the long term so as you can< can see this is the studies done by the can see this is the studies done by the tasty< tasty trade research team again when tasty trade research team again when we're< we're trading any strategy we want to we're trading any strategy we want to lean< lean on Research right we want to lean lean on Research right we want to lean on< on study because how else will you know on study because how else will you know that< that there's going to be you know that there's going to be you know profitability< profitability in the long term so you profitability in the long term so you want< want to lean on all these studies as want to lean on all these studies as much< much as possible compared to if you do much as possible compared to if you do not< not have any studies to lean on and not have any studies to lean on and you're< you're just leaning on your own you're just leaning on your own understanding< understanding which is not enough right understanding which is not enough right every< every time when we come to trading any every time when we come to trading any of< of the strategies we want to be of the strategies we want to be objective< objective rather than subjective objective rather than subjective objective< objective so as you can see down here objective so as you can see down here this< this studies are usually all done on the this studies are usually all done on the index< index ETFs like spy rwm so on and so index ETFs like spy rwm so on and so forth< forth so next step number five and this forth so next step number five and this is< is a very very important one and one is a very very important one and one that< that I really stress on that everybody that I really stress on that everybody actually< actually does is to plan out all your actually does is to plan out all your trade< trade scenarios right so how many times trade scenarios right so how many times you< you know maybe you've experienced it is you know maybe you've experienced it is that< that when you put on the trade and then that when you put on the trade and then all< all sudden the market crashes or the all sudden the market crashes or the market< market goes all the way up or it tests market goes all the way up or it tests any< any of your strikes and you're not sure any of your strikes and you're not sure what< what to do you'll be surprised I get so what to do you'll be surprised I get so many< many emails from you know my subscribers many emails from you know my subscribers they< they sent me an email saying that hey they sent me an email saying that hey Davis< Davis my position you know so and so has Davis my position you know so and so has been< been caught and now I'm losing a lot of been caught and now I'm losing a lot of money< money what should I do right my take is money what should I do right my take is that< that if you can reach out to me or that if you can reach out to me or anyone< anyone to ask for help on what to do you anyone to ask for help on what to do you shouldn't< shouldn't be in that position in the shouldn't be in that position in the first< first place because you should have first place because you should have already< already planned out all trade scenarios already planned out all trade scenarios including< including your worst scenario and including your worst scenario and already< already know what to do beforehand so already know what to do beforehand so all< all you got to do is follow your plan all you got to do is follow your plan right< right if the market crashes the market right if the market crashes the market goes< goes up test your strikes whatever the goes up test your strikes whatever the market< market does you already have you know market does you already have you know all< all your scenarios laid out a plan that all your scenarios laid out a plan that is< is right in front of you just go to that is right in front of you just go to that part< part where it says oh if the market part where it says oh if the market comes< comes to you know all the way down I comes to you know all the way down I already< already have a plan I'm going to just already have a plan I'm going to just execute< execute it right so this is very execute it right so this is very important< important so what this step basically important so what this step basically just< just means is to plan out every possible just means is to plan out every possible scenario< scenario that can happen after you enter scenario that can happen after you enter into< into a trade so what this is also it into a trade so what this is also it helps< helps you you know face the reality of helps you you know face the reality of trading< trading face the worst thing that can trading face the worst thing that can happen< happen because you'll be surprised right happen because you'll be surprised right A< A lot of people do not like to face A lot of people do not like to face what's< what's the worst scenario that can what's the worst scenario that can happen< happen because I did ask many people as happen because I did ask many people as well< well you know hey what if the market well you know hey what if the market crashes< crashes and your position is tested what crashes and your position is tested what do< do you do well a lot of times the answer do you do well a lot of times the answer will< will be I don't know yet right let me will be I don't know yet right let me just< just get to that point and then I'll just get to that point and then I'll decide< decide later well if that point actually decide later well if that point actually comes< comes and you don't know what to do then comes and you don't know what to do then you're< you're in for for a very painful ride so you're in for for a very painful ride so again< again you must plan it out so how do you again you must plan it out so how do you plan< plan it out so these are some of the plan it out so these are some of the questions< questions you need to ask yourself right questions you need to ask yourself right like< like for example what will you do if the like for example what will you do if the market< market goes up what will you do if the market goes up what will you do if the market< market goes down what will you do if the market goes down what will you do if the market< market goes sideways what will you do if market goes sideways what will you do if your< your strikes get tested where will you your strikes get tested where will you take< take profit where will you cut loss take profit where will you cut loss where< where will you roll and if you do roll where will you roll and if you do roll when< when and how will you roll and when will when and how will you roll and when will you< you exit right all these are questions you exit right all these are questions you< you must have answers too so what I'm you must have answers too so what I'm going< going to do right now is just give you going to do right now is just give you you< you know a trade example and just show you know a trade example and just show you< you how you can map out all the you how you can map out all the different< different scenarios and have a plan for different scenarios and have a plan for it< it right so uh there are actually many it right so uh there are actually many different< different scenarios for each trade so different scenarios for each trade so I'm< I'm just going to give you a few let's I'm just going to give you a few let's say< say for example you have a trade so this say for example you have a trade so this is< is the trade let's say you plan to put is the trade let's say you plan to put it< it on is to sell this $5 wi booo spread it on is to sell this $5 wi booo spread all< all right 175 170 with the 50 DTE for all right 175 170 with the 50 DTE for $130< $130 so again you want to be as specific $130 so again you want to be as specific as< as possible and then you want to map out as possible and then you want to map out the< the scenarios now so scenario number one the scenarios now so scenario number one let's< let's say the market goes up right to let's say the market goes up right to one5< one5 or it goes up in general and your one5 or it goes up in general and your bput< bput spread is now 60% in the profit and bput spread is now 60% in the profit and there's< there's 30 DTE left what do you do right there's 30 DTE left what do you do right you< you need to have an answer for this so you need to have an answer for this so I'm< I'm just going to give you a guideline I'm just going to give you a guideline is< is that generally there are just three is that generally there are just three decisions< decisions right just three decisions decisions right just three decisions that< that you have to face and that is do you that you have to face and that is do you hold< hold right or basically just means you hold right or basically just means you do< do nothing or should you roll it or do nothing or should you roll it or should< should you close it right basically just should you close it right basically just these< these three things then you have to these three things then you have to decide< decide for yourself so this is scenario decide for yourself so this is scenario one< one then maybe the next scenario you one then maybe the next scenario you want< want to plan is if the market goes up want to plan is if the market goes up and< and your poo spread is in 40% profit and and your poo spread is in 40% profit and that's< that's 21 DTE what do you do again do that's 21 DTE what do you do again do you< you hold roll or close you need to have you hold roll or close you need to have an< an answer scenario number three Market an answer scenario number three Market stay< stay flat right around $180 your buo stay flat right around $180 your buo spread< spread is in 20% profit and there's 30 spread is in 20% profit and there's 30 DTE< DTE left do you hold do you roll do you DTE left do you hold do you roll do you close< close you want to find an answer that is close you want to find an answer that is suitable< suitable for yourself scenario four suitable for yourself scenario four now< now this is where things get a little now this is where things get a little bit< bit tough right scenario 1 2 3 is bit tough right scenario 1 2 3 is basically< basically when you are in a profit right basically when you are in a profit right but< but now this is where you could start to but now this is where you could start to see< see a loss and this is where you really see a loss and this is where you really really< really need to have a very clear plan on really need to have a very clear plan on what< what to do so scenario 4 One Thing can what to do so scenario 4 One Thing can definitely< definitely happen so let's say for definitely happen so let's say for example< example you have a buut spread Market example you have a buut spread Market comes< comes down test your short strike what comes down test your short strike what do< do you do right do you hold do you roll do you do right do you hold do you roll do< do you close now scenario number five do you close now scenario number five what< what if the market just simply blows go what if the market just simply blows go through< through your strikes right it goes even through your strikes right it goes even below< below your long strike now it's almost below your long strike now it's almost at< at Max loss with 21 DT left what do you at Max loss with 21 DT left what do you do< do ho Ru or close you need to find a do ho Ru or close you need to find a plan< plan that suits you so for some people plan that suits you so for some people it< it might be just a hold because there's it might be just a hold because there's not< not much left to lose for some people is not much left to lose for some people is to< to just exit it very mechanically to just exit it very mechanically because< because it's 21 DTE for some people is because it's 21 DTE for some people is to< to prolong the trade is to roll again to prolong the trade is to roll again find< find one plan suits you stick with that find one plan suits you stick with that and< and finally step number six once you and finally step number six once you plan< plan up everything plan up everything especially< especially for step number five time to especially for step number five time to place< place your trade and execute your plan place your trade and execute your plan so< so a few things to look out for so first so a few things to look out for so first of< of all just as you start to construct of all just as you start to construct your< your trade make sure that you see a net your trade make sure that you see a net credit< credit so some people have actually made credit so some people have actually made this< this mistake before some people have this mistake before some people have reached< reached out to me they said that they reached out to me they said that they actually< actually thought it was a credit but it actually thought it was a credit but it turns< turns out to be a debit and now the turns out to be a debit and now the trade< trade is not as you know good as what trade is not as you know good as what they< they thought it should be so always they thought it should be so always ensure< ensure you see a credit okay now next ensure you see a credit okay now next when< when you already decided on the credit when you already decided on the credit that< that you want this is where you want to that you want this is where you want to you< you know adjust the price a little so you know adjust the price a little so what< what I like to do is to always start off what I like to do is to always start off with< with the mid price so when you place the with the mid price so when you place the trade< trade what you notice is that there'll trade what you notice is that there'll be< be this slider right at least for most be this slider right at least for most Brokers< Brokers they should have that so what Brokers they should have that so what they< they will show should be the mid price they will show should be the mid price and< and the natural price so natural price and the natural price so natural price is< is Nat for short basically this is where is Nat for short basically this is where you< you are pretty much guaranteed to get Fu you are pretty much guaranteed to get Fu right< right so when we are doing this uh right so when we are doing this uh trades< trades basically we are trading this trades basically we are trading this premium< premium selling options we want to get premium selling options we want to get as< as high of a credit as possible so I'll as high of a credit as possible so I'll start< start off with somewhere around mid and start off with somewhere around mid and then< then I will gradually just shift it then I will gradually just shift it lower< lower and lower until I finally get fi lower and lower until I finally get fi which< which is near the Natural price so let's which is near the Natural price so let's say< say for example I may start off with say for example I may start off with 1.

99< 1. 99 if I put the trade in I do not see 1.

99 if I put the trade in I do not see that< that I get Fu I'm just going to adjust that I get Fu I'm just going to adjust it< it right this can be you know a few it right this can be you know a few seconds< seconds maybe up to a minute or seconds maybe up to a minute or something< something like that especially if I want something like that especially if I want to< to get filled now if you do not mind to get filled now if you do not mind waiting< waiting and this is the price that you waiting and this is the price that you actually< actually want to get filled then you can actually want to get filled then you can just< just put it in the market right there's just put it in the market right there's no< no need for you to adjust if you do not no need for you to adjust if you do not want< want to get filled immediately but if want to get filled immediately but if you< you want to get filled immediately then you want to get filled immediately then you< you just have to keep adjusting as you you just have to keep adjusting as you can< can see adjust it bit by bit until can see adjust it bit by bit until finally< finally you get fill now once you're finally you get fill now once you're filled< filled you can set your take profit now filled you can set your take profit now this< this is optional right because some this is optional right because some people< people like to just exit the trade at 21 people like to just exit the trade at 21 DTE< DTE especially you know those who follow DTE especially you know those who follow those< those tasty trade mechanics if you want those tasty trade mechanics if you want to< to get out 21 DTE then no need for you to get out 21 DTE then no need for you to< to place take profit but if you want to to place take profit but if you want to add< add her to some take profit maybe 50% add her to some take profit maybe 50% 40%< 40% 90% whatever it is just put the 40% 90% whatever it is just put the trade< trade in right rather put in the order trade in right rather put in the order to< to just simply do the takeprofit this to just simply do the takeprofit this way< way you don't have to always monitor the way you don't have to always monitor the market< market finally the last one now that you market finally the last one now that you have< have gotten everything in it's time to have gotten everything in it's time to execute< execute the plan that You' set out in execute the plan that You' set out in step< step five so again very important if you step five so again very important if. you already< already have this planned out in step already have this planned out in step five< five you need to stick with it because five you need to stick with it because many< many times you'll find that some people many times you'll find that some people have< have the plan and then when you know the have the plan and then when you know the losses< losses actually hit the worst scenario losses actually hit the worst scenario actually< actually hit suddenly people just don't actually hit suddenly people just don't want< want to stick with the plan right want to stick with the plan right because< because they're thinking that you know because they're thinking that you know they< they have this hope what if the market they have this hope what if the market you< you know reverses and if I take a loss you know reverses and if I take a loss now< now you know I will regret it because if now you know I will regret it because if the< the market goes up I could be in a the market goes up I could be in a profit< profit but on the other hand it could profit but on the other hand it could work< work the other way as well because what work the other way as well because what if< if the market continues to go against if the market continues to go against your< your position and then you suffer a your position and then you suffer a bigger< bigger loss than you should so again bigger loss than you should so again once<

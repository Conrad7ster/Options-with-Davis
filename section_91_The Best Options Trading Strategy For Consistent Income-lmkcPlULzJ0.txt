### The Best Options Trading Strategy For Consistent Income-lmkcPlULzJ0
=======================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're gonna be talking about the best we're gonna be talking about the best option< option strategy for generating a option strategy for generating a consistent< consistent income and I know a lot of consistent income and I know a lot of you< you are going to be interested in this you are going to be interested in this because< because I've got a lot of people because I've got a lot of people reaching< reaching out to me to ask me you know reaching out to me to ask me you know Davis< Davis what is the best option strategy Davis what is the best option strategy that< that they can use to generate a that they can use to generate a consistent< consistent income right so in my opinion consistent income right so in my opinion the< the best strategy that can help you with the best strategy that can help you with a< a consistent income is none other than a consistent income is none other than the< the short strangle so what is the short the short strangle so what is the short strangle< strangle right so the short strangle is strangle right so the short strangle is a< a neutral option strategy with the a neutral option strategy with the combination< combination of a shot put and a short combination of a shot put and a short call< call all right so if you already been call all right so if you already been used< used to selling shot put options well used to selling shot put options well then< then the short strangers basically just then the short strangers basically just selling< selling an additional call option on top selling an additional call option on top of< of that right because when you do it of that right because when you do it this< this way basically you are also helping this way basically you are also helping with< with the downside risk for example if with the downside risk for example if you< you sell a put option and the market you sell a put option and the market happens< happens to tank right it goes past your happens to tank right it goes past your shot< shot put now if you only had the shot shot put now if you only had the shot put< put option then your losses can be you put option then your losses can be you know< know pretty big but if you were to just know pretty big but if you were to just sell< sell an additional call on top of your sell an additional call on top of your put< put option now this becomes a strangle put option now this becomes a strangle now< now what happens is that now you're lost now what happens is that now you're lost to< to the downside is slightly mitigated to the downside is slightly mitigated right< right because you receive a credit for right because you receive a credit for this< this and as you know the market cannot this and as you know the market cannot be< be at both sides at one time right it be at both sides at one time right it can< can only be at one side so when you add can only be at one side so when you add a< a shortcut on top of the short put what a shortcut on top of the short put what you< you have done now is that you have added you have done now is that you have added more< more credit to this strategy at the same more credit to this strategy at the same time< time you know you also are reducing the time you know you also are reducing the loss< loss in case if the market goes past loss in case if the market goes past your< your shot put option now this is what your shot put option now this is what you< you call an undefined risk option so you call an undefined risk option so with< with an undefined risk option with an undefined risk option theoretically< theoretically the loss is unlimited but theoretically the loss is unlimited but practically< practically that is not really going to practically that is not really going to happen< happen all right so and I'm going to happen all right so and I'm going to explain< explain a little bit more later on explain a little bit more later on so< so if you're a little bit more bullish so if you're a little bit more bullish you< you can actually adjust the strikes up you can actually adjust the strikes up right< right you can shift the whole strangle right you can shift the whole strangle upwards< upwards so if you think that the market upwards so if you think that the market is< is going to go a little bit higher then is going to go a little bit higher then you< you can adjust it this way or if you're you can adjust it this way or if you're a< a little bit more bearish then you can a little bit more bearish then you can adjust< adjust your strangle down as well so adjust your strangle down as well so this< this way you know it doesn't have to be this way you know it doesn't have to be just< just a neutral strategy right it can be just a neutral strategy right it can be slightly< slightly bullish so neutral to bullish slightly bullish so neutral to bullish or< or neutral to bearish now you might be or neutral to bearish now you might be wondering< wondering why do I consider this the wondering why do I consider this the best< best option strategy to generate a best option strategy to generate a consistent< consistent income well there are a few consistent income well there are a few reasons< reasons and the first is that it has the reasons and the first is that it has the purest< purest form of theta Decay because purest form of theta Decay because there's< there's no long options right as you can there's no long options right as you can see< see these are just two shot options so see these are just two shot options so when< when you have two shot options all you when you have two shot options all you have< have is just positive Theta right you have is just positive Theta right you have< have Theta Decay working for you every have Theta Decay working for you every single< single day but if you have long options single day but if you have long options let's< let's say for example you know the iron let's say for example you know the iron Condor< Condor so the iron Condor is basically Condor so the iron Condor is basically similar< similar you have the shot put and the similar you have the shot put and the short< short call but then you will buy the short call but then you will buy the wings< wings right you have the protection so wings right you have the protection so on< on the top side you buy a further all on the top side you buy a further all the< the money call option and at the bottom the money call option and at the bottom side< side you will buy a further output side you will buy a further output option< option so in this way sort of your option so in this way sort of your maximum< maximum loss is kept to this Wings the maximum loss is kept to this Wings the width< width of this Wings down here so the width of this Wings down here so the problem< problem with this is that when you have problem with this is that when you have the< the long options on right now you are the long options on right now you are actually< actually losing Theta right every single actually losing Theta right every single day< day so although you are making in terms day so although you are making in terms of< of the Theta Decay on your shot options of the Theta Decay on your shot options you're< you're losing on the long option so they you're losing on the long option so they will< will sort of have this kind of a will sort of have this kind of a friction< friction and they can reduce the maximum friction and they can reduce the maximum amount< amount of theta that you can receive amount of theta that you can receive right< right so it won't be as effective in right so it won't be as effective in terms< terms of theta Decay compared to the terms of theta Decay compared to the short< short strangle now the next reason is short strangle now the next reason is that< that this is the best way to trade the that this is the best way to trade the expected< expected move right if you're not sure expected move right if you're not sure what< what the expected move is I already have what the expected move is I already have a< a video on it which is what I call the a video on it which is what I call the number< number one secret to generating a number one secret to generating a consistent< consistent income even watch that go to consistent income even watch that go to my< my channel look for the video right so a my channel look for the video right so a 16< 16 Delta strangle has a theoretical wind 16 Delta strangle has a theoretical wind of< of 68 but in actual trades it has a of 68 but in actual trades it has a higher< higher win rate right and that's because higher win rate right and that's because the< the implied volatility is always higher the implied volatility is always higher than< than the realized volatility right it's than the realized volatility right it's always< always overstated so in a sense what it always overstated so in a sense what it means< means is that you are actually selling a means is that you are actually selling a richer< richer premium you're getting higher richer premium you're getting higher premiums< premiums than you theoretically should premiums than you theoretically should so< so the tasty trade team has already done so the tasty trade team has already done a< a lot of research into this so as you a lot of research into this so as. you can< can see down here this is a table of the can see down here this is a table of the spiders< spiders which is the index ETF right so spiders which is the index ETF right so basically< basically you can see that the average basically you can see that the average expected< expected move is always much greater expected move is always much greater than< than the realized move right so than the realized move right so regardless< regardless of the volatility right you regardless of the volatility right you can< can see that the IV rank down here on can see that the IV rank down here on the< the left hand side right it can be low the left hand side right it can be low it< it can be high in all instances you can it can be high in all instances you can see< see that the expected move is always see that the expected move is always overstated< overstated right it's always much more overstated right it's always much more than< than the relaxed move so you're always than the relaxed move so you're always receiving< receiving the premiums in terms based on receiving the premiums in terms based on the< the implied volatility right based on the implied volatility right based on the< the expected move but in actual fact the the expected move but in actual fact the movement< movement is actually much lesser so you movement is actually much lesser so you can< can see that the expect move is created can see that the expect move is created in< in all different volatility conditions in all different volatility conditions just< just that when you have a higher just that when you have a higher volatility< volatility condition right basically you volatility condition right basically you have< have a higher Edge you have a bigger have a higher Edge you have a bigger Edge< Edge you can see down here the Edge you can see down here the difference< difference between the expected move and difference between the expected move and the< the realized move when the ivy rank is the realized move when the ivy rank is very< very high you can see that it's ten very high you can see that it's ten dollars< dollars right more than ten dollars but dollars right more than ten dollars but as< as it goes all the way to the other end as it goes all the way to the other end you< you can see the difference becomes you can see the difference becomes slightly< slightly lesser but the key thing to slightly lesser but the key thing to note< note is that in all cases expected move note is that in all cases expected move is< is always more than realized move and is always more than realized move and that< that is not just for the spiders right that is not just for the spiders right they< they also did the studies for the iwm they also did the studies for the iwm which< which is also another index ETF as well which is also another index ETF as well as< as the qqqs so they did another in-depth as the qqqs so they did another in-depth study< study to see you know how often does the study to see you know how often does the bridge< bridge occurs right on either side of bridge occurs right on either side of the< the strangle right so as you can see the strangle right so as you can see down< down here the expected bridge should be down here the expected bridge should be 16< 16 on the 16 Delta strangle right so it 16 on the 16 Delta strangle right so it should< should be 16 it bridge on the put side should be 16 it bridge on the put side and< and the call side but in reality right and the call side but in reality right you< you can see that it actually breaches you can see that it actually breaches much< much less than that in fact on the put much less than that in fact on the put side< side you only breaches six percent of side you only breaches six percent of time< time or the call side only 12 percent of time or the call side only 12 percent of time< time and it's the same across all the time and it's the same across all the other< other Deltas as well 10 Deltas as well other Deltas as well 10 Deltas as well as< as 30 Deltas so what you'll notice is as 30 Deltas so what you'll notice is that< that the bridge tends to be more often that the bridge tends to be more often on< on the call side on the upper side and on the call side on the upper side and the< the only reason is because well we have the only reason is because well we have been< been in a bull market for the longest been in a bull market for the longest time< time right the stock market ever since time right the stock market ever since the< the index ETF has been created yes just the index ETF has been created yes just kept< kept going higher and higher and highest kept going higher and higher and highest that< that is why over time the bridge tends that is why over time the bridge tends to< to be more often on the call side right to be more often on the call side right but< but overall you can see that it's still but overall you can see that it's still much< much lesser than the theoretical much lesser than the theoretical expected< expected move right so the next thing to expected move right so the next thing to understand< understand is the strangles outliers understand is the strangles outliers right< right because when we are trading such right because when we are trading such kind< kind of strategies which is the kind of strategies which is the undefined< undefined kind where the loss undefined kind where the loss theoretically< theoretically can be unlimited right as theoretically can be unlimited right as you< you can see down here you can see that you can see down here you can see that it< it says minus infinity because on the it says minus infinity because on the call< call side the stock or the index ETF can call side the stock or the index ETF can pretty< pretty much just go all the way up pretty much just go all the way up nonstop< nonstop up right so that is why nonstop up right so that is why theoretically< theoretically the max loss is infinity theoretically the max loss is infinity but< but practically that's very unlikely to but practically that's very unlikely to happen< happen in fact they also did a lot of happen in fact they also did a lot of studies< studies as you can see down here to see studies as you can see down here to see what< what is the chances of them losing which what is the chances of them losing which is< is more than the buying power reduction is more than the buying power reduction so< so what is the buying power reduction so what is the buying power reduction right< right the buying power reduction right right the buying power reduction right basically< basically is in this green box down here basically is in this green box down here basically< basically it is the amount of money that basically it is the amount of money that you< you have to put up for uh putting on you have to put up for uh putting on this< this strangle position so you can see this strangle position so you can see down< down here at every IV level the buying down here at every IV level the buying power< power reduction encompassed nearly all power reduction encompassed nearly all losses< losses for early managed contracts losses for early managed contracts therefore< therefore the total amount of Capital At therefore the total amount of Capital At Risk< Risk is roughly kept by the total Risk is roughly kept by the total portfolio< portfolio buying power allocated which portfolio buying power allocated which means< means to say most of the time in fact means to say most of the time in fact majority< majority of the time if not all the majority of the time if not all the times< times this will be in effect the max times this will be in effect the max that< that you can ever lose although it says that you can ever lose although it says down< down here this is the max loss which is down here this is the max loss which is minus< minus infinity this will Encompass most minus infinity this will Encompass most of< of the outlier risk which you should of the outlier risk which you should have< have which means to say if you put on a have which means to say if you put on a strangle< strangle you already know up front what strangle you already know up front what could< could be the worst possible case right could be the worst possible case right what's< what's the worst possible loss that you what's the worst possible loss that you could< could experience and as you can see down could experience and as you can see down here< here based on this table you can see the here based on this table you can see the probability< probability of loss exceeding this probability of loss exceeding this buying< buying power reduction and you can see buying power reduction and you can see it's< it's pretty much almost close to zero it's pretty much almost close to zero percent< percent right especially if you are percent right especially if you are trading< trading in the higher volatilities so if trading in the higher volatilities so if you< you were to just focus on just this you were to just focus on just this table< table based on the 16 Delta you can see table based on the 16 Delta you can see that< that the probability of it exceeding that the probability of it exceeding this< this number down here is zero percent if this number down here is zero percent if the< the IV is from 20 to all the way above the IV is from 20 to all the way above 40< 40 right and then only 0 to 20 is only 40 right and then only 0 to 20 is only 0. 1< 0.

1 percent that means the chances of 0. 1 percent that means the chances of you< you actually making such a huge loss you actually making such a huge loss right< right which is like minus infinity is right which is like minus infinity is not< not high at all so this is all good but not high at all so this is all good but it's< it's all just Theory so how does this it's all just Theory so how does this pan< pan out when you actually trade it out pan out when you actually trade it out in< in reality right in in actual trading in reality right in in actual trading environment< environment by the way if you like this environment by the way if you like this video< video so far Please Subscribe and also video. so far Please Subscribe and also click< click the thumbs up button and also do click the thumbs up button and also do get< get your free copy of the options income get your free copy of the options income blueprint< blueprint where I share the top three blueprint where I share the top three option< option strategies that help you generate option strategies that help you generate a< a consistent income each month trading a consistent income each month trading just< just one to two hours a day right so if just one to two hours a day right so if you< you want to go ahead to get this copy you want to go ahead to get this copy just< just head on over to just head on over to optionswithdavis.

com blueprint or right back< back to the video so what I've done down back to the video so what I've done down here< here is I've shared with you the last here is I've shared with you the last 100< 100 tricks which I've put on in terms of 100 tricks which I've put on in terms of the< the strangle so as you can see down here the strangle so as you can see down here there< there are winners and losses and you can there are winners and losses and you can see< see that overall these are the steps see that overall these are the steps right< right I try to squeeze everything into right I try to squeeze everything into this< this uh this table down here but as you this uh this table down here but as you can< can see it's it's just a little bit too can see it's it's just a little bit too big< big all right so I just gave the big all right so I just gave the essential< essential details down here so you can essential details down here so you can see< see down here the win rate is 77 which see down here the win rate is 77 which is< is very consistent with the fact that is very consistent with the fact that the< the win rate is always higher than the the win rate is always higher than the theoretical< theoretical 68 right so the loss rate is theoretical 68 right so the loss rate is only< only 23 and you can see down here the only 23 and you can see down here the average< average win is 269 dollars and the average win is 269 dollars and the average< average loss is negative 203 dollars average loss is negative 203 dollars right< right which is very good right most of right which is very good right most of the< the time if you get average win that's the time if you get average win that's higher< higher than average loss and you have a higher than average loss and you have a win< win rate that's higher you know that you win rate that's higher you know that you have< have a winning strategy on hand right have a winning strategy on hand right the< the biggest win is 785 and the biggest the biggest win is 785 and the biggest loss< loss is minus 449 dollars so as you can loss is minus 449 dollars so as you can see< see down here while there are losses and see down here while there are losses and they< they are losing streaks you can see down they are losing streaks you can see down here< here is a losing streak about six losses here is a losing streak about six losses overall< overall this is still in a profit right overall this is still in a profit right so< so you can see down here I've calculated so you can see down here I've calculated out< out the expectancy out the expectancy right< right which is a hundred and sixty right which is a hundred and sixty dollars< dollars 44 cents which means on average dollars 44 cents which means on average when< when I put on this trade over the long when I put on this trade over the long run< run you know I expect to make about 160 run you know I expect to make about 160 dollars< dollars uh per trade on average so the dollars uh per trade on average so the buying< buying power effect the buying power buying power effect the buying power reduction< reduction is roughly around 2 500 odd reduction is roughly around 2 500 odd right< right so that should be the max risk right so that should be the max risk that< that I should expect to hit right but as that I should expect to hit right but as you< you can see in all these cases I'm not you can see in all these cases I'm not even< even near that number right you can see even near that number right you can see that< that the biggest loss is only 449 that the biggest loss is only 449 dollars< dollars but the buying power effect is dollars but the buying power effect is about< about 2 500 odd so you can see if you go about 2 500 odd so you can see if you go back< back to this table down here this table back to this table down here this table down< down here is pretty accurate because I down here is pretty accurate because I do< do not have any losses that's anywhere do not have any losses that's anywhere near< near this buying power effect now of near this buying power effect now of course< course it's not to say that it won't course it's not to say that it won't happen< happen but it can happen as well but happen but it can happen as well but this< this is what you need to take note of so this is what you need to take note of so whenever< whenever we're trading such kind of whenever we're trading such kind of short< short strangle trades especially is short strangle trades especially is undefined< undefined the most important thing that undefined the most important thing that you< you need to take note of is how to you need to take note of is how to manage< manage your risk because there's always manage your risk because there's always the< the charge answers of you wiping out the the charge answers of you wiping out the account< account if you do not manage it properly account if you do not manage it properly so< so here are four ways to reduce huge so here are four ways to reduce huge losses< losses when you're trading such kind of losses when you're trading such kind of strategies< strategies like this strangle all right strategies like this strangle all right so< so the very first way is to ensure that so the very first way is to ensure that the< the buying power reduction is a maximum the buying power reduction is a maximum of< of five percent up to seven percent of of five percent up to seven percent of your< your Capital right so for example if you your Capital right so for example if you see< see that the buying power reduction of see that the buying power reduction of the< the trade is two thousand five hundred the trade is two thousand five hundred dollars< dollars and then your trading account is dollars and then your trading account is let's< let's say 25 000 so the question for you let's say 25 000 so the question for you is< is do you think you can put on this is do you think you can put on this trade trade trade well< well the answer is no because this takes well the answer is no because this takes up< up 10 of your whole trading account up 10 of your whole trading account right< right that means in the if event whereby right that means in the if event whereby you< you actually hit the specs loss you're you actually hit the specs loss you're going< going to hit a 10 to your account so going to hit a 10 to your account so what< what you do in this situation well you what you do in this situation well you simply< simply do not trade this uh stock or simply do not trade this uh stock or this< this index ETF instead you go and find this index ETF instead you go and find another< another underline that has a smaller another underline that has a smaller buying< buying power effect for the strangle so buying power effect for the strangle so what< what you're looking at is maybe what you're looking at. is maybe something< something like a thousand two hundred something like a thousand two hundred and< and fifty dollars so if you're able to and fifty dollars so if you're able to find< find a stock and you put up the strangle find a stock and you put up the strangle and< and it's a thousand two hundred fifty and it's a thousand two hundred fifty dollars< dollars in terms of the buying power dollars in terms of the buying power reduction< reduction then you can put on the trade reduction then you can put on the trade otherwise< otherwise if it's more than that it's otherwise if it's more than that it's going< going to be too big for your account going to be too big for your account size size size now< now next never take your trip past the now next never take your trip past the 21< 21 days to expiration mark because 21 days to expiration mark because that's< that's the time where the trade can that's the time where the trade can start< start to have massive losses right it start to have massive losses right it could< could get into a very big loss if you go could get into a very big loss if you go all< all the way close to expiration so that all the way close to expiration so that is< is why you know as much as possible is why you know as much as possible never< never take a trip past the 21 days to never take a trip past the 21 days to expiration< expiration even if it's a loss at that expiration even if it's a loss at that point< point you can choose to manage it if you point you can choose to manage it if you want< want or you can just take a loss and put want or you can just take a loss and put on< on the next trade remember this is all on the next trade remember this is all probability< probability game you can see down here probability game you can see down here I've< I've just taken a loss when it's a loss I've just taken a loss when it's a loss right< right sometimes I manage it sometimes I right sometimes I manage it sometimes I don't< don't manage it so at the end of the day don't manage it so at the end of the day as< as long as it reaches 21 days to as long as it reaches 21 days to expiration< expiration you want to do something expiration you want to do something never< never take it to expiration now the never take it to expiration now the third< third thing to do to reduce your huge third thing to do to reduce your huge loss< loss is to trade index ETS instead of loss is to trade index ETS instead of individual< individual stocks well because you can individual stocks well because you can firstly< firstly continuously put on this firstly continuously put on this strangle< strangle if you want right because there strangle if you want right because there are< are no earnings right with no earnings are no earnings right with no earnings you< you can keep trading the index ETFs you can keep trading the index ETFs secondly< secondly you do not get exposed to all secondly you do not get exposed to all these< these individual stock news right these individual stock news right because< because when a stock or company just because when a stock or company just released< released some started news it can really released some started news it can really affect< affect the the prices right for example affect the the prices right for example if< if the stock certainly or the company uh if the stock certainly or the company uh has< has a product launch that didn't do well has a product launch that didn't do well or< or the movie didn't do well or for or the movie didn't do well or for example< example Google right they have this uh example Google right they have this uh AI< AI which they release and there's some AI which they release and there's some mistake< mistake in one of the answers all of a mistake in one of the answers all of a sudden< sudden the stock started to tank right sudden the stock started to tank right so< so if you want to have more consistency so if you want to have more consistency in< in your result especially when you're in your result especially when you're trading< trading such kind of undefined risk trading such kind of undefined risk strategies< strategies go more with index ETFs and strategies go more with index ETFs and finally< finally you want to spread out your finally you want to spread out your trades< trades across four things you want to trades across four things you want to spread< spread out against time that means you spread out against time that means you put< put on at different dates right you put on at different dates right you don't< don't put it all on the same day you're don't put it all on the same day you're gonna< gonna put a different price level so as gonna put a different price level so as the< the price goes up you put some price the price goes up you put some price goes< goes down you put some again and then goes down you put some again and then you< you also want to diversify by different you also want to diversify by different strikes< strikes right you you do not want to put strikes right you you do not want to put it< it all across the same type of strikes it all across the same type of strikes and< and you want to have different and you want to have different expiration< expiration there so when you do it all expiration there so when you do it all this< this basically what you're doing is that this basically what you're doing is that you< you are really spreading out the your you are really spreading out the your risk< risk right so one strangle might be risk right so one strangle might be profitable< profitable another might be a loss and profitable another might be a loss and another< another one might be a big winner one another one might be a big winner one might< might be another small loss so at the might be another small loss so at the end< end of the day this will all sort of end of the day this will all sort of like< like smoothen your p l volatility and like smoothen your p l volatility and this< this is basically how you can reduce this is basically how you can reduce your< your huge losses so basically these are your huge losses so basically these are the< the four ways that you must really the four ways that you must really follow< follow right especially if you do not follow right especially if you do not want< want to incur such huge losses when want to incur such huge losses when trading< trading the strangle all right guys trading the strangle all right guys that's< that's it for this video and I hope you that's it for this video and I hope you found< found this video helpful and if you like found this video helpful and if you like this< this video please give me a thumbs up this video please give me a thumbs up and< and also subscribe to my channel as well and also subscribe to my channel as well this<

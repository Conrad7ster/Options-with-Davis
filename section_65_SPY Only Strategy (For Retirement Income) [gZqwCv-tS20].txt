===========================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you a spy I'm going to be sharing with you a spy strategy< strategy so this strategy mainly strategy so this strategy mainly specifically< specifically to trade on spy and I do specifically to trade on spy and I do think< think it's a pretty simple strategy to think it's a pretty simple strategy to set< set up as well at least in my opinion so set up as well at least in my opinion so if< if you are new to trading options you if you are new to trading options you can< can certainly trade this strategy as can certainly trade this strategy as well< well now whenever I trade any strategy well now whenever I trade any strategy either< either I try and find the right underly either I try and find the right underly that< that suits this strategy or I try and that suits this strategy or I try and Design< Design This strategy around the Design This strategy around the underlying< underlying that I want to trade so it underlying that I want to trade so it will< will be this case for this video so will be this case for this video so basically< basically we have already decided to basically we have already decided to choose< choose spy as an underlying so now we choose spy as an underlying so now we want< want to design a strategy just want to design a strategy just specifically< specifically for spy so how do we do specifically for spy so how do we do that< that so first of all we need to First that so first of all we need to First understand< understand what is the nature of spy understand what is the nature of spy right< right we want to understand a little bit right we want to understand a little bit more< more of our underlying before we can more of our underlying before we can construct< construct a strategy around it so to me construct a strategy around it so to me spy< spy is basically what is called a spy is basically what is called a positive< positive drift underlying right so positive drift underlying right so positive< positive drift basically just means that positive drift basically just means that the< the market wants to go up over time so the market wants to go up over time so now< now that we know that spy is a positive now that we know that spy is a positive drift< drift underlying we want to design our drift underlying we want to design our strategy< strategy that really takes advantage of strategy that really takes advantage of this< this positive drift so what kind of this positive drift so what kind of strategy< strategy will do well with spy so strategy will do well with spy so generally< generally the strategies that will do generally the strategies that will do well< well would be those bullish strategies well would be those bullish strategies right< right generally bullish strategies tend right generally bullish strategies tend to< to do well over time but at the same to do well over time but at the same time< time we also want to construct a time we also want to construct a strategy< strategy where it's not entirely bullish strategy where it's not entirely bullish. where< where it's also neutral because not all where it's also neutral because not all the< the time the market will always be going the time the market will always be going up< up right there time the market stays up right there time the market stays still< still and even dips a little bit before still and even dips a little bit before it< it goes up higher again so we're going it goes up higher again so we're going to< to design a strategy around this to design a strategy around this characteristic< characteristic of spy so first of all characteristic of spy so first of all let's< let's go to the option chain so the very let's go to the option chain so the very first< first thing we want to do is select the first thing we want to do is select the DTE< DTE right so if you have been a follower DTE right so if you have been a follower of< of my channel by now you know that I of my channel by now you know that I like< like to go somewhere around 45 days to like to go somewhere around 45 days to expiration< expiration right so in this case is expiration right so in this case is around< around the April 20th Which is closest around the April 20th Which is closest to< to 45 days because it's 53 right I like to 45 days because it's 53 right I like to< to go above 45 rather than below 45 to go above 45 rather than below 45 because< because that's where our Edge lies so because that's where our Edge lies so for< for this example I'm going to choose the for this example I'm going to choose the April< April 20th so what kind of strategy can April 20th so what kind of strategy can we< we put on that can really take advantage we put on that can really take advantage of< of this positive drift well the very of this positive drift well the very first< first and most simple strategy will be first and most simple strategy will be What's< What's called the short putut now before What's called the short putut now before I< I go any further just want to let you I go any further just want to let you know< know that we are just going to trade the know that we are just going to trade the short< short put right we're going to trade the short put right we're going to trade the short< short putut in combination with another short putut in combination with another strategy< strategy right so first off we want to strategy right so first off we want to select< select the short putut for the strategy select the short putut for the strategy so< so what is the strike so generally when so what is the strike so generally when we< we are trying to select the strikes the we are trying to select the strikes the way< way we want to go around it is to way we want to go around it is to position< position our strikes around the Delta position our strikes around the Delta right< right so as you can see down here I've right so as you can see down here I've already< already got the Delta column down here already got the Delta column down here so< so you can see it ranges from 0. 13 and so you can see it ranges from 0.

13 and it< it goes all the way up to 0. 44 which is it goes all the way up to 0.

44 which is around< around where at the market is Right around where at the market is Right basically< basically this is where the current basically this is where the current market< market price is around 5005 market price is around 5005 56< 56 so when we choosing the short putut 56 so when we choosing the short putut generally< generally I like to go for somewhere generally I like to go for somewhere around< around the expected move range so what around the expected move range so what is< is the expected move range the expected is the expected move range the expected move< move range is somewhere around 16 Deltas move range is somewhere around 16 Deltas right< right 16 to 20 Deltas thereabouts right right 16 to 20 Deltas thereabouts right so< so for this example let us choose the 20 so for this example let us choose the. 20 Delta< Delta so when you put on a shut at Delta so when you put on a shut at around< around 20 Delta naturally you will have around 20 Delta naturally you will have a< a win rate of roughly around 80% so how a win rate of roughly around 80% so how do< do we know that it's around 80% well do we know that it's around 80% well simply< simply it's because this Delta down here simply it's because this Delta down here is< is also an indication of what is the is also an indication of what is the probability< probability of this strike down here for probability of this strike down here for it< it saying being in the money at it saying being in the money at expiration< expiration right so if there's a 20 expiration right so if there's a 20 Delta< Delta right 0. 20 just means 20 Delta Delta right 0.

20 just means 20 Delta because< because each option controls 100 shares because each option controls 100 shares so< so if it says 20 Delta it just means so if it says 20 Delta it just means there< there is a 20% chance roughly of it there is a 20% chance roughly of it being< being in the money at expiration and as being in the money at expiration and as you< you know if the trade is in the money you know if the trade is in the money basically< basically if it's below this strike down basically if it's below this strike down here< here then you know it's roughly going to here then you know it's roughly going to be< be a loss so in this case we can run up be a loss so in this case we can run up to< to about 3 to about 3 in< in terms of our premium so how do you in terms of our premium so how do you know< know if it's going to be a loss we know know if it's going to be a loss we know it's< it's going to be a loss if it goes $3 it's going to be a loss if it goes $3 below< below 487 right which is going to be 484 below 487 right which is going to be 484 so< so anything below 484 we're going to so anything below 484 we're going to start< start to see a loss all right so this is start to see a loss all right so this is the< the short putut part of the strategy now the short putut part of the strategy now you< you might be thinking hey Davis but what you might be thinking hey Davis but what if< if I put on the short putut and the if I put on the short putut and the market< market starts to go down right the market starts to go down right the market< market starts to tank well in that case market starts to tank well in that case we< we also want to put on another strategy we also want to put on another strategy to< to also help you know in case the market to also help you know in case the market goes< goes down the moment you put it on and goes down the moment you put it on and what< what is that strategy that strategy is what is that strategy that strategy is where< where we go to the call site and we want where we go to the call site and we want to< to put on the call Credit spread so as to put on the call Credit spread so as you< you know the call Credit spread is a you know the call Credit spread is a bearish< bearish strategy so that means you want bearish strategy so that means you want the< the market to go down so here we have the market to go down so here we have something< something pretty beautiful right because something pretty beautiful right because we< we have a short putut strategy whereby we have a short putut strategy whereby we< we generally want the market to go up we generally want the market to go up and< and then we have a call Credit spread and then we have a call Credit spread where< where we want the market to go down as where we want the market to go down as well< well so we have a combination of this well so we have a combination of this two< two strategy a bullish and a bearish two strategy a bullish and a bearish strategy< strategy to make up this strategy now strategy to make up this strategy now the< the question is how do you actually the question is how do you actually construct< construct your call Credit spread so construct your call Credit spread so again< again this is where we want to go to see again this is where we want to go to see our< our Delta column so generally for the our Delta column so generally for the call< call Credit spread side we want to go call Credit spread side we want to go for< for somewhere around say 30 Deltas right for somewhere around say 30 Deltas right 30< 30 Deltas so in this case I'll go for 30 Deltas so in this case I'll go for the< the one at 31 Deltas which is you know the one at 31 Deltas which is you know pretty< pretty close to 30 so the question now pretty close to 30 so the question now is< is how wide should our call credit is how wide should our call credit spread< spread B so remember we already said spread B so remember we already said that< that this spy is a positive drift that this spy is a positive drift vehicle< vehicle that means the market wants to vehicle that means the market wants to go< go up over time so it serves us to only go up over time so it serves us to only design< design a strategy where there is no risk design a strategy where there is no risk to< to the upside right we don't want to to the upside right we don't. want to construct< construct a strategy whereby you know construct a strategy whereby you know for< for the Spy if the market keeps going up for the Spy if the market keeps going up then< then we're going to lose money right then we're going to lose money right there's< there's no point because we already know there's no point because we already know the< the market wants to go up over time for the market wants to go up over time for spy< spy so that means we want to craft a spy so that means we want to craft a call< call Credit spread with whereby the call Credit spread with whereby the overall< overall strategy will still be overall strategy will still be profitable< profitable if the market goes up right profitable if the market goes up right so< so how do we do that so to do that the so how do we do that so to do that the most< most important thing is to construct a most important thing is to construct a call< call Credit spread whereby the width is call Credit spread whereby the width is smaller< smaller than the overall credit that we smaller than the overall credit that we receive< receive right so here's what I mean so receive right so here's what I mean so let's< let's say for example if we construct a let's say for example if we construct a call< call Credit spread that is $3 wide we call Credit spread that is $3 wide we need< need to have a premium that is more than need to have a premium that is more than $3< $3 so as you can see over here it says $3 so as you can see over here it says that< that the premium is $381 that the premium is $381 right< right basically what it means is that right basically what it means is that you'll< you'll be collecting $381 for every of you'll be collecting $381 for every of the< the strategy that you put on so the strategy that you put on so $381< $381 and your call Credit spread is $3 $381 and your call Credit spread is $3 by< by what does that mean remember the call by what does that mean remember the call Credit< Credit spread what is the maximum risk Credit spread what is the maximum risk of< of that the maximum risk of the call of that the maximum risk of the call Credit< Credit spread is basically the width of Credit spread is basically the width of the< the spread so if the width of the spread the spread so if the width of the spread is< is $3 that means the max loss is $3 or is $3 that means the max loss is $3 or $300< $300 per spread right so in this case $300 per spread right so in this case let's< let's say if you lose $3 the market goes let's say if you lose $3 the market goes up< up guess what you have a total of up guess what you have a total of $381< $381 which means there a spillover of $381 which means there a spillover of 81< 81 that means if the market goes all the 81 that means if the market goes all the way< way up it R is past 523 even goes all way up it R is past 523 even goes all the< the way to the way to 550< 550 even you're still going to be in a 550 even you're still going to be in a profit< profit right so if you want to be sure profit right so if you want to be sure all< all you got to do is go and take a look all you got to do is go and take a look at< at the p&amp;l graph right so let me just at the p&amp;l graph right so let me just show< show you the p&amp;l graph down here so as show you the p&amp;l graph down here so as you< you can see this is the p&amp;l graph of you can see this is the p&amp;l graph of this< this strategy so what is this strategy this strategy so what is this strategy called< called this this strategy is called the called this this strategy is called the Jade< Jade lizard by the way if you like this Jade lizard by the way if you like this video< video so far Please Subscribe and

com blueprint all right back to< to the video so the J lizard is a to the video so the J lizard is a combination< combination of two credit strategies combination of two credit strategies right< right two premium selling strategies you right two premium selling strategies you have< have a short putut and then you have a have a short putut and then you have a call< call Credit spread so as you can see call Credit spread so as you can see down< down here this red color line is where down here this red color line is where the< the current market price is now if the the current market price is now if the market< market goes all the way up right so the market goes all the way up right so the price< price line is below right as you can see price line is below right as you can see on< on the left hand side this is 4555 on on the left hand side this is 4555 on the< the right hand side this is 557 so if the right hand side this is 557 so if the< the market was to go all the way up from the market was to go all the way up from where< where the current market price is so where the current market price is so let's< let's say for example it goes here then let's say for example it goes here then guess< guess what you do not have to worry guess what you do not have to worry because< because you still get a profit and if because you still get a profit and if the< the market actually stays within this the market actually stays within this Zone< Zone down here from here all the way to Zone down here from here all the way to here< here then you're going to actually here then you're going to actually realize< realize the max profit if you hold all realize the max profit if you hold all the< the way to expiration so this is the the way to expiration so this is the beauty< beauty of this strategy right because beauty of this strategy right because you< you have a bullish strategy on one side you have a bullish strategy on one side you< you have a bearish strategy on one side you have a bearish strategy on one side so< so if the market doesn't keep going up so if the market doesn't keep going up right< right basically there will be times right basically there will be times where< where there's going to be retracements where there's going to be retracements there'll< there'll be times where there's going to there'll be times where there's going to be< be reversal as well this call Credit be reversal as well this call Credit spread< spread side is really going to come in spread side is really going to come in to< to help cushion the impact of the loss to help cushion the impact of the loss on< on the short putut side now of course if on the short putut side now of course if the< the market keeps going all the way down the market keeps going all the way down there< there will reach a point where you will there will reach a point where you will get< get into a loss and that is the risk of get into a loss and that is the risk of any< any strategy right so again we design any strategy right so again we design this< this strategy because spy generally is a this strategy because spy generally is a positive< positive drift vehicle where it wants to positive drift vehicle where it wants to keep< keep going up over time right so in a keep going up over time right so in a general< general sense as long as the market general sense as long as the market keeps< keeps going up this strategy will start keeps going up this strategy will start to< to do well now this jet lizard what I to do well now this jet lizard what I like< like about it is that it's actually very like about it is that it's actually very flexible< flexible right so as you can see down flexible right so as you can see down here< here the credit you receive is here the credit you receive is $381< $381 so if the market let's say goes all $381 so if the market let's say goes all the< the way here and lands at this point at the way here and lands at this point at expiration< expiration let's say then you're just expiration let's say then you're just going< going to get the minimum profit right going to get the minimum profit right what< what is the minimum profit if you were what is the minimum profit if you were to< to just hover it it's going to be around to just hover it it's going to be around $81< $81 right basically right your $3 loss $81 right basically right your $3 loss from< from the $381 credit you received 81 now from the $381 credit you received 81 now what< what if you actually want to receive a what if you actually want to receive a little< little bit more if the market goes up little bit more if the market goes up well< well in this case you can simply just well in this case you can simply just adjust< adjust the call Credit spread that means adjust the call Credit spread that means to< to say you actually do not have to have to say you actually do not have to have a< a $3 wide spread instead you may want to a $3 wide spread instead you may want to have< have maybe just a $2 wides spread right have maybe just a $2 wides spread right if< if you have a $2 WID spread let us take if you have a $2 WID spread let us take a< a look at the p&amp;l graph now again let me a look at the p&amp;l graph now again let me just< just delete this drawing now as you can just delete this drawing now as you can see< see down here now if the market goes all see down here now if the market goes all the< the way up you have the way up you have $855< $855 and if the market stays within this $855 and if the market stays within this Max< Max profit Zone from this point down Max profit Zone from this point down here< here let me just get my marker from this here let me just get my marker from this point< point to this point point to this point then< then you're going to get the max profit then you're going to get the max profit of< of roughly around of roughly around $355< $355 so as you can see the J lizard is $355 so as you can see the J lizard is really< really a very versatile strategy and I really a very versatile strategy and I do< do like this strategy quite a lot now do like this strategy quite a lot now the< the next important thing you want to the next important thing you want to take< take a look at before you actually place take a look at before you actually place this< this strategy is to take a look at the this strategy is to take a look at the buying< buying power requirement remember this buying power requirement remember this is< is undefined risk strategy right because is. undefined risk strategy right because you< you have a short put on one end you need you have a short put on one end you need to< to see what is the BPR required put on to see what is the BPR required put on on< on this trade so because this is spy Spy on this trade so because this is spy Spy around around around $55< $55 it can be quite high so we just have $55 it can be quite high so we just have to< to take a look at what is the buying to take a look at what is the buying power< power effect so as you can see down here power effect so as you can see down here it< it says the buying power effect is it says the buying power effect is slightly< slightly over slightly over $8,000< $8,000 so needless to say if you don't $8,000 so needless to say if you don't have< have you know a pretty big account it's have you know a pretty big account it's very< very hard for you to put on this very hard for you to put on this strategy< strategy now what if your account size strategy now what if your account size is< is much smaller right maybe you have a is much smaller right maybe you have a $10,000< $10,000 account or maybe even a $5,000 $10,000 account or maybe even a $5,000 account< account then needless to say you cannot account then needless to say you cannot put< put on this strategy because it's just put on this strategy because it's just way< way too big so what is the solution well way too big so what is the solution well the< the solution is actually pretty simple the solution is actually pretty simple the< the solution is just to simply just put the solution is just to simply just put a< a long put at the bottom and Define this a long put at the bottom and Define this strategy< strategy right basically change it into strategy right basically change it into a< a defined risk strategy so instead of a defined risk strategy so instead of just< just having a short put down here what just having a short put down here what you< you want to do is add a long put as well you want to do is add a long put as well right< right you want to add a long put so now right you want to add a long put so now it< it becomes a defined R strategy so it's it becomes a defined R strategy so it's now< now a short putut spread and a short now a short putut spread and a short call< call spread all right so how do you call spread all right so how do you decide< decide where to put this uh long put at decide where to put this uh long put at right< right to Define your spread down here right to Define your spread down here well< well this comes down to your risk well this comes down to your risk allocation< allocation right what is the risk that allocation right what is the risk that you< you can actually have per trade right so you can actually have per trade right so let's< let's say for example your risk per let's say for example your risk per trade< trade is maybe $1,000 right so if it's trade is maybe $1,000 right so if it's $1,000< $1,000 then what you want to do is just $1,000 then what you want to do is just simply< simply go to 10 points y so 487 you go simply go to 10 points y so 487 you go all< all the way to all the way to 477< 477 right 477 right now what you have 477 right 477 right now what you have done< done is that you have limited the risk done is that you have limited the risk to< to the downside and now your buying to the downside and now your buying power< power effect is so much lower right you power effect is so much lower right you notice< notice your buying power effect right notice your buying power effect right now< now is only now is only $840< $840 because you have the credit as well $840 because you have the credit as well now< now we definitely want to adjust the now we definitely want to adjust the call< call Credit spread side as well because call Credit spread side as well because remember< remember we want this strategy to have remember we want this strategy to have no< no risk to the upside so as it stands no risk to the upside so as it stands there's< there's going to be some risk right so there's going to be some risk right so as< as you can see let me just bring up the as you can see let me just bring up the p&amp;l< p&amp;l graph so now you can see on the p&amp;l graph so now you can see on the right< right hand side right hand side there< there is going to be some risk right there is going to be some risk right although< although it's very minimal right you can although it's very minimal right you can see< see the risk is only $38 but if you want see the risk is only $38 but if you want to< to construct one whereby there's no risk to construct one whereby there's no risk to< to the upside which also means that you to the upside which also means that you have< have a very high win rate and by the way have a very high win rate and by the way the< the win rate for this strategy should be the win rate for this strategy should be around< around 80% because it's determined by around 80% because it's determined by where< where you place your short put strike at where you place your short put strike at right< right if your short put strike is around right if your short put strike is around 20< 20 Deltas then you know this whole 20 Deltas then you know this whole strategy< strategy should roughly have about an strategy should roughly have about an 80%< 80% win rate or so now how do you 80% win rate or so now how do you actually< actually change the strikes up for the actually change the strikes up for the call< call spread so that it has no risk call spread so that it has no risk remember< remember again the rule right you want remember again the rule right you want the< the call spread withd to be smaller than the call spread withd to be smaller than the< the overall credit that you receive so the overall credit that you receive so we< we have to change our call spread so we have to change our call spread so let's< let's go up here and what we got to do let's go up here and what we got to do right< right now is just maybe change this call right now is just maybe change this call spread< spread now we got to change it to one spread now we got to change it to one point< point white so one point white the max point white so one point white the max loss< loss on this call Credit spread is going loss on this call Credit spread is going to< to be a dollar and we have now received to be a dollar and we have now received $1. 34< $1.

34 which means to say we have covered $1. 34 which means to say we have covered the< the loss if it goes past this call the loss if it goes past this call Credit< Credit spread site so let us take a look Credit spread site so let us take a look at< at the p&amp;l graph again and as you can at the p&amp;l graph again and as you can see< see there is now no risk to the upside see there is now no risk to the upside so< so if the market goes all the way up so if the market goes all the way up we're< we're going to make at least still $34 we're going to make at least still $34 and< and if the market is going to stay and if the market is going to stay within< within this profit Zone which it can within this profit Zone which it can right< right quite a big portion of the time right quite a big portion of the time then< then we're going to make the max profit then we're going to make the max profit if< if it holds all the way to expiration if it holds all the way to expiration the< the max profit is going to be the max profit is going to be $834< $834 so this is what is called the Jon $834 so this is what is called the Jon Condo< Condo right so J Condor is basically a Condo right so J Condor is basically a term< term that I came up with I coined the term that I came up with I coined the strategy< strategy the Jade Condor mainly because strategy the Jade Condor mainly because it's< it's just the Define risk version of the it's just the Define risk version of the Jade< Jade lizard another way to call this Jade lizard another way to call this strategy< strategy is also the skewed iron Condor strategy is also the skewed iron Condor because< because it is an iron Condor because because it is an iron Condor because there's< there's the call spread and then you there's the call spread and then you also< also have the put spread just that the also have the put spread just that the call< call spread site is going to be so much call spread site is going to be so much smaller< smaller than the put site so the name is smaller than the put site so the name is not< not important what you need to not important what you need to understand< understand is how to construct this understand is how to construct this strategy< strategy especially according to your strategy especially according to your risk< risk allocation and also the idea of risk allocation and also the idea of this< this strategy right like I mentioned this strategy right like I mentioned already< already now for those of you who have an already now for those of you who have an even< even smaller account right let's say for even smaller account right let's say for example< example the max risk per trade you can example the max risk per trade you can have< have is $500 how are you going to have is $500 how are you going to construct< construct this strategy well it's going construct this strategy well it's going to< to be pretty similar as well right so to be pretty similar as well right so the< the very first thing what you want to do the very first thing what you want to do is< is reduce this width down here to how is reduce this width down here to how many< many points white guys you should know many points white guys you should know this< this by now if your max loss is going to this by now if your max loss is going to be< be 500 then you want to stretch this be 500 then you want to stretch this withd< withd to only about 5 Points wi so in withd to only about 5 Points wi so in this< this case 5 Points away from 487 is 482 this case 5 Points away from 487 is 482 now< now this is where you're going to have now this is where you're going to have to< to start to change your call Credit to start to change your call Credit spread< spread a little bit because you notice spread a little bit because you notice that< that your max credit right now is only that your max credit right now is only 90< 90 cents but you have already gone to 90 cents but you have already gone to the< the minimum width of the call Credit the minimum width of the call Credit spread< spread you notice your width is a dollar spread you notice your width is a dollar wide< wide you cannot go any smaller than that wide you cannot go any smaller than that right< right because the intervals for the Spy right because the intervals for the Spy is< is only $1 wide and if you were to take is only $1 wide and if you were to take a< a look at your p graph down here you a look at your p graph down here you notice< notice now it's a loss on the upside notice now it's a loss on the upside right< right if it goes past your call Credit right if it goes past your call Credit spread< spread so although the loss is minimum spread so although the loss is minimum it's< it's still a loss so how do we actually it's still a loss so how do we actually change< change this right so there are two ways change this right so there are two ways to< to do this right so you have to really to do this right so you have to really uh< uh take note down here the first. way is uh take note down here the first way is that< that we can shift this whole credit that we can shift this whole credit spread< spread towards closer to where the spread towards closer to where the market< market price is why because when we market price is why because when we shift< shift the call Credit spread closer to shift the call Credit spread closer to where< where the market price is your call where the market price is your call credit< credit spread it's going to be worth credit spread it's going to be worth more< more right if it's going to worth more more right if it's going to worth more it's< it's going to contribute to the overall it's going to contribute to the overall credit< credit of this strategy so let's say for credit of this strategy so let's say for example< example let's go to the one at around 41 example let's go to the one at around 41 Deltas< Deltas so 41 Deltas let's take a look as Deltas so 41 Deltas let's take a look as you< you can see just nice we have you can see just nice we have a11< a11 so this just nicely cover the call a11 so this just nicely cover the call spread< spread width so if you were to take a spread width so if you were to take a look< look at your p&amp;l graph down here you can look at your p&amp;l graph down here you can see< see hey we really have no risk to the see hey we really have no risk to the upside< upside right so as you can see there's upside right so as you can see there's no< no no risk to the upside but what you've no no risk to the upside but what you've also< also done is that you've kind of reduced also done is that you've kind of reduced your< your max profit Zone by a little because your max profit Zone by a little because your< your call Credit spread you have shifted your call Credit spread you have shifted from< from the right hand side which was from the right hand side which was previously< previously should be somewhere around previously should be somewhere around here< here you're shifted down here but that's here you're shifted down here but that's fine< fine as well because you know that if fine as well because you know that if the< the market goes up you have no risk to the market goes up you have no risk to the< the upside now what's the other way that the upside now what's the other way that you< you can adjust this so that hey you can you can adjust this so that hey you can still< still get you know slightly more than still get you know slightly more than just< just $1 right you can see if the market just $1 right you can see if the market goes< goes past your call Credit spread it's a goes past your call Credit spread it's a dollar< dollar how can you get more right the dollar how can you get more right the other< other way is to shift your whole put other way is to shift your whole put spread< spread up right because when you shift spread up right because when you shift your< your put spread closer to where the your put spread closer to where the current< current market price is you're going to current market price is you're going to get< get more credit naturally so let us try get more credit naturally so let us try slightly< slightly higher maybe let's go for 490 slightly higher maybe let's go for 490 right< right if you go for 490 let's just play right if you go for 490 let's just play around< around with the strikes and see what we around with the strikes and see what we get< get so now with 49 we can get a130 in get so now with 49 we can get a130 in credit< credit so if the market was to go past credit so if the market was to go past your< your call Credit spread then you're your call Credit spread then you're going< going to get $13 right you're going to going to get $13 right you're going to get< get some profit so again as you can see get some profit so again as you can see this< this is how you actually just play this is how you actually just play around< around with the strikes and adjust it around with the strikes and adjust it according< according to your risk so guys this is according to your risk so guys this is the< the Spy only strategy it has been doing the Spy only strategy it has been doing pretty< pretty well for me so you can definitely pretty well for me so you can definitely try< try this strategy for yourself as well try this strategy for yourself as well by< by the way if you like this video then by the way if you like this video then you're< you're absolutely going to love this you're absolutely going to love this next<

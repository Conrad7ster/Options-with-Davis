all right so I have a number of all right so I have a number of portfolios< portfolios to share with you so let's portfolios to share with you so let's Dive< Dive Right In so the very first Dive Right In so the very first portfolio< portfolio that I want to share with you portfolio that I want to share with you is< is this portfolio over here so this is this portfolio over here so this portfolio< portfolio is with interactive brokers portfolio is with interactive brokers and< and for this one I mainly only trade the and for this one I mainly only trade the wheel< wheel strategy right so as you can see wheel strategy right so as you can see down< down here the stocks that I have here down here the stocks that I have here are< are mainly to trade the wheel strategy are mainly to trade the wheel strategy and< and except maybe for one that I just and except maybe for one that I just realized< realized right so as you can see down realized right so as you can see down here< here there's this stock ticker down here here there's this stock ticker down here it's it's it's d05< d05 that is not part of the US market d05 that is not part of the US market right< right so if you are wondering what kind right so if you are wondering what kind of< of stock is that is this good for wheel of stock is that is this good for wheel strategy< strategy how come I come find that in strategy how come I come find that in the< the US Stock Market on my platform well the US Stock Market on my platform well that's< that's because it's not a US Stock right that's because it's not a US Stock right and< and this stock down here is with my and this stock down here is with my local< local market and the only reason it's local market and the only reason it's here< here is because I wanted to test uh here is because I wanted to test uh interactive< interactive brokers to compare you know interactive brokers to compare you know how< how it is to my local bank uh platform how it is to my local bank uh platform so< so generally I also have a portfolio so generally I also have a portfolio full< full of uh dividend companies so I would full of uh dividend companies so I would invest< invest in all these companies to receive invest in all these companies to receive dividends< dividends and another thing just to dividends and another thing just to Sidetrack< Sidetrack a little bit is that you know Sidetrack a little bit is that you know you< you also want to consider maybe also a you also want to consider maybe also a portfolio< portfolio full of dividend stocks right portfolio full of dividend stocks right so< so this dividend stocks can give you so this dividend stocks can give you dividend< dividend uh over time as a form of dividend uh over time as a form of income< income as well so I believe in multiple income as well so I believe in multiple sources< sources of income so in my Investment sources of income so in my Investment Portfolio< Portfolio dividend is one of them I have Portfolio dividend is one of them I have other< other types of investment income as well other types of investment income as well uh< uh that has nothing to do with options uh that has nothing to do with options right< right so uh this is something that you right so uh this is something that you want< want to consider for yourself as well want to consider for yourself as well all< all right so let's get back to this all right so let's get back to this portfolio< portfolio so this portfolio is mainly on portfolio so this portfolio is mainly on the< the wheel strategy but for the way that the wheel strategy but for the way that I< I trade the wheel strategy is slightly I trade the wheel strategy is slightly different< different from other people so the way different from other people so the way that< that I trade the wheel strategy comes to that I trade the wheel strategy comes to two< two types inside this portfolio so I two types inside this portfolio so I have< have the income grid wheel strategy have the income grid wheel strategy which< which I already shared also in my which I already shared also in my channel< channel so I won't go to detail inside channel so I won't go to detail inside here< here and the other one is what I call here and the other one is what I call the< the enhanced wheel strategy okay so let the enhanced wheel strategy okay so let me< me just get into it uh very quickly so me just get into it uh very quickly so you< you have a context as to how I trade you have a context as to how I trade them< them inside this portfolio so basically them inside this portfolio so basically the< the traditional way how people trade the the traditional way how people trade the wheel< wheel strategy something like this right wheel strategy something like this right so< so imagine this is the price so let's so imagine this is the price so let's say< say for example if the market is say for example if the market is somewhere< somewhere here and somebody wants to get somewhere here and somebody wants to get into< into the wheel strategy you first start into the wheel strategy you first start off< off with the cash secur put right so the off with the cash secur put right so the cash< cash secure put when you sell it you're cash secure put when you sell it you're going< going to get a premium for it right so going to get a premium for it right so two< two things going to happen if it expires two things going to happen if it expires worthless< worthless that means the market stays worthless that means the market stays above< above this cash secure put by expiration above this cash secure put by expiration then< then you're just going to receive the then you're just going to receive the premium< premium right but if it goes all the way premium right but if it goes all the way down< down which is also what you don't mind down which is also what you don't mind which< which is what you want as well you're which is what you want as well you're going< going to get a sign right at expiration going to get a sign right at expiration if< if it stays below this cash secure put if it stays below this cash secure put so< so once you get assigned what's going to so once you get assigned what's going to happen< happen is that you're going to get a 100 happen is that you're going to get a 100 shares< shares right per cash secure put that shares right per cash secure put that you< you have on now the next step is that you have on now the next step is that you< you want to sell what's called a covered you want to sell what's called a covered call< call so when you sell a cover call call so when you sell a cover call basically< basically it's a way for you to also get basically it's a way for you to also get some< some income because you're going to some income because you're going to receive< receive premium for it and then if the receive premium for it and then if the market< market goes back up then you're going to market goes back up then you're going to get< get called away on your shares and you get called away on your shares and you do< do the wheel strategy all over again do the wheel strategy all over again right< right so basically the trade additional right so basically the trade additional wheel< wheel strategy how most people do it is wheel strategy how most people do it is that< that they only have two income sources that they only have two income sources right< right all they want to do is just keep right all they want to do is just keep selling< selling the cash secure put and a cover selling the cash secure put and a cover call< call just to keep getting the income but call just to keep getting the income but for< for myself the way I trade it is for myself the way I trade it is slightly< slightly different right so first of all slightly different right so first of all I< I have the income grid wheel strategy so I have the income grid wheel strategy so the< the income grid wheel strategy basically the income grid wheel strategy basically is< is instead of having one level of cash is instead of having one level of cash secure< secure putut whereby you know if the secure putut whereby you know if the market< market goes all the way down you can get market goes all the way down you can get caught< caught in there and then basically caught in there and then basically you'll< you'll be trapped in the position you'll be trapped in the position position< position for a long time like many position for a long time like many people< people have in 2022 or when the market people have in 2022 or when the market crashes< crashes right so the way to actually you crashes right so the way to actually you know< know sort of like reduce the chances of know sort of like reduce the chances of this< this happening is to have multiple cash this happening is to have multiple cash secure< secure puts now one thing I want to secure puts now one thing I want to really< really point out down here is that the really point out down here is that the risk< risk is actually no different from the risk is actually no different from the ordinary< ordinary way where you do the wheel ordinary way where you do the wheel strategy< strategy the only difference is that you strategy the only difference is that you stagger< stagger out your position so let's say stagger out your position so let's say for< for example if you're trading the normal for example if you're trading the normal wheel< wheel strategy let's say for example you wheel strategy let's say for example you can< can sell three Cash secure put right can sell three Cash secure put right that< that is your position size so if you can that is your position size so if you can sell< sell three Cash secure put instead of sell three Cash secure put instead of putting< putting it all on just one level what putting it all on just one level what you< you want to do is you actually split you want to do is you actually split them< them up into three different levels so them up into three different levels so this< this way at least if the market comes this way at least if the market comes now< now you still can continue selling this now you still can continue selling this premium< premium right the cash secure put at the premium right the cash secure put at the same< same time if you do get filled in the same time if you do get filled in the sense< sense whereby you assign on all the cash sense whereby you assign on all the cash secure< secure put at least your average price secure put at least your average price right< right now will be slightly lower than if right now will be slightly lower than if you< you all had it at one place right this you all had it at one place right this way< way it's easier for the stock to break way it's easier for the stock to break even< even or even be in a profit as the even or even be in a profit as the market< market comes up so on the way down you market comes up so on the way down you stagger< stagger your entries and then on the way stagger your entries and then on the way up< up same thing as well you stagger your up same thing as well you stagger your covered< covered cost so you do not sell your covered cost so you do not sell your cover< cover cost all at one place right you cover cost all at one place right you stagger< stagger it as it goes up so this way you stagger it as it goes up so this way you know< know you can keep selling the cash cut know you can keep selling the cash cut put< put as well as the cover call so this is put as well as the cover call so this is the< the main G of the income grid wheel the main G of the income grid wheel strategy< strategy now the other thing that I do strategy now the other thing that I do that< that most people are find do not that most people are find do not actually< actually do in their wheel strategy is actually do in their wheel strategy is to< to actually get the capital gains part to actually get the capital gains part of< of the wheel strategy so for example let of the wheel strategy so for example let me< me just remove this right now there are me just remove this right now there are two< two ways most people actually getting an two ways most people actually getting an income< income from this wheel strategy so income from this wheel strategy so number< number one sell the cash secure putut so number one sell the cash secure putut so when< when you do this you get some profit now when you do this you get some profit now number< number two you sell the cover call when number two you sell the cover call when you< you sell the cover call you're also you sell the cover call you're also going< going to get some premium in the form of going to get some premium in the form of income< income but number three is what's income but number three is what's generally< generally missing from most people and generally missing from most people and that< that is the capital gain right capital that is the capital gain right capital gain< gain for me is quite important for the gain for me is quite important for the account< account as well because this is where account as well because this is where you're< you're going to get growth right growth you're going to get growth right growth whereby< whereby if the stock actually goes up whereby if the stock actually goes up you< you actually profit from the gain of the you actually profit from the gain of the stock< stock as well right so if the market stock as well right so if the market comes comes comes down< down uh below this price down here your down uh below this price down here your your< your cash output you're going to get 100 your cash output you're going to get 100 shares< shares so once you get 100 shares you shares so once you get 100 shares you don't< don't immediately sell the cover C right don't immediately sell the cover C right it's< it's not necessary for you to just keep it's not necessary for you to just keep selling< selling the cover call the moment you selling the cover call the moment you get< get fill right you could actually wait get fill right you could actually wait for< for the market to go back up before you for the market to go back up before you sell< sell the cover call so this way right sell the cover call so this way right you< you actually earn the difference in you actually earn the difference in terms< terms of the profit of the shares right terms of the profit of the shares right so< so if you get assigned at this level so if you get assigned at this level here< here and then you have your shares C here and then you have your shares C away< away here you have an additional profit. away here you have an additional profit of< of the capital gains so when you do it of the capital gains so when you do it this< this way your portfolio can really grow this way your portfolio can really grow as< as well instead of just relying on this as well instead of just relying on this two< two income because many times you will two income because many times you will find< find that if you get in at the wrong find that if you get in at the wrong price< price which is what a lot of people price which is what a lot of people actually< actually experience then it's very hard actually experience then it's very hard to< to keep getting the income right now to keep getting the income right now because< because you're stuck with the the shares because you're stuck with the the shares and< and it's way below your current entry and it's way below your current entry price< price even cover calls it's going to be price even cover calls it's going to be difficult< difficult for you to get you know any difficult for you to get you know any premium< premium if you want to sell it above or premium if you want to sell it above or at< at where your cash secure put is now the at where your cash secure put is now the other< other way that I trade the wheel other way that I trade the wheel strategy< strategy is what I call the enhanced strategy is what I call the enhanced wheel< wheel strategy right so basically the wheel strategy right so basically the way< way that I trade with this enhanced way that I trade with this enhanced wheel< wheel strategy is instead of using the wheel strategy is instead of using the traditional< traditional cash secure put what we're traditional cash secure put what we're going< going to do instead is we're going to going to do instead is we're going to enter< enter into the position with what's enter into the position with what's called< called a put ratio spread so if' been called a put ratio spread so if' been watching< watching my channel for quite some time watching my channel for quite some time then< then you know that I like the put ratio then you know that I like the put ratio spread< spread quite a bit because I use them spread quite a bit because I use them quite< quite often to enter into my trades so quite often to enter into my trades so the< the put ratio spread in this case the put ratio spread in this case basically< basically is using the cash secure put basically is using the cash secure put the< the premium that you receive from that the premium that you receive from that to< to finance the purchase of a put debit to finance the purchase of a put debit spread< spread right so when you have the put spread right so when you have the put debit< debit spread if the market comes down debit spread if the market comes down what< what you're going to do is you sell off what you're going to do is you sell off the< the put debit spread for a profit then the put debit spread for a profit then you're< you're left with the cash secure put you're left with the cash secure put right< right then in this way you just manage right then in this way you just manage it< it as you would with the traditional it as you would with the traditional wheel< wheel strategy so once you get assigned wheel strategy so once you get assigned let's< let's say for example you get into the let's say for example you get into the 100< 100 shares now on the way up instead of 100 shares now on the way up instead of selling< selling the covered call what you're selling the covered call what you're going< going to do is you're going to sell the going to do is you're going to sell the call< call ratio spread right so the call call ratio spread right so the call ratio< ratio spread is basically using a ratio spread is basically using a covered< covered call and then using the premium covered call and then using the premium from< from there to finance a call debit from there to finance a call debit spread< spread right so this way if the market spread right so this way if the market goes< goes up and it goes past this call ratio goes up and it goes past this call ratio spread< spread what you're going to do is that spread what you're going to do is that you< you can sell off the call debit spread you can sell off the call debit spread for< for a profit and then you left with the for a profit and then you left with the cover< cover call so that's basically the two cover call so that's basically the two different< different ways that I trade the wheel different ways that I trade the wheel strategy< strategy now the next very important strategy now the next very important thing< thing I want to touch about whenever you thing I want to touch about whenever you want< want to trade the wheel strategy for me want to trade the wheel strategy for me personally< personally is that you need to choose personally is that you need to choose the< the right stock right the stock the right stock right the stock selection< selection is very important because if selection is very important because if you< you want to have the capital gains on you want to have the capital gains on the< the stock the stock that you choose the stock the stock that you choose needs< needs to have a a chance to eventually needs to have a a chance to eventually go< go up over time right that is why you go up over time right that is why you know< know I tend to want to choose know I tend to want to choose fundamentally< fundamentally strong stocks right fundamentally strong stocks right fundamentally< fundamentally strong stocks whereby you fundamentally strong stocks whereby you know< know their income statement is strong know their income statement is strong generally< generally I like to see that you know generally I like to see that you know the< the companies are profitable over the the companies are profitable over the past< past few years right so if the company past few years right so if the company is< is not profitable at all then chances is not profitable at all then chances are< are that it can also reflect in the are that it can also reflect in the stock< stock price you'll notice that many stock price you'll notice that many times< times a lot of the companies that are times a lot of the companies that are not< not making money they're not profitable not making money they're not profitable the< the stock actually don't go up right the stock actually don't go up right they< they will just go sideways up and down they will just go sideways up and down and< and basically it's going nowhere for and basically it's going nowhere for most< most of the time so that is why if you most of the time so that is why if you also< also want to get the capital gains then also want to get the capital gains then the< the stock selection part is very the stock selection part is very important< important right don't just go for stocks important right don't just go for stocks that< that are very high volatility because a that are very high volatility because a lot< lot of people like to go for high lot of people like to go for high volatility< volatility thinking that hey I get a lot volatility thinking that hey I get a lot of< of Premium just from selling the cash of Premium just from selling the cash cut< cut put and a cover call yes you get a cut put and a cover call yes you get a lot< lot of uh premium for that but the lot of uh premium for that but the problem< problem is that if the stock never goes problem is that if the stock never goes up< up and the wheel strategy is generally a up and the wheel strategy is generally a bullish< bullish strategy where you want it to go bullish strategy where you want it to go up< up then you can get into trouble right up then you can get into trouble right some< some people get into the wheel strategy some people get into the wheel strategy they< they sell in terms of the premium they they sell in terms of the premium they get< get a lot but the stock keeps crashing get a lot but the stock keeps crashing and< and it never comes back up and in the and it never comes back up and in the end< end they actually lose money so that is end they actually lose money so that is why< why stock selection is important so very why stock selection is important so very important< important do not look at my list down important do not look at my list down here< here the stocks that I trade and say here the stocks that I trade and say that< that hey I'm going to follow exactly as that hey I'm going to follow exactly as Davis< Davis because you see he is making money Davis because you see he is making money on< on his stocks right except maybe for the on his stocks right except maybe for the last< last one well at least not yet right so last one well at least not yet right so don't< don't do that right because firstly it don't do that right because firstly it may< may be a fundamentally good stock but it may be a fundamentally good stock but it may< may not suit you right because you may may not suit you right because you may not< not think that it's fundamentally good not think that it's fundamentally good you< you might not like it right for example you might not like it right for example some< some people don't like Adobe some people some people don't like Adobe some people don't< don't like Google or meta and they will don't like Google or meta and they will say< say these are crap stocks right so yes say these are crap stocks right so yes perfectly< perfectly fine if you think it's not perfectly fine if you think it's not suitable< suitable for you you don't want to get suitable for you you don't want to get into< into it don't do that right you just into it don't do that right you just want< want to do your own due diligence at want to do your own due diligence at least< least the companies you go for the very least the companies you go for the very list< list is that they are making money they list is that they are making money they are< are a profitable company because every are a profitable company because every stock< stock that you are trading here is a stock that you are trading here is a company< company right so you just need to company right so you just need to understand< understand that now the next thing is understand that now the next thing is that< that it may be a good stock a good that it may be a good stock a good company< company but you may get it at the wrong company but you may get it at the wrong price< price right so again do your due price right so again do your due diligence< diligence don't just jump straight in diligence don't just jump straight in just< just because Davis traded and you want just because Davis traded and you want to< to trade it now the next thing I want to trade it now the next thing I want you< you to take a look at is the p&amp;l down you to take a look at is the p&amp;l down here< here so for the most part when I trade here so for the most part when I trade the< the wheel strategy I kind of get out of the wheel strategy I kind of get out of the< the share right basically the wheel the share right basically the wheel strategy< strategy you get into the shares and strategy you get into the shares and then< then you want to sell the cover call as then you want to sell the cover call as it< it goes up right as you can see the it goes up right as you can see the market< market has been going up recently so market has been going up recently so I've< I've been trying to sell quite a number I've been trying to sell quite a number of< of covered calls so for the most part is of covered calls so for the most part is that< that you're getting in and getting out that you're getting in and getting out of< of the stock but one stock down here I of the stock but one stock down here I want< want you to take a look at is this one want you to take a look at is this one down< down here where you notice the p&amp;l is down here where you notice the p&amp;l is far< far greater than the others right as you far greater than the others right as you can< can see it's over can see it's over $145,000< $145,000 as of this point and this is $145,000 as of this point and this is with< with Google so the reason why this is with Google so the reason why this is much< much more is because I actually hold much more is because I actually hold some< some of the stocks the shares where I some of the stocks the shares where I don't< don't get out of it right so if I get don't get out of it right so if I get ass< ass signed on the shares I actually only ass signed on the shares I actually only get< get out about a part of it right a get out about a part of it right a portion< portion of it I would try and get out portion of it I would try and get out with< with the covered cost because right now with the covered cost because right now the< the market is going up and as you can the market is going up and as you can see< see it's kind of a little bit overboard see it's kind of a little bit overboard so< so I'm trying to get out of some of them so I'm trying to get out of some of them but< but at the same time what if I'm wrong but at the same time what if I'm wrong right< right what if the market continues to go right what if the market continues to go up< up because I still believe strongly in up because I still believe strongly in the< the company so this is one thing I have the company so this is one thing I have conviction< conviction in the company so I think it conviction in the company so I think it can< can go higher if just that maybe right can go higher if just that maybe right now< now it may pull back so that is why I'm now it may pull back so that is why I'm only< only using a part of the the positions only using a part of the the positions which< which I have to sell the cover call so which I have to sell the cover call so how< how do you exactly find out you know how do you exactly find out you know what< what are the stocks to put inside here what are the stocks to put inside here so< so my process is actually nothing so my process is actually nothing special< special right it's like how anybody will special right it's like how anybody will find< find out about the stock so basically I find out about the stock so basically I would< would uh do research on the news right would uh do research on the news right read< read the news and see what some people read the news and see what some people are< are actually investing in what their are actually investing in what their trading< trading I'll also take a look at some trading I'll also take a look at some YouTube< YouTube videos and then I will do my own YouTube videos and then I will do my own due< due diligence right I won't say hey I due diligence right I won't say hey I heard< heard this person is actually doing it heard this person is actually doing it and< and I'm going to get into it right I and I'm going to get into it right I won't< won't do that right I will do my own won't do that right I will do my own research< research and one of the ways that I like research and one of the ways that I like to< to do my research is using finance. to do my research is using finance.

com< google. com and I'll show you a little google.

com and I'll show you a little bit< bit of what I look at inside so this is bit of what I look at inside so this is uh< uh Google Finance so one of the things uh Google Finance so one of the things that< that I really like to look at with that I really like to look at with Google< Google Finance is the income statement Google Finance is the income statement of< of the companies that I'm planning to do of the companies that I'm planning to do the< the wheel strategies on so one of the the wheel strategies on so one of the companies< companies as you know is Google so what companies as you know is Google so what I'll< I'll do is just let's take a look at I'll do is just let's take a look at Google< Google right so as you can see down here Google right so as you can see down here there< there are a number of information that there are a number of information that you< you can take a look at the one that I you can take a look at the one that I like< like to see is this one down here so as like to see is this one down here so as you< you can see down here this is the income you can see down here this is the income statement< statement of Google right so you can see statement of Google right so you can see based< based on quarterly is doing pretty well based on quarterly is doing pretty well and< and annual as well right you can see for and annual as well right you can see for the< the past 5 years revenue is increasing the past 5 years revenue is increasing and< and it's generally still profitable over and it's generally still profitable over the< the past 5 years which is very good the past 5 years which is very good right< right you can go even deeper into seeing right you can go even deeper into seeing all< all these things as well you can go into all these things as well you can go into their< their balance sheet let me just go uh their balance sheet let me just go uh down< down here balance sheet you can see uh down here balance sheet you can see uh the< the balance sheet and as well the cash the balance sheet and as well the cash flows< flows so this will give you you know flows so this will give you you know just< just an insight as to what this company just an insight as to what this company really< really is about so I do suggest that if really is about so I do suggest that if you< you want to trade the whe strategy you you want to trade the whe strategy you do< do want to look into the company to find do want to look into the company to find out< out what actually you're trading as out what actually you're trading as opposed< opposed to you know some of the people opposed to you know some of the people out< out there when they trade the wheel out there when they trade the wheel strategy< strategy they just mainly looking for strategy they just mainly looking for high< high IV right because they want to have high IV right because they want to have the< the juicy premiums they want to sell it the juicy premiums they want to sell it I< I feel that that is doing a little bit I feel that that is doing a little bit of< of a disservice to yourself if you're of a disservice to yourself if you're just< just doing the IV because when you get just doing the IV because when you get into< into the wheel strategy it's a pretty into the wheel strategy it's a pretty Capital< Capital intensive strategy because you Capital intensive strategy because you need< need to actually get into long stock so need to actually get into long stock so if< if you're going to get into the shares if you're going to get into the shares of< of the company you better need to know of the company you better need to know if< if the company is actually going to have if the company is actually going to have a< a chance for it to go up over the long a chance for it to go up over the long term< term right so at least one of the ways term right so at least one of the ways is< is to see if the company is profitable is to see if the company is profitable like< like I mentioned many times so so most like I mentioned many times so so most of< of the stocks that I have in my of the stocks that I have in my portfolio< portfolio tend to have this trade portfolio tend to have this trade whereby< whereby they have been profitable over whereby they have been profitable over the< the past few years with the exception of the past few years with the exception of just< just one stock right and that stock is just one stock right and that stock is paler< paler so let us just get into paler down paler so let us just get into paler down here< here so paler has only recently become here so paler has only recently become profitable< profitable right they weren't profitable profitable right they weren't profitable uh< uh many years ago it's just only uh many years ago it's just only recently< recently so as you can see down here the recently so as you can see down here the income< income statement the quarterly income income statement the quarterly income statement< statement is actually pretty okay right statement is actually pretty okay right they< they just recently turned a profit for they just recently turned a profit for the< the past five quarters they have been the past five quarters they have been increasing< increasing their revenue and the profit increasing their revenue and the profit which< which is good but if you take. a look at which is good but if you take a look at the< the annual you can see that actually the annual you can see that actually they< they lost money before 2023 and only they lost money before 2023 and only turned< turned a profit in 2023 so that is why turned a profit in 2023 so that is why you< you know for the will strategy for the you know for the will strategy for the penum< penum actually do not put in as much as penum actually do not put in as much as the< the other underly but one thing I will the other underly but one thing I will never< never put my money into to do the wheel never put my money into to do the wheel strategy< strategy is stocks like strategy is stocks like gme< gme and why is that so because gme if gme and why is that so because gme if you< you were to go to the financials over you were to go to the financials over here< here you can see that it has not made here you can see that it has not made any< any money at all right you can see that any money at all right you can see that it's< it's been losing money for many years it's been losing money for many years now< now 2024 has not ended so we have no now 2024 has not ended so we have no idea< idea what it is but I'm not going to bet idea what it is but I'm not going to bet on< on the fact that hey it's going to be on the fact that hey it's going to be profitable< profitable that's why I'm going to do profitable that's why I'm going to do the< the uh wheel strategy right for gme this the uh wheel strategy right for gme this kind< kind of stock is actually a very highly kind of stock is actually a very highly manipulated< manipulated stock right highly manipulated stock right highly manipulated< manipulated what I mean is that just one manipulated what I mean is that just one person< person can basically shift the entire person can basically shift the entire sentiment< sentiment of the stock for example sentiment of the stock for example roaring< roaring Kitty right as you can see down roaring Kitty right as you can see down here< here if he tweets about gme then the here if he tweets about gme then the stock< stock is going to shoot up but if he stock is going to shoot up but if he stop< stop talking about it the stock is stop talking about it the stock is suddenly< suddenly just going to die so I don't suddenly just going to die so I don't really< really like this kind of stock and this really like this kind of stock and this is< is something that I'll caution you as is something that I'll caution you as well< well if you're planning to do the wheel well if you're planning to do the wheel strategy< strategy so I'm now in the account strategy so I'm now in the account management< management page of my broker as you can management page of my broker as you can see< see this interactive brokers you can see see this interactive brokers you can see my< my name at the top right down here so my name at the top right down here so you< you can see the net liquidity you can see the net liquidity uh< uh currently is slightly above half a uh currently is slightly above half a million< million dollar right as you can see down million dollar right as you can see down here< here for this portfolio is here for this portfolio is $559,000< $559,000 as of this recording and for $559,000 as of this recording and for this< this past one month right as you can see this past one

com blueprint all right< right back to the video okay so the next right back to the video okay so the next portfolio< portfolio that I want to share with you portfolio that I want to share with you is< is with uh think of swim right so as you is with uh think of swim right so as you can< can see down here I'm using the think of can see down here I'm using the think of swim< swim web platform so now it's under swim web platform so now it's under child< child shap so you will have to log to child shap so you will have to log to your< your chap to be able to access uh the your chap to be able to access uh the think< think of swim platform so basically for think of swim platform so basically for this< this portfolio I have a mixture of this portfolio I have a mixture of strategies< strategies which is different from the strategies which is different from the very< very first portfolio I shared with you very first portfolio I shared with you so< so the first portfolio is mainly all so the first portfolio is mainly all wheel< wheel strategy now for this portfolio I wheel strategy now for this portfolio I have< have a few strategies and the first one have a few strategies and the first one is< is also the wheel strategy right so I is also the wheel strategy right so I also< also trade the wheel strategy in this also trade the wheel strategy in this portfolio< portfolio and then the second one is portfolio and then the second one is lips< lips right so lips I already created a lips right so lips I already created a video< video on it so if you're curious on how video on it so if you're curious on how I< I trade lips you can just go ahead to I trade lips you can just go ahead to find< find the video on my channel and then find the video on my channel and then the< the third one would be the shorter term the third one would be the shorter term trades< trades which is the put ratio spread uh trades which is the put ratio spread uh I< I also have the put broken wing I also have the put broken wing butterfly< butterfly and then also the wide put butterfly and then also the wide put ratio< ratio spread and also the put Condor ratio spread and also the put Condor right< right so these are more shorter term right so these are more shorter term trades< trades down here at the bottom now for trades down here at the bottom now for the< the whe strategy as you know there are the whe strategy as you know there are two< two types right it's uh you get income two types right it's uh you get income as< as well as you get growth right from the as well as you get growth right from the capital< capital gains of the stock now for leaps capital gains of the stock now for leaps it's< it's mainly only growth right because it's mainly only growth right because for< for the way that I trade leap lips is for the way that I trade leap lips is that< that you're actually buying the lips that you're actually buying the lips right< right so this will be a debit so the right so this will be a debit so the only< only way that you can profit from it is only way that you can profit from it is if< if the market goes in the direction of if the market goes in the direction of your< your lips and then finally for this your lips and then finally for this third< third one down here all these strategies third one down here all these strategies down< down here they are all based on income down here they are all based on income right< right so as you can see this is again right so as you can see this is again this< this portfolio is a mixture of income as this portfolio is a mixture of income as well< well as growth now this time you might well as growth now this time you might be< be looking at my this portfolio and be looking at my this portfolio and you're< you're wondering Davis why is your wheel you're wondering Davis why is your wheel strategy< strategy over here right why didn't you strategy over here right why didn't you put< put it in the very first portfolio and put it in the very first portfolio and that< that is a good question and the reason that is a good question and the reason why< why I'm actually doing it this way is why I'm actually doing it this way is because< because I initially all traded in just because I initially all traded in just one< one account right it's actually just one account right it's actually just this< this account that I all trade so all the this account that I all trade so all the strategies< strategies that I trade including the strategies that I trade including the third< third portfolio which I'm going to share third portfolio which I'm going to share with< with you later on all the strategies I with you later on all the strategies I just< just trade here and the account size was just trade here and the account size was over< over a million dollars so at that point over a million dollars so at that point it< it was with TD amerit trade right so TD it was with TD amerit trade right so TD amerit< amerit trade had a presence in my amerit trade had a presence in my country< country so I was comfortable with you country so I was comfortable with you know< know trading the large account there but know trading the large account there but when< when Schwab actually bought over TD Amer when Schwab actually bought over TD Amer trade< trade uh they basically kind of removed trade uh they basically kind of removed the< the presence in my country right so now the presence in my country right so now it's< it's pretty much all in the US side so I it's pretty much all in the US side so I spoke< spoke to a number of people and spoke to a number of people and apparently< apparently the sentiment of sh was not apparently the sentiment of sh was not that< that positive compared to TD am merri so that positive compared to TD am merri so that< that is why I'm trying to play safe so that is why I'm trying to play safe so what< what I've done is that I've just what I've done is that I've just Diversified< Diversified uh my portfolio into three Diversified uh my portfolio into three different< different accounts right because uh the different accounts right because uh the SI< SI PC as I understand uh only ures up to SI PC as I understand uh only ures up to $500,000< $500,000 of your account if the $500,000 of your account if the brokerage< brokerage fail now that's not to say brokerage fail now that's not to say that< that shop will fail right I still that shop will fail right I still believe< believe shop is a strong company but hey believe shop is a strong company but hey you< you never know right so in the event if you never know right so in the event if the< the company does fail at least you know the company does fail at least you know I've< I've been insured up to you know half a I've been insured up to you know half a million< million so that is why I separate my million so that is why I separate my account< account I try to you know split them account I try to you know split them equally< equally among the three accounts so this equally among the three accounts so this way< way at least if one fail I still have way at least if one fail I still have the< the sipc ENC caring me for one of them the sipc ENC caring me for one of them and< and then I still can trade on the other and then I still can trade on the other two< two platforms so this is just a form of two platforms so this is just a form of diversification< diversification uh just in case if the diversification uh just in case if the broker< broker feeli like back then right you broker feeli like back then right you know< know MF Global was a big uh issue back know MF Global was a big uh issue back then< then and then also when a lot of these then and then also when a lot of these investment< investment Banks fail right so you never investment Banks fail right so you never know< know what's going to happen so if you do know what's going to happen so if you do not< not have more than half a million hey not have more than half a million hey don't< don't do this right there there's no don't do this right there there's no problem< problem just trading just one brokerage problem just trading just one brokerage but< but if you have more than half a million but if you have more than half a million then< then you know you can consider what I'm then you know you can consider what I'm doing< doing down here all right so let's get doing down here all right so let's get back< back to this portfolio down here so as back to this portfolio down here so as you< you can see this portfolio over here has you can see this portfolio over here has three< three different kinds of uh types of three different kinds of uh types of strategy< strategy so to speak so for the most strategy so to speak so for the most part< part you can see that the kind of part you can see that the kind of underlines< underlines that I choose tend to be the underlines that I choose tend to be the positive< positive drift one whereby the market positive drift one whereby the market will< will go up over time right so as the will go up over time right so as the market< market goes up over time the strategies market goes up over time the strategies that< that will benefit from this will be the that will benefit from this will be the wheel< wheel as well as the lips but what if wheel as well as the lips but what if the< the market starts to come down the market starts to come down momentarily< momentarily right maybe the market goes momentarily right maybe the market goes sideways< sideways or even there's a very big sideways or even there's a very big correction< correction the market comes down so this correction the market comes down so this is< is where the shorter term trades will is where the shorter term trades will come< come in so these are the trades where I come in so these are the trades where I get< get in and then get out so that's why get in and then get out so that's why you< you can see over here in the p&amp;l open is you can see over here in the p&amp;l open is that< that you know certain p&amp;l do not have a that you know certain p&amp;l do not have a very< very big one compared to the rest right very big one compared to the rest right because< because they are more shorter term right because they are more shorter term right I< I trade them and then I get up but that I trade them and then I get up but that is< is not to say they're not as profitable is not to say they're not as profitable as< as the other underlying that I trade no as the other underlying that I trade no they< they are very profitable as well so they are very profitable as well so right< right now I'm in my account management right now I'm in my account management page< page uh inside Char shop as you can see page uh inside Char shop as you can see down< down here it recently moved from TDM down here it recently moved from TDM trade< trade to char shop so I was one of the trade to char shop so I was one of the uh< uh clients where I started off with TDM uh clients where I started off with TDM trade< trade and then Char shop uh moved my trade and then Char shop uh moved my account< account over to them so as you can see account over to them so as you can see over< over here this account uh is doing not over here this account uh is doing not so< so bad as well right as you can see down so bad as well right as you can see down here< here for the past one month down here here for the past one month down here you< you can see that the total value right you can see that the total value right now< now is over half a million as well right now is over half a million as well right so< so it's about so it's about $562,000< $562,000 and you can see for the one $562,000 and you can see for the one month< month change month change uh< uh this last one month it made about uh this last one month it made about $61,000< $61,000 so not too bad right the $61,000 so not too bad right the previous< previous portfolio did about 50 previous portfolio did about 50 something< something th000 and you can see over something th000 and you can see over here< here let me just quickly get my pointer here let me just quickly get my pointer so< so as you can see at the start of month so as you can see at the start of month is< is roughly just over 500,000 and towards is roughly just over 500,000 and towards the< the end as of this recording right the end as of this recording right slightly< slightly above slightly above $550,000< $550,000 so this portfolio also is doing $550,000 so this portfolio also is doing not< not so bad so the third and final not so bad so the third and final portfolio< portfolio that I want to share with you portfolio that I want to share with you is< is my my tasty trade portfolio so as you is my my tasty trade portfolio so as you can< can see in this portfolio there are a can see in this portfolio there are a few< few things going on right so there are a few things going on right so there are a few< few components so the very first few components so the very first component< component of this portfolio as you can component of this portfolio as you can see< see right at the top are the t- bills see right at the top are the t- bills right< right so in this portfolio I have some T right so in this portfolio I have some T bills< bills and in my humble opinion I think bills and in my humble opinion I think that< that the t- bills at least as of this that the t- bills at least as of this point< point is a pretty good way for you to point is a pretty good way for you to get< get some risk-free profits right because get some risk-free profits right because it's< it's guaranteed by the US government if it's guaranteed by the US government if you< you hold all the way to maturity and you hold all the way to maturity and provided< provided that the US government doesn't provided that the US government doesn't fail< fail right of course if the US fail right of course if the US government< government fail then I think there's government fail then I think there's going< going to be much more problems in the going to be much more problems in the world< world right if they default on the bonds world right if they default on the bonds but< but for the most part I think it's but for the most part I think it's pretty< pretty safe right so if you're not pretty safe right so if you're not familiar< familiar with what the T bills are familiar with what the T bills are basically< basically uh you always buy at a basically uh you always buy at a discounted< discounted value right so there's the discounted value right so there's the discounted< discounted value and then there's the discounted value and then there's the face< face value upon maturity so as you can face value upon maturity so as you can see< see on the right hand side down here see on the right hand side down here this< this is the average open price so on this is the average open price so on tasty< tasty trade it it shows a 960 so the tasty trade it it shows a 960 so the price< price which I bought it at is price which I bought it at is $960< $960 this is not that I've lost $960 $960 this is not that I've lost $960 it's< it's not there right so this p&amp;l open it's not there right so this p&amp;l open right< right you see at the top it doesn't right you see at the top it doesn't reflect< reflect uh this T bills right so t- reflect uh this T bills right so t- bills< bills basically when you buy it it's as bills basically when you buy it it's as of< of a discounted value and then upon of a discounted value and then upon maturity< maturity if you hold all the way to the maturity if you hold all the way to the maturity< maturity basically the maturity you can maturity basically the maturity you can see< see on the TS down here is uh towards see on the TS down here is uh towards the< the end of October which is not too far the end of October which is. not too far from< from now the pH value then becomes from now the pH value then becomes $1,000< $1,000 right so you bought it at $1,000 right so you bought it at $960< $960 it is guaranteed to become $1,000 $960 it is guaranteed to become $1,000 upon< upon maturity right that is if you hold upon maturity right that is if you hold all< all the way to maturity but if you were all the way to maturity but if you were to< to decide to get out of it halfway then to decide to get out of it halfway then it's< it's possible that you could lose money it's possible that you could lose money right< right it depends on what it's trading right it depends on what it's trading for< for at the point of time when you want for at the point of time when you want to< to close it so as you can see down here to close it so as you can see down here this< this is the current close price of the T this is the current close price of the T bills< bills that I bought and it's at 982 so bills that I bought and it's at 982 so at< at the moment right now it's in a profit at the moment right now it's in a profit of< of course but there are times whereby of course but there are times whereby you< you know especially when you first buy you know especially when you first buy it< it it's possible that it could be in a it it's possible that it could be in a loss< loss right the price could have gone loss right the price could have gone lower< lower so that is why if you want to put lower so that is why if you want to put you< you know some cash into the T bills it's you know some cash into the T bills it's best< best that you hold all the way to best that you hold all the way to maturity< maturity rather than you trade it right maturity rather than you trade it right so< so I definitely do not suggest to trade so I definitely do not suggest to trade t-< t- BS in this way right so for this one t- BS in this way right so for this one you< you can see that I have purchased you can see that I have purchased roughly roughly roughly 210< 210 TS 210 TS so< so that means to say at upon maturity so that means to say at upon maturity I'll< I'll get $210 * $11,000 that's about I'll get $210 * $11,000 that's about $210,000< $210,000 right so this is the uh roughly $210,000 right so this is the uh roughly this< this is also uh the capital that I put this is also uh the capital that I put up< up right so uh it's a very good way for up right so uh it's a very good way for you< you to diversify your portfolio as well you to diversify your portfolio as well because< because you know if you do have some because you know if you do have some spare< spare cash lying around you definitely spare cash lying around you definitely can< can put into some TBS instead of putting can put into some TBS instead of putting all< all into options right so I again all into options right so I again believe< believe in you know diversifying a believe in you know diversifying a little< little bit here and there into slightly little bit here and there into slightly different< different product types so for example different product types so for example the< the profits that I get from this t- the profits that I get from this t- bills< bills down here I can actually use to bills down here I can actually use to boost< boost whatever profits that I made in my boost whatever profits that I made in my portfolio< portfolio right if I trade the options I portfolio right if I trade the options I made< made some profits this will be added on made some profits this will be added on top< top of it and if you're not profitable top of it and if you're not profitable when< when you're trading options hopefully when you're trading options hopefully not< not right then at least the kind of not right then at least the kind of profits< profits you get from the t- bills can be profits you get from the t- bills can be used< used to cushion or offset some of the used to cushion or offset some of the losses< losses that you have so this is the losses that you have so this is the first< first component of this portfolio first component of this portfolio now< now the second component of this now the second component of this portfolio< portfolio is where I buy some shares portfolio is where I buy some shares right< right I don't buy too many but basically right I don't buy too many but basically you< you know I like to punt uh on certain you know I like to punt uh on certain underlyings< underlyings uh just a little bit to buy underlyings uh just a little bit to buy some< some shares you definitely don't have to some shares you definitely don't have to but< but I do have some inside this portfolio but I do have some inside this portfolio as< as well because some of the underlying as well because some of the underlying actually< actually do not have options right like actually do not have options right like for< for example ibid right ibid if you're for example ibid right ibid if you're not< not familiar with this this is basically not familiar with this this is basically the< the Bitcoin uh ETF so I do want to the Bitcoin uh ETF so I do want to partake< partake into it so there's no options on partake into it so there's no options on it< it right now so for this ibid I just buy it right now so for this ibid I just buy some< some shares here and there just for some shares here and there just for speculation< speculation purposes now the third and speculation purposes now the third and final< final component of this portfolio are final component of this portfolio are the< the options right so basically options the options right so basically options are< are the main G of this portfolio and the are the main G of this portfolio and the strategies< strategies that I trade down here are strategies that I trade down here are mainly< mainly the income mainly the income strategies< strategies right so income strategies strategies right so income strategies are< are basically more shorter term are basically more shorter term strategies< strategies as compared to maybe the strategies as compared to maybe the wheel< wheel strategy or the lips because those wheel strategy or the lips because those are< are slightly more longer or rather are slightly more longer or rather midterm< midterm strategies where you hold for midterm strategies where you hold for slightly< slightly longer time but whereas for slightly longer time but whereas for this< this portfolio I mainly trade the income this portfolio I mainly trade the income strategies< strategies where you get in and out in a strategies where you get in and out in a relatively< relatively short time so let me get into relatively short time so let me get into the< the exact strategies that I trade for the exact strategies that I trade for this< this portfolio so the very first this portfolio so the very first strategy< strategy that I trade is the credit strategy that I trade is the credit spreads< spreads right so the credit spreads I've spreads right so the credit spreads I've already< already created many videos on this already created many videos on this inside< inside my channel so definitely go into inside my channel so definitely go into my< my channel and look at the credit my channel and look at the credit spreads< spreads I share with you exactly you spreads I share with you exactly you know< know how to trade them and credit know how to trade them and credit spreads< spreads are a very beginner friendly spreads are a very beginner friendly strategy< strategy because they are only two Ls strategy because they are only two Ls into< into uh the strategy as opposed to some into uh the strategy as opposed to some of< of the other strategies so credit of the other strategies so credit spreads< spreads definitely you can look into spreads definitely you can look into them< them if you're interested now the second them if you're interested now the second strategy< strategy that I have is What's called strategy that I have is What's called the< the Jade lizard right so the Jade lizard the Jade lizard right so the Jade lizard is< is basically a short putut and a call is basically a short putut and a call Credit< Credit spread so it's an undefined risk Credit spread so it's an undefined risk strategy< strategy now if you don't have a big strategy now if you don't have a big enough< enough account size to put on the Jade enough account size to put on the Jade lizard< lizard then you can go for What's called lizard then you can go for What's called the< the Jade iron Condor right so the jadeon the Jade iron Condor right so the jadeon Condor< Condor is a name that I came up with I Condor is a name that I came up with I coined< coined this mainly because uh I took coined this mainly because uh I took after< after the Jade lizard which is named by after the Jade lizard which is named by the< the tasty trade folks right so the Jade the tasty trade folks right so the Jade iron< iron Condor is basically the defined iron Condor is basically the defined risk< risk version so if you have a small risk version so if you have a small account< account you can definitely trade the J account you can definitely trade the J iron< iron Condor so the Jade iron Condor and iron Condor so the Jade iron Condor and the< the Jade lizard is a construct that has the Jade lizard is a construct that has no< no risk to the the upside right so if no risk to the the upside right so if you're< you're afraid you know the the you're afraid you know the the underlying< underlying that you're trading is going underlying that you're trading is going to< to keep going up and up and up then you to keep going up and up and up then you can< can definitely trade the J lizard or the can definitely trade the J lizard or the jadeon< jadeon Condor now the third strategy jadeon Condor now the third strategy that< that I trade over here is What's called that I trade over here is What's called the< the strangle right so I have quite a the strangle right so I have quite a number< number of videos on the strangle as well number of videos on the strangle as well so< so strangle again is an undefined risk so strangle again is an undefined risk strategy< strategy very good if the market goes strategy very good if the market goes sideways< sideways right the market goes sideways sideways right the market goes sideways the< the strangle is where it really shines the strangle is where it really shines and< and if you don't have the capital or the and if you don't have the capital or the buying< buying how to put on a strangle on the buying how to put on a strangle on the underline< underline then you can go for the underline then you can go for the defined< defined risk version which is the iron defined risk version which is the iron Condor< Condor right so iron Condor again I have Condor right so iron Condor again I have a< a number of videos that I've shared on a number of videos that I've shared on my< my channel as well and also have created my channel as

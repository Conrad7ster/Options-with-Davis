right so why< why am I asking this question so the why am I asking this question so the reason< reason I'm saying all this right now is reason I'm saying all this right now is because< because I've actually had quite a number because I've actually had quite a number of< of people that have reached out to me to of people that have reached out to me to ask< ask this very question you know ask this very question you know especially< especially somewhere around here when especially somewhere around here when the< the market started to come down the market started to come down and< and they were a little bit worried so and they were a little bit worried so they< they asked me you know Davis do you they asked me you know Davis do you think< think the market is going to go down think the market is going to go down even< even further is there going to be a even further is there going to be a market< market crash and if so what can we do to market crash and if so what can we do to protect< protect our portfolio so I think the protect our portfolio so I think the last< last question about asking you know what last question about asking you know what can< can we do to protect the portfolio if can we do to protect the portfolio if the< the market crash is actually a very good the market crash is actually a very good question< question and that's what I really want question and that's what I really want to< to address inside this video is how you to address inside this video is how you can< can protect your portfolio in the event can protect your portfolio in the event the< the market actually goes down so in the market actually goes down so in order< order to answer this question I want to order to answer this question I want to share< share with you a slide over here which share with you a slide over here which is< is just part of a training which I get is just part of a training which I get all< all my membership students to go through all my membership students to go through inside< inside my membership program and it's a inside my membership program and it's a very< very important trading that they must very important trading that they must understand< understand even before they start to understand even before they start to place< place any trade so as you can see over place any trade so as you can see over here< here this is on the winning mindset of here this is on the winning mindset of successful< successful options Traders so over here successful options Traders so over here I< I list three important points that is I list three important points that is very< very important that I feel every option very important that I feel every option Trader< Trader should really understand so the Trader should really understand so the first< first point you can see that I mentioned first point you can see that I mentioned that< that the successful options Trader that the successful options Trader relies< relies on statistics to trade relies on statistics to trade objectively< objectively and not base his or her objectively and not base his or her trading< trading decision based on emotions fear trading decision based on emotions fear and< and greed so I'm sure that you may have and greed so I'm sure that you may have certain< certain option positions right now certain option positions right now whereby< whereby maybe it's uh going against your whereby maybe it's uh going against your position< position the market has started to come position the market has started to come down< down quite a bit and you're worried that down quite a bit and you're worried that the< the market may even crash so you might the market may even crash so you might be< be tempted to just get out of this trade be tempted to just get out of this trade so< so whether you actually get out of this so whether you actually get out of this trade< trade shouldn't be a result of your trade shouldn't be a result of your emotions< emotions shouldn't be because you're emotions shouldn't be because you're feeling< feeling fearful that the market is going feeling fearful that the market is going to< to go down that's why you decide to cut to go down that's why you decide to cut it< it but instead you should be basing your it but instead you should be basing your decision< decision based on what you've already decision based on what you've already known< known of the strategy and the statistics known of the strategy and the statistics so< so for example if your strategy is to so for example if your strategy is to exit< exit at let's say expiration or maybe at exit at let's say expiration or maybe at 21< 21 DTE you should stick to that 21 DTE you should stick to that regardless< regardless where the market is going regardless where the market is going because< because if you already have studied your because if you already have studied your strategy< strategy and you have seen the strategy and you have seen the statistics< statistics especially some of the statistics especially some of the statistics< statistics that I've shared on my statistics that I've shared on my channel< channel in my videos then you should be channel in my videos then you should be confident< confident going forward knowing that confident going forward knowing that even< even though if there's going to be a even though if there's going to be a crash< crash you know that there will be losses crash you know that there will be losses here< here and there but over the long term as here and there but over the long term as long< long as you stick to the way that you're long as you stick to the way that you're trading< trading statistics have already shown trading statistics have already shown that< that you have a positive Edge so we that you have a positive Edge so we shouldn't< shouldn't be managing our position based shouldn't be managing our position based on< on our emotions now second thing is that on our emotions now second thing is. that the< the successful options Trader the successful options Trader understands< understands that no one can predict understands that no one can predict where< where the market is going to go and where the market is going to go and doesn't< doesn't try to so the question if you're doesn't try to so the question if you're asking< asking as well Davis do you think the asking as well Davis do you think the market< market is going to go up or is it going market is going to go up or is it going to< to go down this is a pointless question to go down this is a pointless question because< because the answer is I don't know and because the answer is I don't know and nobody< nobody else knows as well and if nobody else knows as well and if somebody< somebody can tell you with 100% somebody can tell you with 100% certainty< certainty that they know where the certainty that they know where the market< market is going to go tomorrow or in the market is going to go tomorrow or in the next< next one week then I will suggest you to next one week then I will suggest you to be< be very careful or wary about what that be very careful or wary about what that person< person saying so to ask that question person saying so to ask that question where< where you think the market is going is where you think the market is going is actually< actually the wrong question but a good actually the wrong question but a good question< question to ask is actually to ask what question to ask is actually to ask what should< should you do with your portfolio if the should you do with your portfolio if the market< market actually goes down that means to market actually goes down that means to say< say this shows that you are actually say this shows that you are actually planning< planning beforehand you are preparing planning beforehand you are preparing for< for the event if the market actually for the event if the market actually crashes< crashes or go down and you already have crashes or go down and you already have you< you know strategies or positions in you know strategies or positions in place< place to capture that move down so place to capture that move down so that's< that's where this third Point comes in that's where this third Point comes in where< where the successful option Trader does where the successful option Trader does the< the planning before he or she enters the the planning before he or she enters the trade< trade and already knows well in advance trade and already knows well in advance what< what he or she will do when the market what he or she will do when the market gets< gets there you already have a plan in gets there you already have a plan in advance< advance not because you see the market advance not because you see the market is< is crashing you're starting to get is crashing you're starting to get emotional< emotional you see the loss start getting emotional you see the loss start getting bigger< bigger then you want to exit that that bigger then you want to exit that that is< is always the wrong decision so when is always the wrong decision so when you're< you're already well prepared wherever you're already well prepared wherever the< the market goes all you got to do is the market goes all you got to do is simply< simply execute your plan in short you simply execute your plan in short you must< must have a plan for whatever scenario must have a plan for whatever scenario the< the market can give you so especially the market can give you so especially the< the worst case scenario which is most of the worst case scenario which is most of the< the time a market crash which is what the time a market crash which is what many< many people want want to avoid so this many people want want to avoid so this is< is a quote by William eart who is is a quote by William eart who is featured< featured in the book Market Wizards by featured in the book Market Wizards by Jack< Jack shagger if you haven't read that Jack shagger if you haven't read that book< book definitely give it a r because it's book definitely give it a r because it's a< a very good book to understand the a very good book to understand the mindset< mindset of some of these uh Traders so mindset of some of these uh Traders so William< William ehart had this quote inside this William ehart had this quote inside this book< book where he says don't think about book where he says don't think about what< what the Market's going to do you have what the Market's going to do you have absolutely< absolutely no control over that instead absolutely no control over that instead think< think about what you're going to do if think about what you're going to do if it< it gets there so again this is all about it gets there so again this is all about preparing< preparing in advance and when the market preparing in advance and when the market actually< actually goes to wherever it goes you actually goes to wherever it goes you already< already have a plan for it and you just already have a plan for it and you just execute< execute it so now on to the question so execute it so now on to the question so how< how can we actually prepare our how can we actually prepare our portfolio< portfolio in the event the market portfolio in the event the market actually< actually is going to go down or there's actually is going to go down or there's a< a market crash so I'm going to go a market crash so I'm going to go through< through a few option strategies where through a few option strategies where you< you can use to

com blueprint all right back to< to the video so the very first strategy to the video so the very first strategy I< I want to share with you would be the I want to share with you would be the plain< plain vanilla put option strategy plain vanilla put option strategy basically< basically to just buy a put so let me basically to just buy a put so let me just< just go to use uh this uh option down just go to use uh this uh option down here< here the 45 here the 45 dte1< dte1 now in the event the market dte1 now in the event the market actually< actually is going to crash there's going actually is going to crash there's going to< to be a very big move down then the best to be a very big move down then the best way< way to really protect your portfolio is way to really protect your portfolio is in< in the form of buying a put option this in the form of buying a put option this is< is the most plain simple way to actually is the most plain simple way to actually uh< uh protect your portfolio to the uh protect your portfolio to the downside< downside because if the market actually downside because if the market actually goes< goes down you can make more as it goes goes down you can make more as it goes down< down so if I was to show you the p&amp;l down so if I was to show you the p&amp;l graph< graph down here you can see that just by graph down here you can see that just by simply< simply buying a put option you have kind simply buying a put option you have kind of< of unlimited profits to the downside all of unlimited profits to the downside all the< the way down to zero so at the same time the way down to zero so at the same time if< if the market goes up uh you are also if the market goes up uh you are also protected< protected you don't lose uh infinite protected you don't lose uh infinite amounts< amounts so there's always a cap to how amounts so there's always a cap to how much< much you can lose so if there's going to much you can lose so if there's going to be< be a market crash the simplest way to be a market crash the simplest way to protect< protect against this market crash would protect against this market crash would be< be buying a put option however buying a be buying a put option however buying a put< put option can be quite expensive so as put option can be quite expensive so as you< you can see over here it cost you on spy you can see over here it cost you on spy about about about $189< $189 which is about 1,1 $89 so if I was $189. which is about 1,1 $89 so if I was to< to hover over here you can see the max to hover over here you can see the max loss< loss down here is about loss down here is about $1,192< $1,192 right so give and take around $1,192 right so give and take around this< this price so that means to say if the this price so that means to say if the market< market doesn't crash it goes up then you market doesn't crash it goes up then you lose< lose about ,000 plus dollars at the end lose about ,000 plus dollars at the end of< of this uh 45 days for this uh DTE of this uh 45 days for this uh DTE interval< interval so this is actually quite a interval so this is actually quite a hefty< hefty amount but if you think you know hefty amount but if you think you know it's< it's a good amount to pay to protect you it's a good amount to pay to protect you on< on the downside then by all means you on the downside then by all means you can< can use this strategy but you just just can use this strategy but you just just need< need to know that this is for every 45 need to know that this is for every 45 days< days that means if the market doesn't days that means if the market doesn't crash< crash in the next 45 days you're going crash in the next 45 days you're going to< to pretty much lose this money if the to pretty much lose this money if the market< market goes above this strike price now market goes above this strike price now the< the other way that you can actually the other way that you can actually protect< protect for a longer time period is to protect for a longer time period is to go< go for the longer dated options so for go for the longer dated options so for example< example you can go one that is about example you can go one that is about let's< let's say 367 days out which is about a let's say 367 days out which is about a year< year out now if you were to protect your year out now if you were to protect your portfolio< portfolio about a year out with a put portfolio about a year out with a put option< option you can see that it starts to get option you can see that it starts to get even< even more expensive right so if I was to even more expensive right so if I was to buy< buy this oops let me just cancel the buy this oops let me just cancel the previous< previous one so let me just delete this previous one so let me just delete this you< you can see that this cost you about you can see that this cost you about $30. 45< $30.

45 so that is about $30. 45 so that is about $3,000< $3,000 for this put option so it is $3,000 for this put option so it is quite< quite expensive as well so the other way quite expensive as well so the other way is< is by buying a put debit spread so let is by buying a put debit spread so let me< me just go back down to the 45 DTE again me just go back down to the 45 DTE again so< so let me just open up this option chain so let me just open up this option chain so< so instead of buying a put option out so instead of buying a put option out right< right what you can actually do is to right what you can actually do is to sell< sell a put option further out of the sell a put option further out of the money< money so this way at least you make it money so this way at least you make it cheaper< cheaper so let's say for example we go cheaper so let's say for example we go for< for a 10o wide put debit spread so what for a 10o wide put debit spread so what you're< you're going to do is you just sell the you're going to do is you just sell the put< put option down here and here you have a put option down here and here you have a 10o< 10o wide put debit spread which is going 10o wide put debit spread which is going to< to cost you much lesser than a put to cost you much lesser than a put option< option so as you can see over here it option so as you can see over here it only< only cost you only cost you $337< $337 which means to say your max loss is $337 which means to say your max loss is about< about $300 plus doar right as you can about $300 plus doar right as you can see< see on the right hand side the max loss see on the right hand side the max loss is< is 300 $37 so it is going to be slightly is 300 $37 so it is going to be slightly more< more cheaper compared to buying a put more cheaper compared to buying a put option< option but the drawback of this put option but the drawback of this put debit< debit spread is that if the market debit spread is that if the market actually< actually goes past this point so as you actually goes past this point so as you can< can see down here this is where we sold can see down here this is where we sold the< the put option so this is our strike the put option so this is our strike price< price somewhere at uh 573 so if the price somewhere at uh 573 so if the market< market actually goes past this point at market actually goes past this point at expiration< expiration then you're not going to make expiration then you're not going to make much< much more than what you already have much more than what you already have gotten< gotten at this point because you have gotten at this point because you have already< already sold the put option down here already sold the put option down here and< and these kinds of already kepts The Mex and these kinds of already kepts The Mex that< that you can make so this is for the put that you can make so this is for the put debit< debit spread so both are very viable and debit spread so both are very viable and both< both are actually a way that you can both are actually a way that you can hatch< hatch a portfolio in case the market hatch a portfolio in case the market actually< actually goes down now one of the things actually goes down now one of the things to< to understand is if you are planning to to understand is if you are planning to do< do this strategy on spy you need to do this strategy on spy you need to realize< realize that spy is actually what you realize that spy is actually what you call< call a positive drift vehicle which call a positive drift vehicle which means< means to say over the long term the means to say over the long term the market< market wants to go up so if I was to go market wants to go up so if I was to go back< back to spy you can see that spy has back to spy you can see that spy has always< always been making new highs right as always been making new highs right as you< you can see that uh spy has been seped you can see that uh spy has been seped for< for many many years and over time it for many many years and over time it just< just kept making new highs and if you just kept making new highs and if you were< were to see the statistics the market were to see the statistics the market actually< actually goes up more of the time than actually goes up more of the time than it< it go down so that means to say that if it go down so that means to say that if you< you were to consistently use the put you were to consistently use the put option< option strategy or to use the put debit option strategy or to use the put debit spread< spread over time this can be considered spread over time this can be considered a< a losing proposition because the market a losing proposition because the market keeps< keeps going up so when you're paying for keeps going up so when you're paying for this< this strategies like the put option and this strategies like the put option and the< the put debit uh spread and the market the put debit uh spread and the market actually< actually doesn't go down then you're actually doesn't go down then you're actually< actually going to lose money so what are actually going to lose money so what are the< the ways that you can work around this the ways that you can work around this so< so one way that you can work around this so one way that you can work around this is< is to actually Finance the purchase of is to actually Finance the purchase of this< this strategy with another option so in this strategy with another option so in this< this uh options world we call this this uh options world we call this financing< financing so there are a few ways that financing so there are a few ways that you< you can do the financing so if let's say you can do the financing so if let's say for< for example you want to purchase this for example you want to purchase this put< put debit spread that's put debit spread that's $337< $337 but you want to use another option $337 but you want to use another option to< to finance this then one way that you to finance this then one way that you can< can do is simply sell a put option to can do is simply sell a put option to finance< finance the purchase of this put deit finance the purchase of this put deit spread< spread so right now as you can see the spread so right now as you can see the cost< cost of this put debit spread is cost of this put debit. spread is $337< $337 so what you can do is you can go to $337 so what you can do is you can go to the< the put option that is further out of the put option that is further out of the< the money and then find the put option the money and then find the put option that< that is roughly around this price so that is roughly around this price so let's< let's say for example I was to go for let's say for example I was to go for this< this one down here 544 strike price and this one down here 544 strike price and I< I was to sell this put option what will I was to sell this put option what will happen< happen is that now I will receive $341 happen is that now I will receive $341 in< in terms of credit and then I use it to in terms of credit and then I use it to purchase< purchase the put debit spread and I purchase the put debit spread and I still< still have a spillover of 5 cents that still have a spillover of 5 cents that means< means now I have a 5 cents credit for means now I have a 5 cents credit for putting< putting on this strategy so if you were putting on this strategy so if you were to< to take a look at the p&amp;l graph down to take a look at the p&amp;l graph down here< here you will see that it has this here you will see that it has this structure< structure over here so on the right hand structure over here so on the right hand side< side what you essentially have is the side what you essentially have is the put< put debit spread but you notice now that put debit spread but you notice now that is< is no loss to the downside down here is no loss to the downside down here there's< there's no loss previously there was there's no loss previously there was this< this uh Zone down here here where it's this uh Zone down here here where it's in< in the rate but now it's no longer there in the rate but now it's no longer there so< so let me just remove this and it's no so let me just remove this and it's no longer< longer there because you use this short longer there because you use this short put< put at the bottom which is at 544 to put at the bottom which is at 544 to purchase< purchase this so right now if the market purchase this so right now if the market goes< goes up then no longer is a loss because goes up then no longer is a loss because everything< everything has been paid for by this everything has been paid for by this short< short putut so in the event if the short putut so in the event if the market< market doesn't actually go down and it market doesn't actually go down and it continues< continues to go up then there is no loss continues to go up then there is no loss to< to you now although you have already to you now although you have already financed< financed the purchase of this put debit financed the purchase of this put debit spread< spread you also need to understand that spread you also need to understand that now< now there's still some risk to the now there's still some risk to the downside< downside so as you can see over here downside so as you can see over here past< past this break even point at expiration past this break even point at expiration you're< you're going to start to lose money so you're going to start to lose money so this< this is one of the trade-offs of using this is one of the trade-offs of using the< the financing option so if you're the financing option so if you're financing< financing with the short putut although financing with the short putut although there's< there's now no risk to the upside you there's now no risk to the upside you have< have now shifted the risk to the have now shifted the risk to the downside< downside so let's say for example there downside so let's say for example there really< really is a market crash and let's just really is a market crash and let's just say< say the market crash is very severe and say the market crash is very severe and it< it goes all the way past your break even it goes all the way past your break even point< point expiration then this is where you point expiration then this is where you can< can start to lose money so while the can start to lose money so while the market< market can come down you can profit in market can come down you can profit in this< this Zone down here we just don't want this Zone down here we just don't want it< it to go too far down so this is where it to go too far down so this is where you< you can also strategically pick your you can also strategically pick your strike< strike price down here so let's say for strike price down here so let's say for example< example let me just remove all these example let me just remove all these drawings< drawings and remove all this uh strikes drawings and remove all this uh strikes as< as well so let's just say for example as well so let's just say for example you< you choose the $10 strike price right if you choose the $10 strike price right if you< you choose a $10 strike price it just you choose a $10 strike price it just means< means that the market has about a 10% means that the market has about a 10% chance< chance of it going past this strike chance of it going past this strike price< price at expiration that means to say price at expiration that means to say 90%< 90% of the time it will be above this 90% of the time it will be above this strike< strike price so if you feel comfortable strike price so if you feel comfortable with< with this strike price and the with this strike price and the probability< probability that you will stay above the probability that you will stay above the strike< strike price what you can do is use this strike price what you can do is use this short< short putut to finance a put debit short putut to finance a put debit spread< spread so from here what you can do is spread so from here what you can do is you< you can choose a debit spread of at the you can choose a debit spread of at the money< money so what you're going to do is money so what you're going to do is you're< you're going to buy this strike price you're going to buy this strike price and< and let's just see how wide of a put and let's just see how wide of a put debit< debit spread that you can go for uh debit spread that you can go for uh where< where you can still get an overall where you can still get an overall positive< positive credit so let's take a look at positive credit so let's take a look at three< three point wi first so you can see it three point wi first so you can see it says< says minus 1.

24 which means to say you says minus 1. 24 which means to say you actually< actually still have a positive credit on actually still have a positive credit on the< the upside so in the event whereby the the upside so in the event whereby the market< market does not go down and it goes up market does not go down and it goes up you< you still get some profits which is in you still get some profits which is in the< the form of this credit and let's say if the form of this credit and let's say if the< the market actually goes down and you're the market actually goes down and you're right< right that it does stay within this right that it does stay within this profit< profit zone right and it's within the profit zone right and it's within the 90%< 90% of the time roughly 90% of the time 90% of the time roughly 90% of the time it< it stay is above your short put strike it stay is above your short put strike then< then you're going to be in a profit as then you're going to be in a profit as well< well so in a sense this strategy can well so in a sense this strategy can actually< actually kind of have an hatch to the actually kind of have an hatch to the downside< downside and protect your portfolio to a downside and protect your portfolio to a certain< certain extent right it can protect your certain extent right it can protect your portfolio< portfolio to the point of that strike portfolio to the point of that strike price< price again remember when we are trading price again remember when we are trading options< options we are trading probability so options we are trading probability so when< when we are trading probabilities this when we are trading probabilities this is< is where you know taking a look at the is where you know taking a look at the Delta< Delta can really help because it gives Delta can really help because it gives us< us an idea what is the percentage chance us an idea what is the percentage chance of< of the strike price actually being of the strike price actually being bridged< bridged at exper expiration so if it bridged at exper expiration so if it says< says 10 Delta it just means about 10% uh says 10 Delta it just means about 10% uh that< that it will go past this strike price that it will go past this strike price at< at expiration now what if you're not at expiration now what if you're not comfortable< comfortable with this short putut comfortable with this short putut because< because short put can be a very big loss because short put can be a very big loss to< to the downside basically unlimited to the downside basically unlimited losses< losses all the way down to zero but you. losses all the way down to zero but you also< also still want to have a way to finance also still want to have a way to finance the< the purchase of the put devage spread the purchase of the put devage spread well< well this is where you can turn this well this is where you can turn this short< short putut into a put credit spread so short putut into a put credit spread so with< with the put credit spread you're again with the put credit spread you're again going< going to receive some sort of credit and going to receive some sort of credit and with< with this credit you can then use to with this credit you can then use to purchase< purchase the put debit spread so how you purchase the put debit spread so how you want< want to do this similar as well so let want to do this similar as well so let me< me just remove all this uh strikes first me just remove all this uh strikes first so< so let's just say at this point of time so let's just say at this point of time maybe< maybe you're very confident that uh it maybe you're very confident that uh it won't< won't go past maybe the 20 Delta strike won't go past maybe the 20 Delta strike price< price so that means to say you're okay price so that means to say you're okay with< with the fact that 80% of the time it's with the fact that 80% of the time it's going< going to be in a profit and 20% of time going to be in a profit and 20% of time there's< there's going to be a loss so let's say there's going to be a loss so let's say for< for example we choose 5 54 what we can for example we choose 5 54 what we can do< do is maybe you can stretch it to about do is maybe you can stretch it to about let's< let's say 10 points wi in this case so let's say 10 points wi in this case so if< if you stretch to 10 points WIP you're if you stretch to 10 points WIP you're going< going to receive a credit of about a120 going to receive a credit of about a120 now< now with this you can use to purchase now with this you can use to purchase the< the put debit spread so let's say for the put debit spread so let's say for example< example uh I'm going to choose maybe 1 example uh I'm going to choose maybe 1 point< point Y and see what we get okay so as point Y and see what we get okay so as you< you can see down here if you purchase a you can see down here if you purchase a put< put debit spread that's 1.

white then put debit spread that's 1. white then it's< it's going to be very similar to the it's going to be very similar to the structure< structure You' seen earlier but then structure You' seen earlier but then down< down here you have a limited loss as you down here you have a limited loss as you can< can see your loss is kept to 819 so in can see your loss is kept to 819 so in the< the event whereby you know it doesn't the event whereby you know it doesn't stay< stay within this profit Zone this Max stay within this profit Zone this Max profit< profit Zone and the market actually profit Zone and the market actually crashes< crashes then one thing at least you will crashes then one thing at least you will feel< feel not too worried about is that you feel not too worried about is that you already< already have your max loss kept at this already have your max loss kept at this point< point so if your max loss is at let's point so if your max loss is at let's say< say this point say this point $89< $89 even though the underlying goes to $89 even though the underlying goes to zero< zero you don't have to worry because zero you don't have to worry because you're< you're not going to lose all that have you're not going to lose all that have in< in your account the only amount you're in your account the only amount you're going< going to lose is what you risk for this going to lose is what you risk for this trade< trade so if you're not comfortable with trade so if you're not comfortable with the< the undefined risk version of this the undefined risk version of this strategy< strategy you can go for the defined risk strategy you can go for the defined risk version< version of this strategy now what if version of this strategy now what if you're< you're the kind of person whereby you do you're the kind of person whereby you do want< want to go for the undefined one you are want to go for the undefined one you are a< a little bit more aggressive in your a little bit more aggressive in your risk< risk but you feel that you know the risk but you feel that you know the earlier< earlier strike price that we chose the earlier strike price that we chose the 10< 10 Delta one is still a little bit too 10 Delta one is still a little bit too near< near where the current market price is near where the current market price is you< you want to go one that is super far out you want to go one that is super far out the< the mark money right so I'm sure you the mark money right so I'm sure you have< have seen some of those videos whereby have seen some of those videos whereby people< people go very very far out of the money people go very very far out of the money whereby< whereby they think that the chances of whereby they think that the chances of getting< getting hit is going to be very low so getting hit is going to be very low so first< first of all I don't really like this first of all I don't really like this strategy< strategy but I just want to just share strategy but I just want to just share with< with you because this is something that with you because this is something that some< some people have actually done so what some people have actually done so what they< they did is that they will choose an they did is that they will choose an option< option strike price that is super far option strike price that is super far out< out of the money so let's say for out of the money so let's say for example< example we choose one that is maybe example we choose one that is maybe around< around 480 so that is uh three Delta so around 480 so that is uh three Delta so that< that means to say there's only a 3% that means to say there's only a 3% chance< chance of the market going past this chance of the market going past this strike< strike price at expiration so what they strike price at expiration so what they do< do is this so if you can see this if you do is this so if you can see this if you were< were to sell just one put option you're were to sell just one put option you're only< only getting 82 cents and 82 cents is only getting 82 cents and 82 cents is not< not that much because if you want to not that much because if you want to construct< construct the uh put debit spread maybe construct the uh put debit spread maybe uh< uh you may not have that wide of a put uh you may not have that wide of a put debit< debit spread so for example if I was to debit spread so for example if I was to construct< construct this put debit spread you can construct this put debit spread you can see< see that I only can get a two points see that I only can get a two points wide< wide and then the risk reward down here wide and then the risk reward down here is< is not really not that good because is not really not that good because what's< what's happening down here is that you what's happening down here is that you are< are only going to get a Max profit about are only going to get a Max profit about $25< $25 but your loss is going to be super $25 but. your loss is going to be super big< big as you can see if the market big as you can see if the market continues< continues to go down it goes past the uh continues to go down it goes past the uh strike< strike price which you have down here so strike price which you have down here so what< what some people actually do is that what some people actually do is that they< they want to increase this put debit they want to increase this put debit spread< spread but in exchange to tradeoff what spread but in exchange to tradeoff what they< they do is they sell multiple contracts they do is they sell multiple contracts of< of this put option so let's say for of this put option so let's say for example< example if I sell two contracts of this example if I sell two contracts of this 480< 480 now I'm going to have more credit 480 now I'm going to have more credit and< and with this more credit I can purchase and with this more credit I can purchase a< a bigger debit spread so as you can see a bigger debit spread so as you can see I< I still have additional 88 cents in I still have additional 88 cents in terms< terms of credit maybe I can stretch it terms of credit maybe I can stretch it about< about four points wide or maybe even about four points wide or maybe even Five< Five Points wide can we do Five Points Five Points wide can we do Five Points no< no we can't do Five Points so we can no we can't do Five Points so we can only< only do about uh Four Points how many only do about uh Four Points how many points< points is this 5792 583 yeah it's about points is this 5792 583 yeah it's about four< four points out so as you can see your four points out so as you can see your max< max profit is higher but again you take max profit is higher but again you take more< more risk to the downside so in case by more risk to the downside so in case by now< now if you haven't realized this is now if you haven't realized this is actually< actually a pretty pretty popular actually a pretty pretty popular strategy< strategy amongst a lot of the Traders strategy amongst a lot of the Traders which< which is What's called the 112 strategy which is What's called the 112 strategy so< so the 112 strategy is pretty much so the 112 strategy is pretty much crafted< crafted this way where you sell two put crafted this way where you sell two put options< options to finance the purchase of One options to finance the purchase of One debit< debit spread so I personally do not debit spread so I personally do not really< really like this strategy because a really like this strategy because a little< little bit too risky for me especially little bit too risky for me especially on< on the downside whereby if the market on the downside whereby if the market actually< actually does crash I'm not comfortable actually does crash I'm not comfortable with< with the loss on the downside so for me with the loss on the downside so for me the< the most I would go if I want to use the most I would go if I want to use this< this strategy I'll probably just use one this strategy I'll probably just use one shop< shop putut where it's at least closer to shop putut where it's at least closer to where< where the current market price is where the current market price is compared< compared to the two contracts that's compared to the two contracts that's further< further out okay so this really comes further out okay so this really comes down< down to your own risk preference and you down to your own risk preference and you have< have to decide for yourself which one have to decide for yourself which one you< you feel more comfortable now there's you feel more comfortable now there's one< one more strategy that I want to share one more strategy that I want to share with< with you that can really help protect with you that can really help protect your< your portfolio to the downside your portfolio to the downside especially< especially if you really have some especially if you really have some existing< existing shares in your portfolio and existing shares in your portfolio and that< that is with the strategy that's called that is with the strategy that's called the< the Coller so if you're not familiar the Coller so if you're not familiar with< with the CER basically first of all the with the CER basically first of all the criteria< criteria is that you do need to have a criteria is that you do need to have a 100< 100 shares of the underlying so let's 100 shares of the underlying so let's say< say for example I have a 100 shares on say for example I have a 100 shares on spy< spy what I'm going to do is I'm first spy what I'm going to do is I'm first going< going to sell a covered call so let's going to sell a covered call so let's just< just say for example I want to sell the just say for example I want to sell the covered< covered call at 590 now once I've covered call at 590 now once I've already< already sold this cover call as you can already sold this cover call as you can see< see over here I'm going to receive a see over here I'm going to receive a credit< credit of about credit of about $99.

96< $99. 96 and if you've learned anything $99.

96 and if you've learned anything from< from this video so far and that is the. from this video so far and that is the concept< concept of financing so with this $9. 94 concept of financing so with this $9.

94 I< I received receives as credit I can I received receives as credit I can actually< actually use it to finance the purchase actually use it to finance the purchase of< of a put option to help. me protect my of a put option to help me protect my portfolio< portfolio or the underlying to the portfolio or the underlying to the downside< downside so since I received about downside so since I received about $99. 96< $99.

96 I want to find the put option $99. 96 I want to find the put option that< that is roughly around this same price that is roughly around this same price as< as well so as. you can see I can purchase as well so as you can see I can purchase this< this 577 strike price for this 577 strike price for $9.

#### Topic 1

75< $9. 75 so when you do it this way what $9.

75 so when you do it this way what happens< happens is that if the market actually happens is that if the market actually crashes< crashes let's say the market goes all crashes let's say the market goes all the< the way past the way past 577< 577 you will actually not lose more than 577 you will actually not lose more than this< this strike price that you have already this strike price that you have already bought< bought down here this put option down bought down here this put option down here< here because it has already limited your here because it has already limited your downside< downside so this is where you really downside so this is where you really don't< don't have to worry about a market crash don't have to worry about a market crash because< because you are kind of already because you are kind of already protected< protected to the downside quite a bit protected to the downside quite a bit now< now there's a drawback to this strategy now there's a drawback to this strategy because< because it's always a trade-off because because it's always a trade-off because remember< remember you have this covered call down remember you have this covered call down here< here that means to say if the stock here that means to say if the stock actually< actually does not go down and it's actually does not go down and it's starts< starts to go up and maybe it even Ries starts to go up and maybe it even Ries it< it Ries all the way up maybe P to 600 it Ries all the way up maybe P to 600 plus< plus over dollars well guess what you plus over dollars well guess what you won't< won't be able to participate in the up won't be able to participate in the up move< move because you've already kept move because you've already kept yourself< yourself with this covered call down yourself with this covered call down here< here now of course you can keep rolling here now of course you can keep rolling and< and rolling up and. out each time you're and rolling up and out each time you're being< being uh tested but there's going to be being uh tested but there's going to be a< a limit to how far you can actually roll a limit to how far you can actually roll but< but with that said the caller can but with that said the caller can actually< actually be a very helpful strategy actually be a very helpful strategy especially< especially if you're worried about a especially if you're worried about a market< market crash so if you're worried about market crash so if you're worried about the< the market going down or even a market the market going down or even a market crash< crash then you can consider using some crash then you can consider using some of< of the strategies I've shared in this of the strategies I've shared in this video< video remember we do not want to predict video remember we do not want to predict where< where the market is going but instead we where the market is going but instead we want< want to just prepare our portfolio in want to just prepare our portfolio in the< the event that actually happen so this the event that actually happen so this way< way if the market really crash you way if the market really crash you already< already have some positions in your already have some positions in your portfolio< portfolio that can help you capture the portfolio that can help you capture the move< move to the down site and protect your move to the down site and protect your portfolio< portfolio I hope you found this video portfolio I hope you found this video helpful< helpful and if you have I would greatly helpful and if you have I would greatly appreciate< appreciate if you give me a thumbs up on appreciate if you give me a thumbs up on this< this video and also subscribe for more this video and also subscribe for more videos< videos like this and I will see you in videos like this and I will see you in the<

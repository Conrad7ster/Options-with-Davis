Language: en hey< hey welcome to part two of this video hey welcome to part two of this video series< series on how to repair a losing stock series on how to repair a losing stock position< position using options now if you position using options now if you haven't< haven't already watched part one i would haven't already watched part one i would suggest< suggest that you go and watch the video suggest that you go and watch the video first< first because in that video i talked first because in that video i talked about< about what exactly repairing a losing about what exactly repairing a losing stock< stock position means so that will set stock position means so that will set the< the grounding for this video so if you the grounding for this video so if you haven't< haven't already watched it just go to haven't already watched it just go to the< the top right hand corner of this video the top right hand corner of this video and< and you can click the video to watch and you can click the video to watch that< that first but if you've already watched that first but if you've already watched it< it then in this part two i'll share with it then in this part two i'll share with you< you the remaining two strategies for you you the remaining two strategies for you to< to repair losing stock positions and the to repair losing stock positions and the second< second method is the put ratio spread so second method is the put ratio spread so what< what is the put ratio spread now the put what is the put ratio spread now the put ratio< ratio spread just very simply means to ratio spread just very simply means to buy< buy one put option which is normally at buy one put option which is normally at the< the money or slightly out of money so the money or slightly out of money so imagine< imagine this is where the market is imagine this is where the market is right< right now so you will buy one put option right now so you will buy one put option and< and then you will sell two put options and then you will sell two put options that's< that's further out of the money and you that's further out of the money and you can< can see this ratio is where can see this ratio is where there's< there's one and this is two so this is there's one and this is two so this is where< where you get the ratio whereas one is where you get the ratio whereas one is to< to two now you can also do a one is to to two now you can also do a one is to three< three put ratio that means you'll be three put ratio that means you'll be buying< buying one put option and selling three buying one put option and selling three put< put options or buying two put options or buying two put< put options and selling three put put options and selling three put options< options all right so options all right so there's< there's a lot of ways that you can there's a lot of ways that you can change< change the ratio that is why it's called change the ratio that is why it's called a< a ratio spread but for the purpose of a ratio spread but for the purpose of this< this video this video we're< we're only going to be focusing on the we're only going to be focusing on the ones< ones two and i suggest that you do that ones two and i suggest that you do that as< as well because this is much simpler and as well because this is much simpler and more< more strict for you more straightforward more strict for you more straightforward to< to understand so basically a ratio to understand so basically a ratio spread< spread a put ratio spread is where spread a put ratio spread is where you're< you're using put options and with a you're using put options and with a ratio ratio ratio that< that is either one is two or more now that is either one is two or more now you< you can see here that we are selling two you can see here that we are selling two put< put options so this can be quite put options so this can be quite confusing< confusing and scary to some people so confusing and scary to some people so instead< instead of seeing the put ratio this way instead of seeing the put ratio this way the< the better way that i would prefer to the better way that i would prefer to see< see a put ratio is basically that it see a put ratio is basically that it consists< consists of two option strategies and consists of two option strategies and when< when you combine these two it becomes when you combine these two it becomes the< the put ratio spread so first of all the the put ratio spread so first of all the first< first portion of the put ratio spread is first portion of the put ratio spread is simply< simply just a bare put spread right a simply just a bare put spread right a bad< bad put spread is a bearish strategy bad put spread is a bearish strategy where< where you are hoping the market drops where you are hoping the market drops right< right the market goes down and that's right the market goes down and that's where< where you make your money and it is a where you make your money and it is a debit< debit vertical spread that means you're debit vertical spread that means you're paying< paying for it paying for it so< so as you can see let's say this is the so as you can see let's say this is the market< market right now so buying a bad put market right now so buying a bad put spread< spread basically just means you are spread basically just means you are buying< buying uh at the money or slightly out buying uh at the money or slightly out of< of the money are put and then you're of the money are put and then you're selling< selling a further away put now this will selling a further away put now this will always< always cost more than this that is why always cost more than this that is why you're< you're paying more to buy this and then you're paying more to buy this and then when< when you sell this you receive lesser when you sell this you receive lesser and< and that is why it's a debit so and that is why it's a debit so what< what we want to do is to finance this what we want to do is to finance this bear< bear put spread with the second bear put spread with the second component< component which is a cash secure output component which is a cash secure output so< so a cash secure put is where you so a cash secure put is where you receive< receive a credit receive a credit for< for selling this for selling this put< put option so ideally what we want is to put option so ideally what we want is to sell< sell this and receive the credit that is sell this and receive the credit that is more< more than what we paid to buy this bare more than what we paid to buy this bare put< put spread so for example if we bought put spread so for example if we bought the< the bare put spread for a dollar the bare put spread for a dollar what< what we ideally want is to sell the what we ideally want is to sell the cashing< cashing output for more than a dollar cashing output for more than a dollar right< right it could be a dollar and five right it could be a dollar and five cents< cents a dollar and 10 cents this way we cents a dollar and 10 cents this way we get< get the bare put spread for free that get the bare put spread for free that means< means that anything means that anything that< that goes below here will be a profit that goes below here will be a profit for< for us and even though if the market for us and even though if the market goes< goes up we wouldn't lose any money at goes up we wouldn't lose any money at all< all because this is a credit spread all all because this is a credit spread all together< together right so together right so imagine< imagine this if we receive a dollar and imagine this if we receive a dollar and 10< 10 cents for this 10 cents for this and< and we paid and we paid one< one dollar for this one dollar for this minus< minus one dollar minus one dollar our< our total our total will< will become. a credit will become a credit of of of 10< 10 cents 10 cents right right right but< but if you only bought this barefoot but if you only bought this barefoot spread< spread and if the market decides to go spread and if the market decides to go up up up right< right then you would have lost one right then you would have lost one dollar< dollar at expiration date if it closes dollar at expiration date if it closes above above above your< your bad put spread but because we have your bad put spread but because we have this< this credit down here that is helping to this credit down here that is helping to finance< finance the purchase of this even though finance the purchase of this even though if< if the market goes up we now no longer if the market goes up we now no longer lose< lose money because we have a credit of lose money because we have a credit of 10< 10 cents which is 10 per option contract 10 cents which is 10 per option contract right< right so that is why we want to always right so that is why we want to always route< route a put ratio for a credit now the route a put ratio for a credit now the put< put ratio spread in general is a neutral put ratio spread in general is a neutral to< to bearish strategy that means that we to bearish strategy that means that we want< want the market to go down want the market to go down right< right so ideally right so ideally as< as a repair strategy what we want is to as a repair strategy what we want is to get< get fuel at the price where we sold our get fuel at the price where we sold our cash< cash secure output cash secure output so< so we want the market to actually go so we want the market to actually go down< down here we wanted to go past our cash down here we wanted to go past our cash output< output and expire below this put this output and expire below this put this way< way what will happen is that we will way what will happen is that we will receive< receive the max profit on this bull put receive the max profit on this bull put spread< spread right we will make the full spread right we will make the full profit< profit here because profit here because this< this brand makes money as the market this brand makes money as the market goes< goes down so if it goes down and closes goes down so if it goes down and closes below below below we< we will take the full profit of this and we will take the full profit of this and that< that leaves our cash secure output and that leaves our cash secure output and this< this cash output would be exercised and this cash output would be exercised and we< we will now be long 100 shares at this we will now be long 100 shares at this level< level now if you did not sell this put level now if you did not sell this put ratio< ratio spread and you were to just place ratio spread and you were to just place a< a buy limit order to buy a hundred a buy limit order to buy a hundred shares< shares here shares here all< all you would have is just all you would have is just you< you will be long once the price goes you will be long once the price goes below< below this level you will be along 100 below this level you will be along 100 shares< shares but you wouldn't have any profits shares but you wouldn't have any profits but< but with the put ratio we would have but with the put ratio we would have already< already made profits from the bare put already made profits from the bare put spread< spread so that is why a put ratio spread spread so that is why a put ratio spread is< is fantastic way for you to go long a is fantastic way for you to go long a stock< stock especially if you want to stock especially if you want to hold< hold it as an investment for the long hold it as an investment for the long term term term so< so i'm going to give you a visual so i'm going to give you a visual demonstration< demonstration illustration just to show demonstration illustration just to show you< you how it works so you how it works so imagine< imagine you are long 100 shares right imagine you are long 100 shares right this< this is disney you have bought 100 this is disney you have bought 100 shares< shares at 110 and now the market is shares at 110 and now the market is really< really dropping and in a bear market and really dropping and in a bear market and when< when the market is crashing you will when the market is crashing you will face face face you< you will face this quite a bit because you will face this quite a bit because most< most of the time most of your positions most of the time most of your positions will< will be up here will be up here so< so now that you have long 110 you decide so now that you have long 110 you decide that< that hey i want to repair that hey i want to repair my< my stock position so what you want to my stock position so what you want to first< first do is identify the level which you first do is identify the level which you want< want to buy it so in this case let's say want to buy it so in this case let's say we< we want to buy 85 which is quite a fair we want to buy 85 which is quite a fair bit< bit away from 110 bit away from 110 so so so instead< instead of just placing a buy limit instead of just placing a buy limit order< order what we do is we are going to sell order what we do is we are going to sell a< a put ratio spread a put ratio spread so< so as you can see this is a put ratio so as you can see this is a put ratio spread< spread so again spread so again we< we are buying one put which is 92 we are buying one put which is 92 dollars< dollars so this is just slightly further dollars so this is just slightly further out< out of the money right from the market out of the money right from the market 92< 92 down here and then we're going to 92 down here and then we're going to sell< sell two sell two puts< puts at 85 which is the price we want to puts at 85 which is the price we want to go< go long at so remember again it is go long at so remember again it is basically< basically a bad put spread and one cash basically a bad put spread and one cash secure< secure output so this spread will make secure output so this spread will make money< money when the market goes down so money when the market goes down so anywhere< anywhere below 92 dollars is where we anywhere below 92 dollars is where we will< will make our money and if it goes below will make our money and if it goes below 85< 85 on top of making the profits here we 85 on top of making the profits here we will< will be long 85 will be long 85 100< 100 shares at 85 dollars in expiration 100 shares at 85 dollars in expiration all< all right so let's take a look at a few all right so let's take a look at a few scenarios< scenarios that can happen at expiration scenarios that can happen at expiration so< so let's say an expiration so let's say an expiration disney< disney is above 92 dollars right it disney is above 92 dollars right it could< could be here it could be there could be here it could be there right< right if it goes above 92 dollars what right if it goes above 92 dollars what it< it just means is that our put ratio it just means is that our put ratio expires< expires worthless and we get to keep the expires worthless and we get to keep the full< full five cents credit now you times full five cents credit now you times this< this by 100 shares that is five dollars this by 100 shares that is five dollars that< that is not a lot but it's at least that is not a lot but it's at least something< something right something right so< so this will bring our average price so this will bring our average price down down down per< per share to 109. 95 per share to 109.

95 now< now this is if it expires above 92 now this is if it expires above 92 dollars< dollars which is not too bad as well dollars which is not too bad as well because< because it means that our existing because it means that our existing position< position doesn't actually lose that much position doesn't actually lose that much so< so we kind of have zoned out or rather so we kind of have zoned out or rather boxed< boxed out our price in the sense whereby boxed out our price in the sense whereby if< if it goes up it's not so bad for our if it goes up it's not so bad for our existing< existing position if it goes down we existing position if it goes down we make< make money on our spread as well make money on our spread as well so< so let's take a look at scenario two so so let's take a look at scenario two so let's< let's say at expiration disney is in let's say at expiration disney is in between< between 92 dollars to 85 dollars so this between 92 dollars to 85 dollars so this is< is the zone is the zone where< where we start to make money with our where we start to make money with our spread spread spread so so so how< how much we make really is dependent and how much we make really is dependent and where< where it closes at expiration date all where it closes at expiration date all right< right so let's say it closes at 90 right so let's say it closes at 90 at< at expiration date so that's two dollars at expiration date so that's two dollars below< below the put that we bought below the put that we bought so< so in this case our profit would be the so in this case our profit would be the five< five cents that we've already collected five cents that we've already collected plus< plus the difference between the put plus the difference between the put spread< spread that we bought and where it spread that we bought and where it closed< closed at so it will be 92 minus 90 closed at so it will be 92 minus 90 so< so a total will be two dollars five so a total will be two dollars five cents< cents times a hundred shares that is cents times a hundred shares that is total< total of 205 dollars so we made 205 total of 205 dollars. so we made 205 dollars< dollars and at this point this uh put dollars and at this point this uh put ratio< ratio would have x uh would be ratio would have x uh would be expired< expired the cash output would have expired the cash output would have expired< expired worthless so when this happens expired worthless so when this happens our< our average price right now becomes a our average price right now becomes a hundred< hundred and seven dollars and 95 cents hundred and seven dollars and 95 cents and< and we are not even long yet at 85 and we are not even long yet at 85 because< because it did not breach our put at 85 because it did not breach our put at 85 strike< strike so what happens here is that we strike so what happens here is that we can< can just sell another ratio spread you can just sell another ratio spread you try< try and collect more premiums again try and collect more premiums again as< as the market drops or if the market as the market drops or if the market goes< goes up it doesn't matter to us we will goes up it doesn't matter to us we will still< still try and collect still try and collect some< some money as the market moves right some money as the market moves right now< now what if the market closes at 87 now what if the market closes at 87 then< then similarly then similarly first< first of all we will collect the five first of all we will collect the five cents< cents in credit and then we will take cents in credit and then we will take the< the difference between ninety two the difference between ninety two dollars< dollars and where close that at eighty dollars and where close that at eighty seven< seven and in this case will be five seven and in this case will be five dollars< dollars and five cents and that is a dollars and five cents and that is a total< total of five hundred five dollars that total of five hundred five dollars that we< we get to keep right we get a keep and we get to keep right we get a keep and we< we do not even have this uh put option we do not even have this uh put option exercise exercise exercise so< so this brings our average price right so this brings our average price right now< now to now to 104. 95< 104.

95 cents i will put uh cash secure 104. 95 cents i will put uh cash secure output< output expired worthless so what we can output expired worthless so what we can do< do is again sell another put ratio or do is again sell another put ratio or maybe< maybe if you prefer you could sell cash maybe if you prefer you could sell cash secure< secure put secure put now< now let's take a look at scenario three now let's take a look at scenario three now< now what happens at scenario three is if now what happens at scenario three is if this< this need was to close below 85 and this this need was to close below 85 and this is< is where our cash secure output is so is where our cash secure output is so when< when this happens when this happens our< our profit will be the full profit of our profit will be the full profit of this< this vertical spread that we saw the this vertical spread that. we saw the bare< bare put spread which is a total of bare put spread which is a total of seven< seven points from ninety two dollars to seven points from ninety two dollars to eighty< eighty five dollars so we were making up eighty five dollars so we were making up we'll< we'll be making a profit of five cents we'll be making a profit of five cents plus< plus seven dollars total of seven plus seven dollars total of seven dollars< dollars five cent times 100 shares that dollars five cent times 100 shares that is is is 705< 705 dollars and when that happens 705 dollars and when that happens we< we will also be long in the 100 shares we will also be long in the 100 shares at< at 85 because now our cash output gets at 85 because now our cash output gets exercised< exercised so in this case our average exercised so in this case our average price< price now becomes 93.

98 price now becomes 93. 98 basically< basically you just take 110 basically you just take 110 plus< plus the 85 dollars that we went long at plus the 85 dollars that we went long at after< after we got exercise at 85 strike after we got exercise at 85 strike and< and then we minus off the credit. the and then we minus off the credit the total< total credit that we received and total credit that we received and divided< divided by two because it's 200 shares divided by two because it's 200 shares altogether< altogether divided by two and the altogether divided by two and the average< average is 93.

98 average is 93. 98 so< so as you can see we have significantly so as you can see we have. significantly reduced< reduced the average price from 110 reduced the average price from 110 to to to 93.

98 93. 98 93.

98 just< just by selling a put ratio just by selling a put ratio so< so this can definitely help increase the so this can definitely help increase the the< the probability of you break the probability of you break getting< getting break even a stock because it's getting break even a stock because it's much< much easier for the stock to go up to 93 much easier for the stock to go up to 93 98< 98 cents than it is to go to all the way 98 cents than it is to go to all the way to< to 110 dollars so this is the put ratio to 110 dollars so this is the put ratio spread spread spread all< all right repair method number three is all right repair method number three is deep< deep in the money call lips now if you deep in the money call lips now if you don't< don't really know what is leaves and don't really know what is leaves and what< what is deep in the money uh what is deep in the money uh i< i suggest that you go and watch the i suggest that you go and watch the other< other video which i've already created other video which i've already created it's< it's about lips where i'll tell you it's about lips where i'll tell you everything< everything you need to know about lips everything you need to know about lips there there there so so so the< the reason we want to use deep in money the reason we want to use deep in money called< called lips to repair is because you get called lips to repair is because you get to< to put up lesser capital than buying to put up lesser capital than buying shares< shares which means that there is lesser shares which means that there is lesser risk< risk so let's take a look at this stock risk so let's take a look at this stock. right< right here this is xbi which is the right here this is xbi which is the biotech< biotech etf so biotech etf so if< if you were to just go along right now if you were to just go along right now and< and buy a hundred shares you will have and buy a hundred shares you will have to< to put up you know eighty dollars sixty to put up you know eighty dollars sixty seven< seven cents times a hundred shares that seven cents times a hundred shares that is< is a total of eight thousand and sixty is a total of eight thousand and sixty seven< seven dollars you gotta put up this cash seven dollars you gotta put up this cash if< if you want to go long at this price now if you want to go long at this price now instead< instead of buying just four hundred instead of buying just four hundred shares< shares what you could do is to buy call shares what you could do is to buy call leaps< leaps right so call it as you can see leaps right so call it as you can see down< down here down here these< these are all the call options and these are all the call options and leaves< leaves basically just means where the leaves basically just means where the days< days to expiration is more than a year days to expiration is more than a year so< so as you can see this is 557 days so so as you can see this is 557 days so that's< that's well over a year that's well over a year so< so there are many different strikes that so there are many different strikes that you< you can choose from you can see down you can choose from you can see down here< here you can go from you know paying here you can go from you know paying very< very little very little just< just 12. 70 just 12.

70 right< right which is basically right which is basically 1270< 1270 dollars all. the way down to 1270 dollars all the way down to uh< uh 49. 50 right which is 4950 uh 49.

50 right which is 4950 okay okay okay so< so for this 49 delta call lip which is so for this 49 delta call lip which is slightly< slightly out of the money which is slightly out of the money which is considered< considered at the money considered at the money you'll< you'll be paying you'll be paying one< one thousand two hundred and twenty five one thousand two hundred and twenty five dollars< dollars now this is the billion ask dollars now this is the billion ask spread< spread if you notice that the spread if you notice that the billionaire< billionaire spread is quite big close to billionaire spread is quite big close to a< a dollar so that is why when you want to a dollar so that is why when you want to route< route an order every time when you run route an order every time when you run an< an order especially on leaves where it's an order especially on leaves where it's less< less liquid than the nearer to the less liquid than the nearer to the the< the the lower expiration dates like 45 the the lower expiration dates like 45 days< days or 30 days days or 30 days compared< compared to that this is generally compared to that this is. generally have< have a wider spread because it's not as have a wider spread because it's not as liquid liquid liquid so< so in this case you never just want to so in this case you never just want to take< take off the offer down here which is take off the offer down here which is the< the ask so the ask is basically where the ask so the ask is basically where the< the seller the seller the< the lowest price where a seller is the lowest price where a seller is willing< willing to let go of the shares now most willing to let go of the shares now most of< of the time is is the counterparty is of the time is is the counterparty is always< always a market maker so you can see the always a market maker so you can see the market< market maker has deliberately make the market maker has deliberately make the spread< spread very wide because they make the spread very wide because they make the difference< difference between this so if you want difference between this so if you want to< to buy it off right now to buy it off right now the< the most the readily available price is the most the readily available price is 12. 70< 12.

#### Topic 1

70 which is a thousand two hundred 12. 70 which is a thousand two hundred seventy< seventy dollars you do not want to buy seventy dollars you do not want to buy off< off this price instead you wanna take a off this price instead you wanna take a look< look at this price which is the mark look at this price which is the mark price< price so you always wanna have a column price so you always wanna have a column which< which says mark which is which says mark which is basically< basically just the mid price so you basically just the mid price so you wanna< wanna start off getting the the option wanna start off getting the the option at< at this price so for this 49 deltas at this price so for this 49 deltas you'll< you'll be paying a thousand two hundred you'll be paying a thousand two hundred twenty< twenty five dollars and that is a twenty five dollars and that is a fraction< fraction compared to what you will pay fraction compared to what you will pay if< if you pay a hundred shares right a if you pay a hundred shares right a hundred< hundred shares is eight thousand sixty hundred shares is eight thousand sixty seven< seven dollars now you could go to the seven dollars now you could go to the seven< seven one delta call leap so in this seven one delta call leap so in this case< case you'll be paying 2 case you'll be paying 2 330< 330 dollars 330 dollars and< and you could also go to the 89 delta and you could also go to the 89 delta call< call lib which is 4 000 call lib which is 4 000 and< and 10 slightly more expensive but the and 10 slightly more expensive but the the< the one that i would suggest that you go the one that i would suggest that you go with< with is this one which is the 89 with is this one which is the 89 basically< basically you want deltas that are very basically you want deltas that are very high< high 80 and above and the reason for high 80 and above and the reason for that that that is< is this column right here now this is this column right here now this column< column is the extrinsic value when it column is the extrinsic value when it comes< comes to options you must always take comes to options you must always take note< note of the extrinsic value because note of the extrinsic value because extrinsic< extrinsic value is basically just time extrinsic value is basically just time value value value if< if you are buying options you always if you are buying options you always want< want to buy as little extrinsic value as want to buy as little extrinsic value as possible< possible and if you're selling options possible and if you're selling options then< then you want to get the most extrinsic then you want to get the most extrinsic value< value as much as possible because this value as. much as possible because this extrinsic< extrinsic value will go to zero once it extrinsic value will go to zero once it expires< expires so once it becomes zero expires so once it becomes zero when< when it expires all extrinsic value will when it expires all extrinsic value will go< go to zero so this is the premium you go to zero so this is the premium you have< have to pay for getting this kind of have to pay for getting this kind of leverage< leverage so when you're buying the leverage so when you're buying the option< option especially when you're buying option especially when you're buying call< call leaps call leaps you< you want to pay as little extrinsic you want to pay as little extrinsic value< value as possible value as possible and< and the reason is because and the reason is because each< each day if the stock does nothing each day if the stock does nothing you'll< you'll be losing this be this is what you'll be losing this be this is what you< you call time decay you'll be losing you call time decay you'll be losing money< money every single day right so you money every single day right so you definitely< definitely want to lose much lesser definitely want to lose much lesser compared< compared to down here compared to down here and< and we want to buy this if you were to and we want to buy this if you were to compare< compare this to this you will see the compare this to this you will see the difference< difference in terms of what you'll be difference in terms of what you'll be losing< losing on average per day so if i were losing on average per day so if i were to< to take out my trusty calculator to take out my trusty calculator all< all right let's just calculate this very all right let's just calculate this very quickly< quickly let's say for example you quickly let's say for example you decided< decided to buy you know the 80 delta decided to buy you know the 80 delta sorry< sorry the l80 strike with the 62 dollars sorry the l80 strike with the 62 dollars that< that is roughly a thousand seven hundred that is roughly a thousand seven hundred and< and twenty eight dollars right seven one and twenty eight dollars right seven one thousand< thousand seven hundred and twenty eight thousand seven hundred and twenty eight dollars< dollars is what you'll be paying in dollars is what you'll be paying in terms< terms of extrinsic value and you divide terms of extrinsic value and you divide this< this by 557 days this by 557 days on< on average you'll be losing three on average you'll be losing three dollars< dollars and 10 cents every single day dollars and 10 cents every single day right< right but if you were to buy let's say right but if you were to buy let's say the< the 89 delta this one the 89 delta this one it's< it's 4.

43 it's 4. 43 so< so that is 443 and you divide it by so that is 443 and you divide it by. 557< 557 days so on average you'll be losing 557 days so on average you'll be losing only< only 79.

5 cents per day which is much only 79. 5 cents per day which is much lesser< lesser than three dollars 10 cents here lesser than three dollars 10 cents here so< so if you were to buy the at the money so if you were to buy the at the money call< call it call it all< all right although you are paying lesser all right although you are paying lesser the< the stock has to really move the stock has to really move quickly< quickly because otherwise you'll be quickly because otherwise you'll be losing< losing quite a bit every day right but losing quite a bit every day right but if< if you bought the dip in the money call if you bought the dip in the money call it it it time< time decay or the value of the option time decay or the value of the option that< that is decaying is lesser every single that is decaying is lesser every single day< day compared to at the money because day compared to at the money because most< most of it is the intrinsic value right most of it is the intrinsic value right you're< you're paying for mostly the. intrinsic you're paying for mostly the intrinsic value< value so this intrinsic value basically value so this intrinsic value basically is< is just the difference between the stock is just the difference between the stock price< price the current market price and your price the current market price and your strike< strike price so let me take out the strike price so let me take out the calculator< calculator again so you can take a look calculator again so you can take a look at< at this and again this is very important at this and again this is very important to< to understand when you're buying options to understand when you're buying options you< you want to buy as much intrinsic value you want to buy as much intrinsic value and< and as little extrinsic value and when and as little extrinsic value and when you're< you're selling options you want to sell you're selling options you want to sell as< as much extrinsic value as possible as much extrinsic value as possible so< so if you were to buy the stock right so if you were to buy the stock right now< now it's 80.

67 all right 80. 67 this is now it's 80.

67 all right 80. 67 this is the< the ask the ask. a< a minus of the strike is 35.

a minus of the strike is 35. so< so you can see it's 45.

67 dollars so you can see it's 45. 67 dollars in in in uh< uh intrinsic value so you can. see uh intrinsic value so you can see exactly< exactly it's 45.

67 exactly it's 45. 67 now< now this intrinsic value does not go to now this intrinsic value does not go to zero zero zero at< at expiration date because intrinsic at expiration date because intrinsic value< value is basically just the difference value is basically just the difference between< between this price and your strike price between this price and your strike price the< the only time this will go to zero is if the only time this will go to zero is if the< the stock goes to zero so basically it's the stock goes to zero so basically it's the< the same as holding stock the same as holding stock so< so that is why so that is why when< when you hold entrance more intrinsic when you hold entrance more intrinsic value< value you're not bothered that much by value you're not bothered that much by the< the time because this all you do is just the time because this all you do is just minus< minus this and the strike but extrinsic minus this and the strike but extrinsic value< value will always decay okay so that is value will always decay okay so that is why< why we go for the deep in the money core why we go for the deep in the money core leaps< leaps when we want to do a stock repair leaps when we want to do a stock repair strategy< strategy so let's take a look at an strategy so let's take a look at an example< example so you can see exactly how it's example so you can see exactly how it's done< done so again we use. the same example done so again we use the same example you're< you're long 100 shares 110 over here you're long 100 shares 110 over here now< now let's say the first step you want to now let's say the first step you want to identify< identify the level you want to buy it identify the level you want to buy it okay< okay so again 85 dollars we think 85 is okay so again 85 dollars we think 85 is a< a good place to buy so a good place to buy so what< what we want to do is we look for the what we want to do is we look for the longest< longest dated option the longest dte longest dated option the longest dte days< days to expiration and then determine days to expiration and then determine how< how much you want to pay for the lip so how much you want to pay for the lip so let's< let's say for example if you decide you let's say for example if you decide you want< want to pay 4 000 for the lip all right want to pay 4 000 for the lip all right so< so that's forty dollars so what you do so that's forty dollars so what you do is< is you would find the 45 strike price is you would find the 45 strike price and< and then you pay and then you kill the and then you pay and then you kill the order< order for 40 so this way your break even order for 40 so this way your break even will< will be at 85.

now if you want to pay will be at 85. now if you want to pay only< only three thousand five hundred dollars only three thousand five hundred dollars you< you just put in order thirty five you just put in order thirty five dollars< dollars this time you have the strike of dollars this time you have the strike of fifty< fifty and three thousand dollars again fifty and three thousand dollars again thirty< thirty dollars killing the order and a thirty dollars killing. the order and a strike< strike of fifty five you notice that if strike of fifty five you notice that if you< you add these two together it's always you add these two together it's always eighty< eighty five so this ensures that the eighty five so this ensures that the price price price rather< rather the break-even price that we are rather the break-even price that we are buying< buying at is always at 85.

#### Topic 2

now of course buying at is always at 85. now of course there< there is the extrinsic value portion so there is the extrinsic value portion so that< that means the market may have to drop that means the market may have to drop much< much further below 85 before you can get much further below 85 before you can get fuel fuel fuel so< so this is step two so this is step two all< all right step three all you have to do all right step three all you have to do is< is just simply place the limit order as is just simply place the limit order as you< you can see down here so if you have you can see down here so if you have decided< decided that is 3500 decided that is 3500 and< and in this case i went to take a look and in this case i went to take a look at< at disney and disney lower strike price at disney and disney lower strike price is< is 50 for the furthest dated option so is 50 for the furthest dated option so in< in this case i only can go as low as 50 in this case i only can go as low as 50 which< which is which is roughly< roughly 90 deltas roughly 90 deltas and< and i kill an order of 35 which is 3 500 and i kill an order of 35 which is 3 500 right< right so 3 500 is the risk so even right so 3 500 is the risk so even though< though it goes to zero though it goes to zero then< then the most i can lose is only three then the most i can lose is only three thousand< thousand five hundred dollars plus of thousand five hundred dollars plus of course< course this hundred and ten dollars course this hundred and ten dollars so< so that's all you have to do so it's so that's all you have to do so it's much< much more simpler by placing a deep in much more simpler by placing a deep in the< the money called lips for repair the money called lips for repair all< all right so let's put this all together all right so let's put this all together come< come to a conclusion so repairing your come to a conclusion so repairing your losing< losing stock means to lower the average losing stock means to lower the average price< price of your stock okay so what this price of your stock okay so what this does< does is that it increases the does is that it increases the probability< probability of break even because as the probability of break even because as the average< average price is lower it takes a average price is lower it takes a smaller< smaller move for your stock to get to smaller move for your stock to get to your< your break even price and you also get a your break even price and you also get a higher< higher profitability above your average higher profitability above your average price< price because now you're getting more price because now you're getting more shares< shares right you're getting more shares right you're getting more exposure< exposure to the stock but make no exposure to the stock but make no mistake< mistake this also increases your risk mistake this also increases your risk because< because you're actually putting up more because you're actually putting up more capital< capital right so if you hear other capital right so if you hear other people< people that says you know repair your people that says you know repair your stock< stock is a guaranteed way to make money stock is a guaranteed way to make money don't< don't listen to that take that with don't listen to that take that with grain< grain of salt because you need to grain of salt because you need to understand< understand that at the end of the day understand that at the end of the day the< the success of this strategy is the success of this strategy is dependent dependent dependent on< on whether the stock actually goes up or on whether the stock actually goes up or not< not so if you chose a stock that will go not so if you chose a stock that will go to< to zero to zero then< then no matter how you repair chances then no matter how you repair chances are< are you're probably not going to make are you're probably not going to make back< back the money that you lost. right so back the money that you lost right so this< this is one thing that you have to this is one thing that you have to understand< understand and that is why we only want understand and that is why we only want to< to repair stocks that you are confident to repair stocks that you are confident in< in holding for the long term that you in holding for the long term that you want< want to invest in and usually this is want to invest in and usually this is where< where the stock is fundamentally strong where the stock is fundamentally strong there's< there's a good there's a good uh< uh profit record is always growing its uh profit record is always growing its revenue< revenue growing its its profits and your revenue growing its its profits and your view< view on the stock hasn't changed now if view on the stock hasn't changed now if your< your view on the stock has changed then your view on the stock has changed then it's< it's better to just take your loss and it's better to just take your loss and move< move on to another stock you don't want move on to another stock you don't want to< to repair and add on to a stock that's to repair and add on to a stock that's eventually< eventually going to lose you more money eventually going to lose you more money that< that does not make sense so this is that does not make sense so this is important< important when you come when it comes to important when you come when it comes to repairing< repairing your stock repairing your stock and< and finally there are three methods to and finally there are three methods to repair< repair your losing stock positions you repair your losing stock positions you have< have the cash output where you just have the cash output where you just receive< receive your premium receive a credit up receive your premium receive a credit up front front front and< and wait until the price goes below your and wait until the price goes below your cash< cash to output strike price and cash to output strike price and expiration< expiration for you to get fuel expiration for you to get fuel repair< repair method 2 is the put ratio spread repair method 2 is the put ratio spread which< which you have just learned where you which you have just learned where you have< have a embedded bad put spread where you have a embedded bad put spread where you will< will make more as the market goes down will make more as the market goes down and< and then repair method three is the deep and then repair method three is the deep in< in the money call lips where you want to in the money call lips where you want to go< go for delta that is roughly around 80 go for delta that is roughly around 80 or< or more and pay as little extrinsic or more and pay as little extrinsic value< value as you can this way you will not value as you can this way you will not be be be losing< losing that much each day losing that much each day you< you give yourself a chance for the you give yourself a chance for the market< market to rebound back up and overall market to rebound back up and overall make< make a profit all right guys i hope you make a profit all right guys i hope you liked< liked this video if you do please give liked this video if you do please give me< me a thumbs up i hope this has been so me a thumbs up i hope this has been so

========================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we< we are going to be talking about a we are going to be talking about a pretty< pretty hotly debated topic well at least pretty hotly debated topic well at least on< on some of my videos and that is on stop on some of my videos and that is on stop losses< losses on options well do they actually losses on options well do they actually help< help or do they actually harm your help or do they actually harm your trading< trading performance so this is one of trading performance so this is one of the< the topics that I see newer Traders like the topics that I see newer Traders like to< to debate on right because mainly to debate on right because mainly because< because they've just transitioned from because they've just transitioned from the< the outright trading world you know the outright trading world you know where< where they are trading outright stocks where they are trading outright stocks and< and then they place a stop loss so when and then they place a stop loss so when they< they come to trading options they also they come to trading options they also try< try and transfer this concept of stop try and transfer this concept of stop losses< losses onto options so do they actually losses onto options so do they actually work< work or not so let's Dive Right into work or not so let's Dive Right into this< this so today I'm going to share with this so today I'm going to share with you< you quite a number of data research and you quite a number of data research and studies< studies so you know it will be pretty studies so you know it will be pretty deep< deep and hopefully we can put an end to deep and hopefully we can put an end to this< this debate once and for all so if you this debate once and for all so if you come< come from the traditional world of come from the traditional world of outright< outright stock trading Buy sell shares outright stock trading Buy sell shares then< then you would be very used to having a then you would be very used to having a stop< stop loss because having a stop loss is stop loss because having a stop loss is in< in important to manage your risk and not in important to manage your risk and not have< have any single trade blow up your have any single trade blow up your account account account but< but what about when it comes to trading but what about when it comes to trading options< options does it make sense to have a options does it make sense to have a stop< stop loss and a stop loss actually stop loss and a stop loss actually worked< worked the same way as it would right in worked the same way as it would right in options< options as in outright trading right so options as in outright trading right so for< for this we want to lean on data for this we want to lean on data research< research and all the studies that I've research and all the studies that I've already< already done to make a more informed already done to make a more informed decision< decision right the last thing we want is decision right the last thing we want is to< to pull out the idea you know out of the to pull out the idea you know out of the thin< thin air or let's just pull it out of thin air or let's just pull it out of our< our ass you know and think that we are our ass you know and think that we are right< right like anything in life when we are right like anything in life when we are making< making any decisions whether you realize making any decisions whether you realize it< it or not sometimes you are really it or not sometimes you are really already< already relying on statistics right on already relying on statistics right on data< data right let's say for example data right let's say for example whenever< whenever you buy any food sometimes you whenever you buy any food sometimes you will< will turn around to the packaging and will turn around to the packaging and you< you want to see you know what are the you want to see you know what are the ingredients< ingredients or whether you know there ingredients or whether you know there are< are any harmful stuff inside there right are any harmful stuff inside there right like< like for example transfer right trans like for example transfer right trans fat< fat many many many years ago we have no fat many many many years ago we have no idea< idea what that is but as more studies idea what that is but as more studies come< come out we found out that trans fat come out we found out that trans fat actually< actually you know increases is health actually you know increases is health risk< risk in our body right like for example risk in our body right like for example it< it increases the risk of having a heart it increases the risk of having a heart attack< attack or stroke so that is why you know attack or stroke so that is why you know when< when it comes to buying food we want to when it comes to buying food we want to try< try and avoid eating you know any food try and avoid eating you know any food that< that has trans fat because the data the that has trans fat because the data the research< research the statistics have already research the statistics have already proven< proven that it's bad for our health proven that it's bad for our health right< right in the long term so when it comes right in the long term so when it comes to< to training options it's the same way as to training options it's the same way as well< well we want to lean on the data well we want to lean on the data research< research to make an informed decision research to make an informed decision rather< rather than you know just believe that rather than you know just believe that our< our own thinking is right so this is our own thinking is right so this is where< where you want to unlearn everything where you want to unlearn everything that< that you have already learned from the that you have already learned from the traditional< traditional world of you know outright traditional world of you know outright trading< trading Buy sell stocks and then now trading Buy sell stocks and then now just< just open up your mind and take a look just open up your mind and take a look at< at some research which is specifically at some research which is specifically regarding< regarding options so this is the regarding options so this is the long-term< long-term performance of this strangle long-term performance of this strangle so< so this is a study Again by the tasty so this is a study Again by the tasty trade< trade team and they have done many many trade team and they have done many many research< research and studies on this and what research and studies on this and what they< they did is they compared managing they did is they compared managing losers< losers to holding to expiration and what losers to holding to expiration and what they< they found is that holding to expiration they found is that holding to expiration actually< actually gives a better result a better actually gives a better result a better return< return than managing losers right so as return than managing losers right so as you< you can see down here the managing loses you can see down here the managing loses is< is 2x what it just means is two times is 2x what it just means is two times the< the credit which you receive right so the credit which you receive right so for< for example if you sold the strangle for for example if you sold the strangle for a< a dollar and then you buy it back for a dollar and then you buy it back for three< three dollars what happens now is your three dollars what happens now is your losses losses losses okay< okay this is a three so your losses will okay this is a three so your losses will be< be two dollars okay so this is a dollar be two dollars okay so this is a dollar sign< sign pardon my drawing so what it means sign pardon my drawing so what it means is< is that per contract the max profit that is that per contract the max profit that you< you can make on this would be a hundred you can make on this would be a hundred dollars< dollars because that's the credit you dollars because that's the credit you receive< receive and because of your stop loss at receive and because of your stop loss at 2x< 2x your losses will be two hundred 2x your losses will be two hundred dollars< dollars okay so this is how they measure dollars okay so this is how they measure this< this studies down here this is how they this studies down here this is how they do< do their studies now this is for the do their studies now this is for the strangle< strangle you might be asking David what strangle you might be asking David what about< about the other strategies right so about the other strategies right so again< again this is for the shot put right again this is for the shot put right this< this is for the 16 Delta shot put and this is for the 16 Delta shot put and again< again as you can see down here holding again as you can see down here holding to< to expiration is much more effective to expiration is much more effective right< right the results are better than if you right the results are better than if you were< were to have a stop loss so again this were to have a stop loss so again this stop< stop loss I believe is at 2x as well now stop loss I believe is at 2x as well now while< while at the earlier stages right let's while at the earlier stages right let's say< say right after the crash somewhere say right after the crash somewhere around< around 2009 going into 2010 right around 2009 going into 2010 right managing< managing losers might have a better managing losers might have a better result< result right but this is pretty short result right but this is pretty short lift< lift right right because in a number of lift right right because in a number of years< years time you can see overall holding years time you can see overall holding to< to expiration is just going to to expiration is just going to outperform< outperform you know having stop losses outperform you know having stop losses so< so yes stop losses you're still going to so yes stop losses you're still going to be< be profitable but hey if you really just be profitable but hey if you really just held< held to expiration you would be even held to expiration you would be even more< more profitable so in this case there's more profitable so in this case there's no< no point for you to actually have a stop no point for you to actually have a stop loss< loss now you might be thinking to loss now you might be thinking to yourself< yourself hey Davis this is I'll Define yourself hey Davis this is I'll Define risk< risk right undefined risk what about risk right undefined risk what about Define< Define Rich strategies like credit Define Rich strategies like credit spreads< spreads and iron condors and I'm glad spreads and iron condors and I'm glad you< you asked because here are the studies you asked because here are the studies right< right so this is for credit spreads so I right so this is for credit spreads so I believe< believe this is the put spread so again believe this is the put spread so again they< they have tested you know the five they have tested you know the five dollars< dollars of white put spread and the ten dollars of white put spread and the ten dollars< dollars wide put spread and as you can dollars wide put spread and as you can see< see holding to expiration again has see holding to expiration again has better< better performance than you know if you better performance than you know if you were< were to cut your losers at 2x the were to cut your losers at 2x the premium< premium which you receive same thing for premium which you receive same thing for 10< 10 wide spread again holding to 10 wide spread again holding to expiration< expiration is much better than cutting expiration is much better than cutting losses< losses right having a stop loss now what losses right having a stop loss now what about< about in Condor and again iron Condor is about in Condor and again iron Condor is the< the same as well if you hold all the way the same as well if you hold all the way to< to expiration you can see your results to expiration you can see your results are< are still much better than you know are still much better than you know whatever< whatever multiple losses that you plan whatever multiple losses that you plan to< to cut off at you can see they have 1X to cut. off at you can see they have 1X all< all the way to 5x that means if you sell all the way to 5x that means if you sell at< at a dollar for this one exclusive at a dollar for this one exclusive you're< you're cutting off at two dollars and you're cutting off at two dollars and five< five losers basically you're cutting off five losers basically you're cutting off at< at six dollars and in all instances at six dollars and in all instances holding< holding to expiration is still much holding to expiration is still much better< better than if you were to have stop better than if you were to have stop losses< losses right so as you can see this is a losses right so as you can see this is a very< very common theme amongst all the very common theme amongst all the different< different strategies so we can really different strategies so we can really just< just see from here the data has already just see from here the data has already shown< shown the statistics have really proven shown the statistics have really proven to< to us that over the long term holding to to us that over the long term holding to expiration< expiration will already have a better expiration will already have a better result< result than if you were to actively result than if you were to actively manage< manage it and then have stop losses so manage it and then have stop losses so if< if stop losses are not as effective in if stop losses are not as effective in managing< managing risk and we don't want to hold managing risk and we don't want to hold to< to expiration mainly because you know we to expiration mainly because you know we do< do not want to have the risk of early do not want to have the risk of early assignment< assignment and then possibly having to assignment and then possibly having to face< face a margin call what can we do to face a margin call what can we do to manage< manage risk more effectively and get manage risk more effectively and get better< better results so if you have already better results so if you have already seen< seen a number of my videos or you've seen a number of my videos or you've been< been a follower of my channel for quite been a follower of my channel for quite some< some time then you probably already know some time then you probably already know what< what I'm about to say right and the what I'm about to say right and the answer< answer in terms of managing risks in answer in terms of managing risks in trading< trading options exiting at 21 DTE is trading options exiting at 21 DTE is much< much more effective than having a stop much more effective than having a stop loss< loss and again I'm not just pulling this loss and again I'm not just pulling this out< out of the thin air I want to lean on out of the thin air I want to lean on research< research data statistics right there's a research data statistics right there's a reason< reason why I say exit at 21 DTE is much reason why I say exit at 21 DTE is much better< better because there is evidence to better because there is evidence to support< support this so again as you can see support this so again as you can see down< down here this is the statistics the down here this is the statistics the data< data research study whatever you want to data research study whatever you want to call< call it has been already done and this call it has been already done and this is< is on the strangle as you can see we is on the strangle as you can see we already< already know that holding to expiration already know that holding to expiration is< is going to be far more effective than is going to be far more effective than having< having a stop loss right the results are having a stop loss right the results are completely< completely better but if you were to completely better but if you were to exit< exit at 21d te guess what your results exit at 21d te guess what your results are< are going to be even better than holding are going to be even better than holding to< to expiration which means to say it's to expiration which means to say it's going< going to be even far better than if you going to be even far better than if you have< have a stop loss all right now this is have a stop loss all right now this is for< for the strangle what about for the for the strangle what about for the other< other strategies well this is for the other strategies well this is for the naked< naked put right the short put the 16 naked put right the short put the 16 Delta< Delta put so as you can see exceeding at Delta put so as you can see exceeding at 21< 21 DTE again better than holding to 21 DTE again better than holding to expiration< expiration for credit spreads same thing expiration for credit spreads same thing as< as well right 21 DTE is still better as well right 21 DTE is still better than< than if you were to hold to expiration than if you were to hold to expiration and< and again that means far better than and again that means far better than having< having a stop loss and again for iron having a stop loss and again for iron Condors< Condors iron Condor same thing as well Condors iron Condor same thing as well if< if you were to Exit 21 DTE you're going if you were to Exit 21 DTE you're going to< to have a much better result than to have a much better result than holding< holding to expiration so there is holding to expiration so there is another< another table I want to show you which another table I want to show you which is< is far more interesting as to why this is far more interesting as to why this is< is so right because it's very positive is so right because it's very positive why< why is it that holding to 21 DTE and why is it that holding to 21 DTE and even< even holding to expiration is even even holding to expiration is even better< better than if you will have a stop loss better than if you will have a stop loss right< right because this is something a lot of right because this is something a lot of new< new Traders just cannot grasp why is new Traders just cannot grasp why is this< this so this so so< so if you were to take a look at this so if you were to take a look at this table< table down here it actually shows some table down here it actually shows some very< very very interesting data right some very very interesting data right some interesting< interesting research that they have interesting research that they have shown< shown so down here you can see these are shown so down here you can see these are the< the number of losers where you cut off the number of losers where you cut off right< right basically where you employ your right basically where you employ your stop< stop loss and this tells you you know stop loss and this tells you you know how< how many losers you would have incurred how many losers you would have incurred based< based on cutting off at you know the based on cutting off at you know the various< various multiples right based on your various multiples right based on your stop< stop loss and this is the number of stop loss and this is the number of losers< losers you would incur if you actually losers you would incur if you actually exit< exit at 21 DTE or earlier than 21 DTE so exit at 21 DTE or earlier than 21 DTE so you< you can see that if you were to cut off you can see that if you were to cut off at< at 1X the credit which you receive at 1X the credit which you receive you're< you're gonna have 28 losers but if you you're gonna have 28 losers but if you were< were to exit at 21 DTE right maybe even were to exit at 21 DTE right maybe even earlier< earlier you only have 12 losers and if earlier you only have 12 losers and if you< you go to you know 2x your losers then you go to you know 2x your losers then you< you would have 14 number of losers but you would have 14 number of losers but when< when it comes to 21 DTE or earlier you when it comes to 21 DTE or earlier you actually< actually have four losers and as you can actually have four losers and as you can see< see it goes all the way to the extreme see it goes all the way to the extreme if< if it goes to 5x you notice that you if it goes to 5x you notice that you actually< actually have two losers but when it actually have two losers but when it comes< comes to exceeding at 21 DTE 4X and 5x comes to exceeding at 21 DTE 4X and 5x losers< losers actually there isn't any at all losers actually there isn't any at all which< which means to say if you were to exit which means to say if you were to exit at< at 21 DTE you actually do not sustain at 21 DTE you actually do not sustain that< that big of a loss compared to if you that big of a loss compared to if you would< would have stop losses so this table would have stop losses so this table down< down here is even more interesting down here is even more interesting because< because they went into even more details because they went into even more details right< right they went in depth to find out how right they went in depth to find out how many< many of those losers actually became a many of those losers actually became a winner< winner right by closing at 21 DTE or winner right by closing at 21 DTE or earlier< earlier so if you were to exit at you earlier so if you were to exit at you know< know 1X the credit which you receive you know 1X the credit which you receive you can< can see that you have 12 losers but if can see that you have 12 losers but if you< you were to exit at 21 DTE 11 of those you were to exit at 21 DTE 11 of those losers< losers that you close out actually came losers that you close out actually came back< back and become a winner right they back and become a winner right they actually< actually became a profit and if you were actually became a profit and if you were to< to cut over 2X and 3X you can see that to cut over 2X and 3X you can see that at< at 2X and 3X you will have losers right at 2X and 3X you will have losers right four< four losers for 2x one loser for 3x but four losers for 2x one loser for 3x but then< then if you were to exit at 21 DTE or then if you were to exit at 21 DTE or earlier< earlier then guess what all those trades earlier then guess what all those trades actually< actually eventually came back and became actually eventually came back and became became< became a winner right so this again is became a winner right so this again is very< very very puzzling for a lot of new very very puzzling for a lot of new Traders< Traders and I'm gonna explain why this Traders and I'm gonna explain why this is< is so why some of these trades actually is so why some of these trades actually came< came back became a winner and it's not came back became a winner and it's not necessarily< necessarily because the market actually necessarily because the market actually bounced< bounced back although that could be one bounced back although that could be one of< of the reasons but another of the reason of the reasons but another of the reason is< is something that options have an is something that options have an outright< outright trading don't right and I'm outright trading don't right and I'm going< going to share this with you so why is going to share this with you so why is having< having a stop loss on options having a stop loss on options ineffective< ineffective by the way if you like this ineffective by the way if you like this video< video so far Please Subscribe and also video so far Please Subscribe and also click< click the thumbs up button and also do click the thumbs up button and also do get< get your free copy of the options income get your free copy of the options income blueprint< blueprint where I share the top three blueprint where I share the top three options< options strategies that help you options strategies that help you generate< generate a consistent income each month generate a consistent income each month trading< trading just one to two hours a day trading just one to two hours a day right< right so if you want to go ahead to get right so if you want to go ahead to get this< this copy just head on over to this copy just head on over to optionswithdavis. com< optionswithdavis.

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video well the main reason back to the video well the main reason is< is because options have a mechanism that is because options have a mechanism that outright< outright trading don't and that is Theta outright trading don't and that is Theta Decay< Decay Theta Decay just means that over Decay Theta Decay just means that over time< time the position right if it doesn't time the position right if it doesn't move< move it can can become more profitable move it can can become more profitable right< right because as you can see down here right because as you can see down here this< this is the purple line this purple line this is the purple line this purple line down< down here shows you your p l graph at down here shows you your p l graph at the< the point when you first put on the the point when you first put on the trade< trade right so this is a put spread and trade right so this is a put spread and the< the green line down here is where it's the green line down here is where it's at< at expiration now over time this purple at expiration now over time this purple line< line will start to move towards this line will start to move towards this green< green line and becomes this green line green line and becomes this green line at< at expiration which means to say let's at expiration which means to say let's say< say for example if the market actually say for example if the market actually trades< trades down down here and then you tell trades down down here and then you tell yourself< yourself hey you know it has already hit yourself hey you know it has already hit my< my stop loss of let's say 50 I'm going my stop loss of let's say 50 I'm going to< to get out of this position well you may to get out of this position well you may have< have gotten out a little prematurely have gotten out a little prematurely because< because if the market didn't move and because if the market didn't move and time< time just went by then guess what this time just went by then guess what this position< position is actually going to become position is actually going to become profitable< profitable now there's another way where profitable now there's another way where a< a lot of new Traders use stop losses and a lot of new Traders use stop losses and that< that is when it actually hits their that is when it actually hits their short< short strike down here right so this short strike down here right so this will< will be your short strike of the put will be your short strike of the put spread< spread minus one put this is where the spread minus one put this is where the long< long strike is plus one put right so long strike is plus one put right so this< this is where you have your ball put this is where you have your ball put spread< spread so many Traders new traders that spread so many Traders new traders that is< is they want to employ the stop loss at is they want to employ the stop loss at where< where the shot put is that means if the where the shot put is that means if the market< market was to trade down here this is market was to trade down here this is where< where they are going to cut their losses where they are going to cut their losses but< but this is actually not very effective but this is actually not very effective when< when it comes to options and this is the when it comes to options and this is the reason< reason why one thing down here you need reason why one thing down here you need to< to look at is the probability of touch to look at is the probability of touch so< so the probability of touch is a so the probability of touch is a statistic< statistic that will let us know you know statistic that will let us know you know what's< what's the percentage of it actually what's the percentage of it actually touching< touching that strike price at any time touching that strike price at any time before< before expiration right so for example before expiration right so for example if< if you have a 30 Delta shot put for your if you have a 30 Delta shot put for your put< put spread it just means you have put spread it just means you have roughly< roughly 70 win rate right so this is an roughly 70 win rate right so this is an expiration< expiration so you have a 70 win rate on expiration so you have a 70 win rate on your< your put spread which is actually pretty your put spread which is actually pretty good< good right this is what many Traders good right this is what many Traders want< want to strive for they want to have a want to strive for they want to have a pretty< pretty high win rate when it comes to pretty high win rate when it comes to having< having a put spread so 30 Deltas I would having a put spread so 30 Deltas I would say< say is pretty good A good mix of Premium say is pretty good A good mix of Premium as< as well as you know win rate now 30 as well as you know win rate now 30 Deltas< Deltas also mean another thing right it Deltas also mean another thing right it also< also means that it has a 30 chance of also means that it has a 30 chance of being< being in the money at expiration but being in the money at expiration but more< more importantly when it comes to stop more importantly when it comes to stop losses< losses you want to use probably a touch losses you want to use probably a touch which< which it means to say that it has a 60 which it means to say that it has a 60 chance< chance of being touched being breached chance of being touched being breached at< at any time before expiration right so at any time before expiration right so if< if you decide to exit your position if you decide to exit your position whenever< whenever your short strike gets breached whenever your short strike gets breached then< then guess what sixty percent of the then guess what sixty percent of the time< time you will be stopped out right so time you will be stopped out right so whenever< whenever the price drops down here whenever the price drops down here you're< you're gonna cut your loss most part of you're gonna cut your loss most part of it< it is likely going to be a loss because it is likely going to be a loss because sixty< sixty percent of time you're going to sixty percent of time you're going to cut< cut your losses so that is why having a cut your losses so that is why having a stop< stop loss on options is not going to be stop loss on options is not going to be that< that effective compared to if you were that effective compared to if you were to< to trade outright trading So based on to trade outright trading So based on all< all these statistics research and data all these statistics research and data that< that we've already seen we can conclude that we've already seen we can conclude that< that having stop losses is actually not that having stop losses is actually not as< as effective when it comes to options as effective when it comes to options trading< trading and it's much better to just trading and it's much better to just exit< exit at 21d ee now inevitably you know exit at 21d ee now inevitably you know whenever< whenever I show you know any of this whenever I show you know any of this data< data research and studies that have you data research and studies that have you know< know pretty strong conclusion that stop know pretty strong conclusion that stop losses< losses is not effective there will losses is not effective there will always< always still be some people that will always still be some people that will reach< reach out to me and then tell me you reach out to me and then tell me you know< know something like hey Davis what if know something like hey Davis what if I'm< I'm still not convinced that stop losses I'm still not convinced that stop losses are< are ineffective for training options and are ineffective for training options and I< I still think that stop losses will help I still think that stop losses will help reduce< reduce my risk when training options I reduce my risk when training options I still< still think that stop losses is going to still think that stop losses is going to get< get me better results because I've used get me better results because I've used it< it in outright trading and I think that it in outright trading and I think that it's< it's going. to work in options trading as it's going to work in options trading as well< well so I'm not convinced that you know well so I'm not convinced that you know the< the data they've just shown me the the data they've just shown me the studies< studies that you have just shown me is studies that you have just shown me is actually< actually true right maybe because you actually true right maybe because you know< know you're using stop losses know you're using stop losses differently< differently right you might say that hey differently right you might say that hey I< I use stop losses differently right I I use stop losses differently right I don't< don't cut off at the multiple you know I don't cut off at the multiple you know I cut< cut off in terms of a dollar amount cut off in terms of a dollar amount right< right let's say maybe at fifty dollars I right let's say maybe at fifty dollars I want< want to cut off the position or at 100 I want to cut off the position or at 100 I want< want to cut it off or maybe you say that want to cut it off or maybe you say that your< your stock losses is based on technical your stock losses is based on technical analysis< analysis right I cut off my positions analysis right I cut off my positions you< you know when it breaches the stop loss you know when it breaches the stop loss or< or when it Bridges the resistance right or when it Bridges the resistance right if< if you're one of those guys in this camp if you're one of those guys in this camp where< where you're saying this then here's my where you're saying this then here's my answer< answer to you so if despite all the answer to you so if despite all the studies< studies and research that I've already studies and research that I've already shown< shown you that shows that stop losses shown you that shows that stop losses are< are no better than holding to expiration are no better than holding to expiration and< and in fact exiting at 21 DTE will yield and in fact

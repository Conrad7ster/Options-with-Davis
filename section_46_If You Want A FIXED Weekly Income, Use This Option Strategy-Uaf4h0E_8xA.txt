===========================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about weekly we're going to be talking about weekly income< income right so I had a number of people income right so I had a number of people that< that have reached out to me and ask you that have reached out to me and ask you know< know Davis I'm about to reach my know Davis I'm about to reach my retirement< retirement age soon what kind of uh retirement age soon what kind of uh option< option strategies can I use to get option strategies can I use to get predictable< predictable weekly income so the word predictable weekly income so the word predictable< predictable has been used uh quite a few predictable has been used uh quite a few times< times by number of people that reached times by number of people that reached out< out to me so what I assume is that if out to me so what I assume is that if you< you want this predictable weekly income you want this predictable weekly income is< is that you the amount each week is that you the amount each week regardless< regardless what the market does right so regardless what the market does right so one< one thing to understand is this so for one thing to understand is this so for most< most people getting into option most people getting into option strategies< strategies uh when they start to trade strategies uh when they start to trade spreads< spreads they would start to trade spreads they would start to trade something< something like the credit spread or something like the credit spread or maybe< maybe the iron Condor but this maybe the iron Condor but this strategies< strategies I would say is not exactly strategies I would say is not exactly predictable< predictable in the sense right because predictable in the sense right because although< although it's a high win rate strategy although it's a high win rate strategy let's< let's say for example you choose a 70% let's say for example you choose a 70% or< or 80% win rate credit spread it also or 80% win rate credit spread it also means< means that 20 to 30% of the time you means that 20 to 30% of the time you actually< actually lose money right probability actually lose money right probability already< already depicts the losses will come and already depicts the losses will come and when< when losses come it's not exactly when losses come it's not exactly predictable< predictable right because you don't predictable right because you don't necessarily< necessarily get to keep the premium necessarily get to keep the premium which< which you had sold it for at the start which you had sold it for at the start so< so what kind of strategies can you so what kind of strategies can you actually< actually get predictable weekly income actually get predictable weekly income whereby< whereby regardless wherever the market whereby regardless wherever the market goes< goes you still get to keep that premium goes you still get to keep that premium well< well in that case then there are two well in that case then there are two strategies< strategies that you will be looking at strategies that you will be looking at so< so the first strategy would be the cash so the first strategy would be the cash secure< secure put so the cash secure put secure put so the cash secure put basically< basically is a short putut where you basically is a short putut where you have< have already told yourself that you're have already told yourself that you're okay< okay with being assigned on the okay with being assigned on the underlying< underlying right 100 shares of the underlying right 100 shares of the underling< underling so this way even though you underling so this way even though you get< get a sign you still actually get to get a sign you still actually get to keep< keep the premium because you actually keep the premium because you actually don't< don't mind getting uh the shares right don't mind getting uh the shares right so< so that's the very first strategy now so that's the very first strategy now the< the second strategy is cover call so the second strategy is cover call so cover< cover call first of all you need to have cover call first of all you need to have at<. at least 8 100 shares of the underlying at least 8 100 shares of the underlying and< and then if you sell the cover call this and then if you sell the cover call this is< is is where you get predictable income is is where you get predictable income right< right because regardless where the right because regardless where the market< market goes you're still going to get market goes you're still going to get that< that income so even though if the market that income so even though if the market goes< goes down you're still going to get a goes down you're still going to get a cover< cover call income if the market goes cover call income if the market goes past< past your cover call you're going to get past your cover call you're going to get out< out of the shares but you're still going out of the shares but you're still going to< to get the income so these two to get the income so these two strategies< strategies are the main ones you want to strategies are the main ones you want to look< look at if you're looking at predictable look at if you're looking at predictable income< income where you get to keep the premium income where you get to keep the premium regardless< regardless what the market does so one regardless what the market does so one thing< thing to understand is that if you were thing to understand is that if you were to< to trade these two strategies two things to trade these two strategies two things you< you need to know number one you have to you need to know number one you have to be< be okay with getting a sign on the be okay with getting a sign on the shares< shares of the underlying and the other shares of the underlying and the other one< one you don't mind getting your shares one you don't mind getting your shares called< called away right for the covered call called away right for the covered call now< now next let's talk about the actual now next let's talk about the actual selection< selection of uh the DTE and the strike selection of uh the DTE and the strike price< price so straightforward if you want a price so straightforward if you want a weekly< weekly income then of course you want to weekly income then of course you want to choose< choose one that's something around one choose one that's something around one week< week right around 7 days so as you can week right around 7 days so as you can see< see this one is 5 days the next one is see this one is 5 days the next one is 12< 12 days so if you want something that is 12 days so if you want something that is is< is on the shorter term this is one of is on the shorter term this is one of these< these two you can select now let's just these two you can select now let's just say< say we go into the 5 DTE one so let's say we go into the 5 DTE one so let's open< open up this option chain for the 5 DTE open up this option chain for the 5 DTE and< and I'll just remove the arrows here so and I'll just remove the arrows here so how< how do you decide which track price do how do you decide which track price do you< you choose so let's focus on the cash you choose so let's focus on the cash secure< secure put side first so as you can see secure put side first so as you can see on< on your option chain it should be on the on your option chain it should be on the right< right hand side for the puts now let's right hand side for the puts now let's take< take a look at what is the current price take a look at what is the current price of< of the underly so as you can see right of the underly so as you can see right now< now as of this recording Google is now as of this recording Google is around around around $167< $167 which means to say the at the money $167 which means to say the at the money option< option is somewhere around this strike option is somewhere around this strike price< price down here which is price down here which is 167. 5< 167.

5 right close enough so this is 167. 5 right close enough so this is slightly< slightly in the money whereby the strike slightly in the money whereby the strike price< price is above where the current price price is above where the current price is< is so anything that is at the money is is so anything that is at the money is around< around where the current market price is around where the current market price is anything< anything that's in the money is where anything that's in the money is where the< the strike prices are above the current the strike prices are above the current market< market for the put side anything that's market for the put side anything that's out< out of the money is somewhere below out of the money is somewhere below where< where the current market price is so where the current market price is so this< this is out of the money this is in the this is out of the money this is in the money< money and this is at the money so what money and this is at the money so what you< you notice is that the premiums will you notice is that the premiums will always< always be the highest for in the money always be the highest for in the money right< right as. you can see down here but the right as you can see down here but the problem< problem with in the money is that you're problem with in the money is that you're actually< actually taking on some intrinsic value actually taking on some intrinsic value so< so most of the time when we are talking so most of the time when we are talking about< about cash to Output usually we are not about cash to Output usually we are not going< going to be looking at the in the money going to be looking at the in the money strike< strike price right because it's already strike price right because it's already inside< inside of the money usually we're inside of the money usually we're looking< looking at either either out the money looking at either either out the money or< or at the money so let's focus at the at or at the money so let's focus at the at the< the money first so you notice at the at the money first so you notice at the at the< the money you can actually get quite a the money you can actually get quite a pretty< pretty nice premium right you can see pretty nice premium right you can see it's< it's about it's about $290< $290 $2.

90 in premium which is about $290 $2. 90 in premium which is about $290< $290 per option so as you can see it's $290 per option so as you can see it's pretty< pretty decent right so if you were to pretty decent right so if you were to sell< sell this every week you can get $290 sell this every week you can get $290 just< just into your account so even if the just into your account so even if the market< market actually goes below this strike market actually goes below this strike price< price at expiration that means you going price at expiration that means you going to< to get a sign on the shares at to get a sign on the shares at $167< $167 or it goes above the K strike price. $167 or it goes above the K strike price you're< you're still going to keep this premium you're still going to keep this premium down< down here but this premium it means that down here but this premium it means that you< you also have a higher chance of getting you also have a higher chance of getting assigned< assigned shares right so how do you tell assigned shares right so how do you tell what's< what's the chances we just take a look what's the chances we just take a look at< at this probability of in the money at this probability of in the money right< right as you can see down here for the right as you can see down here for the strike< strike price of 67.

5 you have a 53% strike price of 67. 5 you have a 53% chance< chance of getting assigned the shares so chance of getting assigned the shares so it< it is about a coin flip chart for you to it is about a coin flip chart. for you to get< get assigned the shares so if you really get assigned the shares so if you really don't< don't mind actually getting into the don't mind actually getting into the shares< shares at around 167.

5 then you can shares at around 167. 5 then you can definitely< definitely sell it over here now what if. definitely sell it over here now what if you< you say that hey 167.

5 is not a price you say that hey 167. 5 is not a price that< that you really want to get into then that you really want to get into then you< you might want to consider the out the you might want to consider the out the money< money right so this is where you can see money right so this is where you can see that< that as the further the strike prices go that as the further the strike prices go out< out of the money the cheaper the out of the money the cheaper the premiums< premiums are right as you can see you premiums are right as you can see you get< get lesser and lesser so this is always get lesser and lesser so this is always a< a trade-off right do you want to get a trade-off right do you want to get more< more premiums with the higher chance. of more premiums with the higher chance of getting< getting a sign or do you want to get a getting a sign or do you want to get a lower< lower chance of getting a sign but then lower chance of getting a sign but then also< also at the same time getting lower also at the same time getting lower premium< premium so that is why when you enter premium so that is why when you enter the< the cash secure putut what I suggest it the cash secure putut what I suggest it has< has to already be at a price which you has to already be at a price which you are< are comfortable to be assigned the are comfortable to be assigned the shares< shares so let's say for example you are shares so let's say for example you are not< not comfortable at 167.

5 let's just say not comfortable at 167. 5 let's just say that< that you think it's a little bit too that you think it's a little bit too expensive< expensive for your taste but you expensive for your taste but you actually< actually don't mind getting ass sign at actually don't mind getting ass sign at 160< 160 so there are two things that you can 160 so there are two things that you can do< do number one you can just sell the 160 do number one you can just sell the 160 at< at this point right now. right and then at this point right now right and then you< you get $60 right it's not that much but you get $60 right it's not that much but hey< hey at least it's predictable you know hey at least it's predictable you know that< that you're definitely going to get this that you're definitely going to get this amount< amount into your account and the chances amount into your account and the chances of< of you actually getting a sign is only of you actually getting a sign is only 18.

82%< 18. 82% at expiration right so that means 18.

82% at expiration right so that means the< the next 5 days so if the next 5 days the next 5 days so if the next 5 days you< you have roughly about 20% chance that you have roughly about 20% chance that you're< you're going to be assigned 80% chance you're going to be assigned 80% chance that< that you're not going to be assigned and that you're not going to be assigned and that< that means you can keep selling again to that means you can keep selling again to get< get that premium Now what if you don't get that premium Now what if you don't mind< mind to get ass signed at mind to get ass signed at $160< $160 but you think that the premium of $160 but you think that the premium of $60< $60 right maybe the mid price is around $60 right maybe the mid price is around 75< 75 cents or so right around there if you 75 cents or so right around there if you think< think this premium is a little bit too think this premium is a little bit too little< little then what you can actually do is little then what you can actually do is to< to just wait for the market to actually to just wait for the market to actually come< come down so if the market does come come down so if the market does come down< down and it reaches to 160 at the down and it reaches to 160 at the current< current market price that mean instead current market price that mean instead of< of 167 maybe now the market has dropped of 167 maybe now the market has dropped to< to 160 this is where you see that the to 160 this is where you see that the 160< 160 now becomes at the money so once it 160 now becomes at the money so once it becomes< becomes at the money your premium will becomes at the money your premium will look< look like this most likely right around. look like this most likely right around there< there so this is where you can get into there so this is where you can get into the< the price which you don't mind getting the price which you don't mind getting assigned< assigned and you get a higher premium as assigned and you get a higher premium as well< well right so that's what you can do if well right so that's what you can do if you< you want a higher premium now of course you want a higher premium now of course one< one thing you need to realize is that one thing you need to realize is that the< the market may not necessarily trade the market may not necessarily trade down< down to 160 if the market suddenly just down to 160 if the market suddenly just continues< continues to go up then you won't be continues to go up then you won't be able< able to sell this now what about for the able to sell this now what about for the cover< cover call so the cover call is pretty cover call so the cover call is pretty much< much the same so now the cover call much the same so now the cover call you're< you're looking at the left side of the you're looking at the left side of the option< option chain so let me just scroll all option chain so let me just scroll all the< the way uh down here let's open up more the way uh down here let's open up more options< options so you can see more strike options so you can see more strike prices< prices so at this point of time you also prices so at this point of time you also have< have two choices right this is where you have two choices right this is where you don't< don't mind having your shares called don't mind having your shares called away< away so let's say for example you happen away so let's say for example you happen to< to get a sign at 167. 5 right so maybe to get a sign at 167.

#### Topic 1

5 right so maybe you< you sold at 167. 5 you got to from the you sold at 167.

5 you got to from the cash< cash put already now you want to sell cash put already now you want to sell the< the cover call so two things you can do the cover call so two things you can do number< number one you could either just number one you could either just immediately< immediately sell the. cover call at the immediately sell the cover call at the same< same strike price so when you're selling same strike price so when you're selling it< it what this means is that you have no it what this means is that you have no capital< capital gains right because you're capital gains right because you're assigned< assigned at 167. 5 if your Shar is going assigned at 167.

5 if your Shar is going to< to get CAU away at 167. 5 based on the to get CAU away at 167.

5 based on the shares< shares that you assign you're not going shares that you assign you're not going to< to make anything but you're going to to make anything but you're going to receive< receive the premium which you have receive the premium which you have already< already sold for this so two things will already sold for this so two things will happen< happen at this point time if the market happen at this point time if the market continues< continues to go all the way up so in continues to go all the way up so in this< this case that means it goes higher past this case that means it goes higher past your< your strike price then you're going to. your strike price then you're going to get< get CAU away you're going to receive the get CAU away you're going to receive the premium< premium so again predictable right premium so again predictable right because< because this is the amount that you sold because this is the amount that you sold it< it for and you don't mind getting your it for and you don't mind getting your shares< shares caught away now what if you shares caught away now what if you expect< expect that the market is going to keep expect that the market is going to keep going< going up and you do not want to get going up and you do not want to get caught< caught away at 167. 5 so in this case caught away at 167.

5 so in this case same< same thing you want to choose the out of same thing you want to choose the out of the< the money options so for example let's the money options so for example let's say< say that. you want to get out of the say that you want to get out of the shares< shares or rather you don't mind getting shares or rather you don't mind getting out< out the shares at around out the shares at around 172. 5< 172.

5 so in this case what you want to 172. 5 so in this case what you want to do< do instead is that you're not going to do instead is that you're not going to sell< sell this one instead you're going to sell this one instead you're going to sell< sell this one down here so you're going sell this one down here so you're going to< to receive $77. in premium which is to receive $77 in premium which is already< already in your account the moment you already in your account the moment you sell< sell it and at expiration two things sell it and at expiration two things going< going to happen if the market doesn't go going to happen if the market doesn't go above above above 172.

5< 172. 5 then you're still going to have 172.

5 then you're still going to have the< the shares and then you can keep selling the shares and then you can keep. selling the< the cover call again now if the market the cover call again now if the market goes< goes above goes above 172. 5< 172.

5 then guess what not only do you 172. 5 then guess what not only do you have< have the premium which you already have the premium which you already received< received in your account when you sold received in. your account when you sold this< this cover call on top of that you also this cover call on top of that you also have< have the capital gains from 167.

#### Topic 2

5 you have the capital gains from 167. 5 you sold< sold it at 172.

5 so you have a capital sold it at 172. 5 so you have a capital gains< gains of $5 per share which is total of gains of $5 per share which is total of $500< $500 per 100 shares that you have now $500 per 100 shares that. you have now what< what if you tell yourself same thing as what if you tell yourself same thing as well< well as the cash secure output let's say well as the cash secure output let's say that< that 172.

5 is what you're eyeing at but that 172. 5 is what you're eyeing at but you< you think that the premium is a little you think that the premium is a little bit< bit too late little so same thing what bit too late little so same. thing what you< you could do is that you could wait you could do is that you could wait until< until the stock actually goes all the until the stock actually goes all the way< way to way to 172.

5< 172. 5 then you sell it as an at the 172.

5 then you sell it as an at the money< money which you should get this kind of money which you should get this kind of premium< premium and then you get higher premium premium and then you get higher premium at< at the same time if your shares get CAU at the same time if your shares get CAU away< away you also get the capital gains now away you also get the capital gains now one< one other thing to understand regarding one other thing to understand regarding the< the cash secure put is that when you get the cash secure put is that when you get assigned< assigned the shares you need to have the assigned the shares you need to have the funds< funds to actually purchase the 100 funds to actually purchase the 100 shares< shares right each option controls 100 shares right each option controls 100 shares< shares so so if you get assigned on one shares so so if you get assigned on one cash< cash SEC putut then you need to have the cash SEC putut then you need to have the funds< funds to be assigned on the strike price funds to be assigned on the strike price which< which you selected so if you chose the which you selected so if you chose the strike< strike price of strike price of $160< $160 that just means that you need $160 that just means that you need $166,000< $166,000 to get a sign so if you think $166,000 to get a sign so if you think this< this is a little bit too pricey for you this is a little bit too pricey for you maybe< maybe you don't have that big of account maybe you don't have that big of account then< then what you want to do is go for a then what you want to do is go for a lower< lower price stock but naturally of lower price stock but naturally of course< course with lower price stocks you have course with lower price stocks you have lower< lower premium so let's just use an lower premium so let's just use an example< example let's just say we use palet here example let's just say we use palet here as< as an example now please take note this as an example now please take note this is< is not a recommendation for you to go is not a recommendation for you to go into< into palente tier you want to do your into palente tier you want to do your own< own due diligence all right so I'm just own due diligence all right so I'm just going< going to use palen as an example so if going to use palen as an example so if we< we were to compare the five days DTE we were to compare the five days DTE right< right days to expiration you will see right days to expiration you will see that< that the add the money which is $27 the that the add the money which is $27 the strike< strike price is only giving you about strike price is only giving you about $60< $60 but it's actually not so bad right $60 but it's actually not so bad right because< because pener although it is lower price because pener although it is lower price you< you notice that you can actually get a you notice that you can actually get a better< better premium for the amount that better premium for the amount that you're< you're going to put up when you get you're going to put up when you get assigned< assigned the shares right for example if assigned the shares right for example if you< you get assigned on 27 strike price you you get assigned on 27 strike price you have< have to put up have to put up $2,700< $2,700 all right. per option contract so $2,700 all right per option contract so you're< you're going to receive $60 at the same you're going to receive $60 at the same time< time but if we compare this to Google so time but if we compare this to Google so let< let me just very quickly bring up Google let me just very quickly bring up Google again< again over here so remember $60 in again over here so remember $60 in premium< premium $27 strike price now for the premium $27 strike price now for the same< same $60 you can see over here which is same $60 you can see over here which is this< this one your strike price is actually this one your strike price is actually $160< $160 which means to say you have to put $160 which means to say you have to put up up up $116,000< $116,000 to get the same premium of $60 $116,000 to get the same premium of $60 so< so if you're able to find such kind of a so if you're able to find such kind of a stocks< stocks that is pretty low price and at stocks that is pretty low price and at the< the same time you know the volatility is the same time you know the volatility is a< a bit high so as you can see down here a bit high so as you can see down here the< the volatility down here is much higher the volatility down here is much higher than< than Google that is why you're getting than Google that is why you're getting more< more premium then you'll be able to get more premium then you'll be able to get more< more bank for your bup but of course more bank for your bup but of course that< that is not to say you want to only go that is not to say you want to only go for< for the stocks that has very very high for the stocks that has very very high premiums premiums premiums because< because it might be a very lousy stock because it might be a very lousy stock right< right for example gamestock these are right for example gamestock these are meme< meme stocks they have very high premium meme stocks they have very high premium but< but you never know is it going to go up but you never know is it going to go up or< or is it going to go all the way down to or is it going to go all the way down to zero< zero so again stock selection is very zero so again stock selection is very important< important so guys so if you're talking important so guys so if you're talking about< about predictable weekly income then the about predictable weekly income then the strategies< strategies you want to go for will be strategies you want to go for will be the< the cash output and the cover call by the cash output and the cover call by the< the way if you like this video then

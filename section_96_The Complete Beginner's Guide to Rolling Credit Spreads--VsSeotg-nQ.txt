=======================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so today's video is all right alrighty so today's video is on< on the complete beginner's guide to on the complete beginner's guide to Rolling< Rolling credit spread so if you have a Rolling credit spread so if you have a credit< credit spread that is probably in credit spread that is probably in trouble< trouble it's not working out for you trouble it's not working out for you then< then you might consider to roll your then you might consider to roll your credit< credit spread so first of all what credit spread so first of all what exactly< exactly is rolling right so rolling is exactly is rolling right so rolling is simply< simply the simultaneous process of two simply the simultaneous process of two things< things right the first off is to close things right the first off is to close out< out your existing credit spread so this out your existing credit spread so this could< could be a bull put spread or it could could be a bull put spread or it could be< be a bear call spare and most of time be a bear call spare and most of time it's< it's in a loss right usually it's when it's in a loss right usually it's when it's< it's a loss that you would consider it's a loss that you would consider rolling< rolling it you know giving it more rolling it you know giving it more duration< duration so that the trade has a chance duration so that the trade has a chance to< to work out so the first one is usually to work out so the first one is usually when< when it's a loss there you know if you when it's a loss there you know if you want< want to roll is close out your existing want to roll is close out your existing trade< trade and then you open a new trade trade and then you open a new trade for< for an overall net credit all right this for an overall net credit all right this is< is very important because if you were to is very important because if you were to roll< roll for a net debit what it means is roll for a net debit what it means is that< that you're actually increasing your that you're actually increasing your overall< overall risk and reducing your overall overall risk and reducing your overall Max< Max profit all right so this is Max profit all right so this is important< important you want to have a net credit important you want to have a net credit because< because with a net credit you will be because with a net credit you will be increasing< increasing your max profit increasing your max profit all< all right Max profit and then if you all right Max profit and then if you were< were to increase the max profit you were to increase the max profit you would< would actually be reducing your max loss would actually be reducing your max loss all< all right so I'll get into this a little all right so I'll get into this a little bit< bit more later on but basically what you bit more later on but basically what you need< need to understand is that rolling need to understand is that rolling comprises< comprises of just two parts right comprises of just two parts right closing< closing your existing trade and then closing your existing trade and then open< open a new trade to sell another credit open a new trade to sell another credit spread< spread and you want to do all this in a spread and you want to do all this in a single< single order ticket right this is very single order ticket right this is very important< important because if you do not do this important because if you do not do this in< in a single order ticket you will have in a single order ticket you will have what< what is called legging risk all right so what is called legging risk all right so here's< here's an example here's an example so<. so let's say you have already put on a so let's say you have already put on a credit< credit spread so in this case this is a credit spread so in this case this is a bull< bull put spread so for this bull put bull put spread so for this bull put spread< spread you can see that it's trading at spread you can see that it's trading at one< one dollar and twelve cents so maybe one dollar and twelve cents so maybe when< when you first put it on it could be a when you first put it on it could be a dollar< dollar so maybe you sold it for a dollar dollar so maybe you sold it for a dollar and< and it's right now you know it moved and it's right now you know it moved against< against you it's now marking at dollars against you it's now marking at dollars and< and 12 cents so this is where you might and 12 cents so this is where you might want< want to consider rolling so let's say want to consider rolling so let's say you< you decide to roll this trade so if you you decide to roll this trade so if you were< were to roll it the first thing you were to roll it the first thing you would< would do is to close out the original would do is to close out the original trade< trade which means to buy back this bull trade which means to buy back this bull put< put spread so you buy it back for a put spread so you buy it back for a dollar< dollar 12 cents and then you want to dollar 12 cents and then you want to open< open a new trade with a longer days to open a new trade with a longer days to expiration< expiration so as you can see you close expiration so as you can see you close out< out the one which is in May and then you out the one which is in May and then you opened< opened the one that is later on is in 16 opened the one that is later on is in 16 June< June so this is later on and for this June so this is later on and for this example< example we just keep the same strikes example we just keep the same strikes right< right so as you can see down here the right so as you can see down here the credit< credit which you receive for selling credit which you receive for selling this< this longer duration this longer duration uh< uh crazy uh crazy is< is higher than the debit that you paid is higher than the debit that you paid to< to buy back to close the original trade to buy back to close the original trade and< and this gives you a net credit of 16 and this gives you a net credit of 16 cents< cents so which means to say now your new cents so which means to say now your new risk< risk profile is different right so risk profile is different right so previously< previously you made a dollar or rather previously you made a dollar or rather your< your max profit is a dollar and then your max profit is a dollar and then your< your Max Base would be four dollars but your Max Base would be four dollars but after< after rolling this trade because now you after rolling this trade because now you have< have a net credit so now your new risk have a net credit so now your new risk profile< profile is read by your max reward your profile is read by your max reward your max< max profit will be a dollar sixteen max profit will be a dollar sixteen cents< cents and then your max loss will be cents and then your max loss will be basically< basically this four dollars minus of basically this four dollars minus of this< this 16 cents and if my meds is not this 16 cents and if my meds is not wrong< wrong will be 3. 84 so as you can see now wrong will be 3.

84 so as you can see now you< you have skilled the risk and reward you have skilled the risk and reward even< even more to your favor by Rolling it so even more to your favor by Rolling it so what< what you want to do is by doing it in a what you want to do is by doing it in a single< single order ticket you don't want to single order ticket you don't want to spread< spread it out so this is done using the spread it out so this is done using the TD< TD Ameritrade they think of swim TD Ameritrade they think of swim platform< platform so you can see down here is platform so you can see down here is using< using the option called vertical row if using the option called vertical row if you're< you're using tastytrade I believe you you're using tastytrade I believe you can< can just use the right click function can just use the right click function click< click on your credit spare right click click on your credit spare right click it< it and then it will give you the option it and then it will give you the option to< to roll it all right so now that we know to roll it all right so now that we know exactly< exactly what is rolling so the question exactly what is rolling so the question now< now is when do you roll it right so when now is when do you roll it right so when is< is the best time or the optimum time to is the best time or the optimum time to roll< roll your credit spreads all right so roll your credit spreads all right so first< first off here is an example that you first off here is an example that you can< can see so let's say for example you are can see so let's say for example you are bearish< bearish on spy right so this is the bearish on spy right so this is the spiders< spiders the ETF the index ETF so you can spiders the ETF the index ETF so you can see< see that the market you know is pretty see that the market you know is pretty extended< extended it's gone up quite a bit and extended it's gone up quite a bit and the< the market has gone down so let's just the market has gone down so let's just say< say for example you are bearish on this say for example you are bearish on this so< so if you're bearish on this one way to so if you're bearish on this one way to trade< trade a bearish uh way is to enter into trade a bearish uh way is to enter into a< a bear call spread all right so in this a bear call spread all right so in this example< example you can see we sold the four one example you can see we sold the four one five< five four two zero uh back call spread five four two zero uh back call spread so< so when do you roll so first you can so when do you roll so first you can consider< consider rolling When there's less than consider rolling When there's less than 21< 21 days to expiration so this is the 21 days to expiration so this is the marker< marker that I always want to use and the marker that I always want to use and the reason< reason for this is because when we are reason for this is because when we are training< training any shot options any shot training any shot options any shot options< options strategies like the bear call options strategies like the bear call right< right whenever your strike gets in the right whenever your strike gets in the money< money there's always a chance for an money there's always a chance for an early< early assignment so in this case for early assignment so in this case for example< example you're this bad call spread if example you're this bad call spread if let's< let's say for example the market will let's say for example the market will still< still get in the money right for your still get in the money right for your back< back hole spread then there's always a back hole spread then there's always a chance< chance that you could be assigned early chance that you could be assigned early assignment< assignment on your this short call site assignment on your this short call site right< right so if the call buyer right so if the call buyer decides< decides to exercise their call option decides to exercise their call option what< what happens is that now you will be what happens is that now you will be shot< shot 100 shares at this price and it's shot 100 shares at this price and it's going< going to be a big problem because most going to be a big problem because most of< of the time when we enter into such of the time when we enter into such option< option trades we do not expect to be option trades we do not expect to be assigned< assigned because you know we just want assigned because you know we just want to< to trade the options we do not want to to trade the options we do not want to have< have the hassle of you know having the have the hassle of you know having the shares< shares and we want to clear out the shares and we want to clear out the share< share so if you're going to be assigned share so if you're going to be assigned on< on this you need to put up the margin on this you need to put up the margin requirement< requirement to short these shares and if requirement to short these shares and if you< you do not have the capital which most you do not have the capital which most likely< likely most option Traders do not have likely most option Traders do not have because< because they just want to trade options because they just want to trade options then< then you could get a margin call so this then you could get a margin call so this is< is something you want to avoid as much is something you want to avoid as much as< as possible so the time when there is a as possible so the time when there is a likely< likely chance that you could get early likely chance that you could get early assigned< assigned is when there is lesser assigned is when there is lesser extrinsic< extrinsic value so extrinsic value so extrinsic< extrinsic value is one of the two values extrinsic value is one of the two values that< that makes up of the option right so you that makes up of the option right so you have< have extrinsic value and you have have extrinsic value and you have intrinsic< intrinsic value so what plays a part in intrinsic value so what plays a part in terms< terms of whether you will be early terms of whether you will be early assigned< assigned right a likelihood of getting assigned right a likelihood of getting unassigned< unassigned is if you your extrinsic unassigned is if you your extrinsic value< value is very little and the time when value is very little and the time when the< the extrinsic value is very little is the extrinsic value is very little is when< when it's very close to expiration and when it's very close to expiration and when< when the option is deep in the money when the option is deep in the money right< right so let's say for example the right so let's say for example the market< market goes all the way up and your call market goes all the way up and your call option< option now is very deep in money that's option now is very deep in money that's the< the chance there's a time when you have the chance there's a time when you have very< very little extrinsic value so extrinsic very little extrinsic value so extrinsic value< value we already know will go to zero value we already know will go to zero once< once the option expires so that is why once the option expires so that is why we< we want to use 21 days to express it as we want to use 21 days to express it as a< a marker because as the option gets a marker because as the option gets closer< closer to expression and is less than 21 closer to expression and is less than 21 days< days to expiration that's when the days to expiration that's when the extrinsic< extrinsic value could get very very extrinsic value could get very very little< little and there will be an increased little and there will be an increased chance< chance of getting a sign but if there's chance of getting a sign but if there's more< more than 21 days to expiration then more than 21 days to expiration then there's< there's still quite a bit of extrinsic there's still quite a bit of extrinsic value< value left and there's a lesser chance value left and there's a lesser chance of< of getting assigned now of course that's of getting assigned now of course that's not< not to say that you definitely won't get not to say that you definitely won't get assigned< assigned if it's more than 21 days to assigned if it's more than 21 days to expression< expression remember the other factor is expression remember the other factor is how< how deep in the money this call option how deep in the money this call option is< is if it's already very deep in the is if it's already very deep in the money< money then there's always a chance that money then there's always a chance that even< even though it's more than 21 days to even though it's more than 21 days to expiration< expiration it will still get assigned expiration it will still get assigned but< but the thing is that if you were to but the thing is that if you were to trade< trade around 45 days to expiration each trade around 45 days to expiration each time< time you put on a credit spread then the time you put on a credit spread then the chances< chances are that it won't go so far deep chances are that it won't go so far deep in< in the money that by 21 days to in the money that by 21 days to expression< expression there's not much extrinsic expression there's not much extrinsic value< value left right most of the time value left right most of the time there's< there's still going to be quite a bit of there's still. going to be quite a bit of extrinsic< extrinsic value left that reduces the extrinsic value left that reduces the chances< chances of you getting assigned so the chances of you getting assigned so the first< first marker is less than 21 days to first marker is less than 21 days to expression< expression which means to say if it's expression which means to say if it's more< more than 21 days to expiration even more than 21 days to expiration even though< though it's in the money there's no need though it's in the money there's no need to< to panic chances are you know you won't to panic chances are you know you won't get< get early assigned and you just let the get early assigned and you just let the trade< trade work out right maybe the market trade work out right maybe the market could< could just come back down later on again could just come back down later on again let< let the trade work out in your favor and let the trade work out in your favor and Theta< Theta work for you next is only if your Theta work for you next is only if your short< short strike is tested because as we short strike is tested because as we know< know this is a bear call spread so that know this is a bear call spread so that means< means that anything below the call means that anything below the call option< option if it expires below this call option if it expires below this call option< option you're going to make the max option you're going to make the max profit< profit on this trade so as long as your profit on this trade so as long as your short< short strike is not tested then there is short strike is not tested then there is no< no not necessary for you to roll right no not necessary for you to roll right some< some people are a little bit aggressive some people are a little bit aggressive you< you know if the market let me just you know if the market let me just remove< remove all these drawings down here so remove all these drawings down here so some< some people might you know be inclined some people might you know be inclined to< to roll if the market just comes up down to roll if the market just comes up down here< here you know very close to this shock here you know very close to this shock call< call but it's not actually touched it call but it's not actually touched it yet< yet they might want to roll you know yet they might want to roll you know that's< that's that's also fine as well a little that's that's also fine as well a little bit< bit aggressive but you can definitely do bit aggressive but you can definitely do that< that right and next and the most that right and next and the most important< important part is to ensure that you're important part is to ensure that you're able< able to get a net credit when you're able to get a net credit when you're rolling< rolling credit spreads and I'll share rolling credit spreads and I'll share with< with you a little bit more in detail with you a little bit more in detail later< later on but rolling a credit spread is later on but rolling a credit spread is very< very different from Rolling you know very different from Rolling you know individual< individual shot options let's say for individual shot options let's say for example< example if you do not have this long example if you do not have this long call< call let's say there's no long call here call let's say there's no long call here you< you just have a short call if you were you just have a short call if you were to< to roll this well most of the time when to roll this well most of the time when you< you roll your shot call it will almost you roll your shot call it will almost always< always be for a credit right but when always be for a credit right but when you< you have this long call in play so let you have this long call in play so let me< me just remove this me just remove this so< so when you have this long call in play so when you have this long call in play then< then there's a chance that it could be a then there's a chance that it could be a net< net debit depending on how deep it goes net debit depending on how deep it goes in< in the money and chances are the closer in the money and chances are the closer the< the price is to this long call options the price is to this long call options the< the light clear it is for you to get a the light clear it is for you to get a net< net debit so it's not always that you net debit so it's not always that you can< can get a net credit so this is can get a net credit so this is something< something you need to take note of when something you need to take note of when you< you think of rolling credit spreads all you think of rolling credit spreads all right< right so right so the< the first option right in this case the first option right in this case let's< let's say you can see that the market let's say you can see that the market went< went up right so the market went up and went up right so the market went up and then< then it tested our short call and let's then it tested our short call and let's say< say at this point right you already put say at this point right you already put the< the option on for some time and that's the option on for some time and that's less< less than 21 days so expiration right so less than 21 days so expiration right so assume< assume there's less than 21 days to assume there's less than 21 days to expiration< expiration right right now that's 18 expiration right right now that's 18 days< days to expiration so what you want to days to expiration so what you want to do< do is you could roll out to a further do is you could roll out to a further expiration< expiration date so in this case you roll expiration date so in this case you roll out< out to the nearest 45 days to expiration out to the nearest 45 days to expiration date< date 46 in this case and then you use date 46 in this case and then you use the< the same strike so as you can see down the same strike so as you can see down here< here you could get a net credit right so here you could get a net credit right so a< a net credit again it means that you a net credit again it means that you will< will increase your max profit on the will increase your max profit on the trade< trade and you reduce your max loss on trade and you reduce your max loss on the< the trade and you give your trade the trade and you give your trade additional< additional time to have it work out additional time to have it work out right< right have Theta working for you as well right have Theta working for you as well so< so this is the first option to roll your so this is the first option to roll your credit< credit spread now the second option is credit spread now the second option is that< that if you can you can actually just that if you can you can actually just roll< roll your credit spread up right you can roll your credit spread up right you can roll< roll it to a further a higher strike roll it to a further a higher strike price< price so as you can see down here you price so as you can see down here you can< can roll from the 415 you roll up to the can roll from the 415 you roll up to the 418< 418 to the 423 and you may not get a 418 to the 423 and you may not get a very< very big credit but unless you have a very big credit but unless you have a enough< enough credit right to cover your enough credit right to cover your commission< commission so in this case you're commission so in this case you're probably< probably just rolling for you know net probably just rolling for you know net net< net zero but now it is out of the money net zero but now it is out of the money right< right your call option is now out of right your call option is now out of money< money and then you have an increased money and then you have an increased chance< chance for the trade to work out right chance for the trade to work out right so< so these are the two options that you so these are the two options that you have< have when you're rolling it so this is have when you're rolling it so this is for< for the bad course but for the blue put for the bad course but for the blue put spread< spread is just simply the opposite right spread is just simply the opposite right so< so I'm sure you're able to imagine if so I'm sure you're able to imagine if it's< it's the blue put spread so I don't have it's the blue put spread so I don't have to< to show it on the chart here for you by to show it on the chart here for you by the< the way if you like

com< optionswithdavis.

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video all right next we want back to the video all right next we want to< to get into the pros and cons ounce of to get into the pros and cons ounce of rolling< rolling credit spreads and this is rolling credit spreads and this is something< something that you want to be aware of something that you want to be aware of so< so you can make a decision whether you so you can make a decision whether you want< want to roll your credit spread or not want to roll your credit spread or not because< because not all the time you know you because not all the time you know you always< always want to roll your credit spread always want. to roll your credit spread so< so here are the pros and cons so first so here are the pros and cons so first of< of all the pros is that you can reduce of all the pros is that you can reduce the< the overall risk of the trade and I the overall risk of the trade and I mentioned< mentioned this earlier already so here's mentioned this earlier already so here's an< an example so let's say you have a five an example so let's say you have a five dollar< dollar wide credit spread and you sold dollar wide credit spread and you sold it< it for a dollar fifty cents so the set it for a dollar fifty cents so the set means< means your max risk is 3.

50 so if you means your max risk is 3. 50 so if you were< were to roll for a credit of 25 cents were to. roll for a credit of 25 cents that< that means your max risk is now 3.

25 that means your max risk is now 3. 25 cents< cents because now you have made an cents because now you have made an additional< additional 25 you've taken off 25 cents additional 25 you've taken off 25 cents of< of the risk so in this case it just of the risk so in this case it just means< means your max risk is means your max risk is 325< 325 dollars per credit spread 325 dollars per credit spread and< and it also means that you increase your and it also means that you increase your max< max profit as well so your max profit max profit as well so your max profit will< will now be a dollar 75 cents so this 25 will now be a dollar 75 cents so this 25 cents< cents is also added to your max profit cents is also added to your max profit so< so with each new row so here's a the so with each new row so here's a the cool< cool thing about rolling so if you're cool thing about rolling so if you're able< able to get a net credit each time you able to get a net credit each time you roll< roll then with each new row you'll roll then with each new row you'll further< further reduce your maximum risk and you further reduce your maximum risk and you increase< increase your max profit so it's increase your max profit so it's possible< possible that you can keep rolling until possible that you can keep rolling until the< the risk reward is so much in your favor the risk reward is so much in your favor right< right so not all the time you can keep right so not all the time you can keep doing< doing that because it really depends on doing that because it really depends on where< where the market is at the point of time where the market is at the point of time where< where you want to roll all right and the where you want to roll all right and the last< last Pro is that you give more time for last Pro is that you give more time for the< the trade to work out now the cons so the trade to work out now the cons so the< the cost is that the trade can take a the cost is that the trade can take a long< long time to eventually work out because long time to eventually work out because when< when you first put it on it could be when you first put it on it could be just< just 45 days to expiration right but as just 45 days to expiration right but as you< you keep rolling it over and over again you keep rolling it over and over again you< you keep renewing this cycle as you keep you keep renewing this cycle as you keep renewing< renewing this cycle the time it takes renewing this cycle the time it takes for< for you to eventually get your profit is for you to eventually get your profit is is< is going to keep increasing and is going to keep increasing and increasing< increasing each time you roll so maybe increasing each time you roll so maybe you< you start off with 45 days maybe you're you start off with 45 days maybe you're planning< planning to take out at 21 days so now planning to take out at 21 days so now you< you kept rolling so the whole trade you kept rolling so the whole trade could< could maybe take even months right just could maybe take even months right just for< for you to get that profit so that's one for you to get that profit so that's one of< of the cons can take quite some time and of the cons can take quite some time and you< you will have a lower probability of you will have a lower probability of profit< profit on the new trade so what I mean profit on the new trade so what I mean is< is this right so for example we have a is this right so for example we have a bull< bull put spread so let's say for example bull put spread so let's say for example the< the the market is here and you open a the the market is here and you open a put< put spread down here right so you have a put spread down here right so you have a minus< minus one put and a plus one put down minus one put and a plus one put down here< here so based on this let's say there is here so based on this let's say there is a< a 70 probability of profit that means a a 70 probability of profit that means a 70< 70 win rate now the time when you would 70 win rate now the time when you would roll< roll is usually when the market goes roll is usually when the market goes down< down and then it tests your short strike down and then it tests your short strike right< right so when you test your short strike right so when you test your short strike this< this is when you choose to roll your this is when you choose to roll your credit< credit spread as I've shown you earlier credit spread as I've shown you earlier on< on so when you roll this credit spread on so when you roll this credit spread and< and if you stick to the same strikes and if you stick to the same strikes your< your new trade would still have the same your new trade would still have the same strikes< strikes and all of a sudden now it's no strikes and all of a sudden now it's no longer< longer is 70 because now the market is longer is 70 because now the market is right< right in front of your strike right now right in front of your strike right now you< you are at the money with this trade so you are at the money with this trade so now< now it becomes maybe a 50 trade worker now it becomes maybe a 50 trade worker or< or maybe less than 50 right if you or maybe less than 50 right if you choose< choose to roll it down then maybe you choose to roll it down then maybe you have< have an increased win rate and increase have an increased win rate and increase probably< probably a profit but it will still not probably a profit but it will still not reach< reach this original 70 so which means to reach this original 70 so which means to say< say right if you see rolling as a new say right if you see rolling as a new trade< trade each time when you put on the new trade each time when you put on the new trade< trade you close out the old trade the trade you close out the old trade the new< new trade will always have a lesser new trade will always have a lesser probability< probability of profit so that's one probability of profit so that's one thing< thing you need to take note of and the thing you need to take note of and the last< last coin is that not always right it's last coin is that not always right it's not< not always possible to get an overall not always possible to get an overall net< net credit especially if your short net credit especially if your short strike< strike is in the money so while you strike is in the money so while you always< always get a credit for Rolling the always get a credit for Rolling the short< short strike the debit for Rolling the short strike the debit for Rolling the long< long strike me might be bigger than the long strike me might be bigger than the credit< credit all right so I'm going to give credit all right so I'm going to give you< you an example here on Amazon so for you an example here on Amazon so for this< this stock this stock so< so rolling Credit Express doesn't always so rolling Credit Express doesn't always get< get a credit so as you can see down here get a credit so as you can see down here let's< let's assume that you have a bull put let's assume that you have a bull put spread< spread on for some time already and it's spread on for some time already and it's now< now in the money so now it's in the now in the money so now it's in the money< money and you might be thinking okay I money and you might be thinking okay I want< want to try and roll so if you were to want to try and roll so if you were to look< look at the options to try and roll this look at the options to try and roll this blue< blue put spread all right blue put blue put spread all right blue put spread< spread this is not bad cost but this spread this is not bad cost but this bull< bull spread you notice that it ends up bull spread you notice that it ends up in< in a debit right it ends up in a debit in a debit right it ends up in a debit instead< instead of a credit so all of a sudden instead of a credit so all of a sudden right< right now there's no way for you to roll right now there's no way for you to roll so< so if there's no way for you to roll so if there's no way for you to roll you're< you're pretty much stuck in this you're pretty much stuck in this position< position so if you are stuck in this position so if you are stuck in this position< position you know some people have asked position you know some people have asked before< before so what if I cannot roll for a before so what if I cannot roll for a credit< credit right what if it's a debit do I credit right what if it's a debit do I still< still roll for a debit well this really still roll for a debit well this really depends< depends on you if you think that the depends on you if you think that the market< market is going to come back up by market is going to come back up by Rolling< Rolling you're going to give it more Rolling you're going to give it more time< time that means you're still bullish on time that means you're still bullish on the< the trade then you could maybe to just the trade then you could maybe to just roll< roll for a debit in hopes that the roll for a debit in hopes that the market< market could come back up right but I market could come back up right but I don't< don't really like the idea because you don't really like the idea because you are< are increasing your risk reducing your are increasing your risk reducing your max< max profit now the other thing that you max profit now the other thing that you would< would do it's pretty much just hold on would do it's pretty much just hold on to< to the tree right because you see a to the tree right because you see a credit< credit spread has already an inherent credit spread has already an inherent Max< Max loss inbuilt in place right this is Max loss inbuilt in place right this is not< not a naked put option right let's say not a naked put option right let's say for< for example you don't have a long put for example you don't have a long put down< down here this is a short put a naked down here this is a short put a naked put< put if the market was to go all the way put if the market was to go all the way to< to zero let's say for example it goes to to zero let's say for example it goes to zero< zero then this put down here the zero then this put down here the shot< shot put it's going to lose a lot of shot put it's going to lose a lot of money< money right but this is actually a money right but this is actually a credit< credit spread which means to say you credit spread which means to say you have< have your max loss already inbuilt in have your max loss already inbuilt in place< place so even though if the market goes place so even though if the market goes all< all the way to zero you're only going to all the way to zero you're only going to lose< lose the maximum which you have risk for lose the maximum which you have risk for this< this spread at the start so if your this spread at the start so if your spread< spread is already deep in the money and spread is already deep in the money and then< then you cannot roll for credit guess then you cannot roll for credit guess what< what there's not much you can do right what there's not much you can do right you< you just have to hold on to the trade you just have to hold on to the trade either< either it comes back up or if it doesn't either it comes back up or if it doesn't if< if you decide at 21 days to expiration if you decide at 21 days to expiration you< you don't want to have the risk of early you don't want to have the risk of early assignment< assignment you can close it out remember assignment you can close it out remember you< you do not have to win every single you do not have to win every single trade< trade right some people have messaged me trade right some people have messaged me say< say that you know how do I recover and I say that you know how do I recover and I do< do not have any loss well it's simply do not have any loss well it's simply impossible< impossible if somebody was to tell you impossible if somebody was to tell you that< that they can have zero losses and they that they can have zero losses and they always< always make profit you know I would say always make profit you know I would say there's< there's a red flag you might want to there's a red flag you might want to think< think again trading is. all a game about think again trading is all a game about managing< managing your losses controlling your managing your losses controlling your profits< profits all right so you just have to profits all right so you just have to wait< wait until there's a new setup new wait until there's a new setup new opportunity< opportunity and then enter to your trade opportunity and then enter to your trade make< make sure your risk is well managed so make sure your risk is well managed so that< that in the long term you'll always be that in the long term you'll always be profitable< profitable right in the long run all profitable right in the long run all right< right so let's get back to this so right so let's get back to this so rolling< rolling out this would be a debit now rolling out this would be a debit now let's< let's see what if for example you have let's see what if for example you have the< the other strike you had a lower strike the other strike you had a lower strike your< your boot put spread strike at around your boot put spread strike at around one< one zero two or one zero three in this one zero two or one zero three in this case< case 103 98 so if you try to roll this case 103 98 so if you try to roll this out< out as well you notice that is still a out as well you notice that is still a debit< debit even though it's slightly in the debit even though it's slightly in the money< money so as you can see it's actually money so as you can see it's actually pretty< pretty hard for you to roll for a credit pretty hard for you to roll for a credit and< and the only time when you can roll for and the only time when you can roll for a< a credit is if it's somewhere at the a credit is if it's somewhere at the money< money right you can see it just touch money right you can see it just touch your< your put strike and then if you roll it your put strike and then if you roll it out< out you can get a credit so that is why out you can get a credit so that is why you< you know as a rule of thumb we generally you know as a rule of thumb we generally want< want to rule it once it touches your want to rule it once it touches your strength< strength right if it's less than 21 days strength right if it's less than 21 days to< to expression so this way you know there to expression so this way you know there is< is a chance that you can roll for a is a chance that you can roll for a credit< credit so you might be wondering why is credit so you might be wondering why is it< it that if the market goes below this it that if the market goes below this strike< strike price this short put it becomes a strike price this short put it becomes a debit< debit right you cannot roll for a credit debit right you cannot roll for a credit and< and the reason is because you see when and the reason is because you see when you< you are buying back and and selling you are buying back and and selling another< another uh put for this option down here another uh put for this option down here you< you will get a credit yes you will get a you will get a credit yes you will get a credit credit credit but< but down here what you're doing is that but down here what you're doing is that you< you are remember you are selling off you are remember you are selling off this< this put option you're selling of this this put option you're selling of this production< production and then you are buying back production and then you are buying back a< a further dated put option which is a further dated put option which is going< going to be much more expensive it's going to be much more expensive it's going< going to be much more expensive and going to be much more expensive and that's< that's why it's going to be a debit and that's why it's going to be a debit and if< if the market is closer to this put if the market is closer to this put option< option down here if this Market comes option down here if this Market comes down< down here it's closer to here now this down here it's closer to here now this put< put option is considered at the money put option is considered at the money right< right at the money and if you were to right at the money and if you were to buy< buy and add the money option that is the buy and add the money option that is the most< most expensive option that you can buy most expensive option that you can buy because< because that's when the extrinsic value because that's when the extrinsic value is< is the highest so that is why the net is the highest so that is why the net debit< debit down here what you paid for it's debit down here what you paid for it's going< going to be much more than what you sell going to be much more than what you sell the< the credit for in this option for the the credit for in this option for the shot< shot put so that is why it's going to be shot put so that is why it's going to be a< a net debit now that's another factor a net debit now that's another factor that< that plays a part down here and that is that plays a part down here and that is skew< skew so this is something that you want skew so this is something that you want to< to understand now this is Amazon to understand now this is Amazon and< and a lot of the stocks equities and and a lot of the stocks equities and also< also especially index ETF what they have also especially index ETF what they have is< is what you call put skill so put skill is what you call put skill so put skill just< just means that the strikes at the lower just means that the strikes at the lower strikes< strikes right the lower strikes have strikes right the lower strikes have higher< higher volatility so down here this higher volatility so down here this volatility< volatility will be higher than this volatility will be higher than this volatility< volatility down here right it'll be volatility down here right it'll be higher< higher than this volatility at the shot higher than this volatility at the shot put< put so this is why call puts Q the put so this is why call puts Q the shorts< shorts the lower strikes have higher shorts the lower strikes have higher volatility< volatility and as we already know the volatility and as we already know the options< options value is also contributed by the options value is also contributed by the volatility< volatility the higher the volatility the volatility the higher the volatility the higher< higher the pricing of the options so higher the pricing of the options so what< what you have here is that the lower what you have here is that the lower strikes< strikes is going to have a higher strikes is going to have a higher volatility< volatility which means it's going to be volatility which means it's going to be a< a price more expensive than the options a price more expensive than the options that< that is higher strikes so that is why that is higher strikes so that is why with< with the blue put option you notice what with the blue put option you notice what you're< you're doing is you're selling the you're doing is you're selling the cheaper< cheaper volatility this is slightly cheaper volatility this is slightly lower< lower volatility so you're selling this lower volatility so you're selling this a< a lower velocity and you are buying a a lower velocity and you are buying a higher< higher volatility so what you will find higher volatility so what you will find that< that it's much harder to roll the boot that it's much harder to roll the boot put< put spread on stocks and index ETS with put spread on stocks and index ETS with a< a put skill but it's easier for you to a put skill but it's easier for you to roll< roll for credit on a bear call spread roll for credit on a bear call spread because< because the bad call spread is the because the bad call spread is the opposite< opposite right the bad call spread you opposite right the bad call spread you have< have a minus one call that is a lower have a minus one call that is a lower than< than the call option that you're going than the call option that you're going to< to buy back so down here remember the to buy back so down here remember the volatility< volatility down here is higher than the volatility down here is higher than the volatility< volatility down here so the volatility volatility down here so the volatility down< down here is much higher so I give it down here is much higher so I give it two< two plus here it's just one plus in two plus here it's just one plus in terms< terms of the volatility so that's why terms of the volatility so that's why down< down here you are selling the higher down here you are selling the higher volatility< volatility and you're buying the lower volatility and you're buying the lower volatility< volatility all right so this is one volatility all right so this is one thing< thing you might you need to understand thing you might you need to understand now< now the opposite is true as well if now the opposite is true as well if there's< there's a core skill then you know there's a core skill then you know that's< that's the opposite call skill means the that's the opposite call skill means the blue< blue put spread is going to be easier blue put spread is going to be easier for< for you to roll for a credit whereas for for you to roll for a credit whereas for the< the better call spread it's going to be the better call spread it's going to be harder< harder for you to roll for a credit all harder for you to roll for a credit all right< right this is quite a bit to check in right this is quite a bit to check in but< but if you want to get clarity on this but if you want to get clarity on this just< just rewind find this video watch it just rewind find this video watch it over< over and over again all right so time over and over again all right so time for< for some takeaways so the first takeaway for some takeaways so the first takeaway is< is that rolling credit spreads can is that rolling credit spreads can reduce< reduce your max risk and increase your reduce your max risk and increase your max< max profit and it gives you more time max profit and it gives you more time for< for the trade to work out so this is the for the trade to work out so this is the advantage< advantage of rolling now however Road advantage of rolling now however Road trade< trade will have a lower probability of trade will have a lower probability of profit< profit and since duration has been profit and since duration has been extended< extended it takes a longer time for extended it takes a longer time for profits< profits to be realized so this is the profits to be realized so this is the disadvantage disadvantage disadvantage so< so when you roll you generally want to so when you roll you generally want to only< only consider rolling when the trade is only consider rolling when the trade is generally< generally in a loss or when the price is generally in a loss or when the price is near< near the short strike or in the money near the short strike or in the money basically< basically like I mentioned earlier when basically like I mentioned earlier when it< it touch your short strike and that is it touch your short strike and that is uh< uh also less than 31 days to expression uh also less than 31 days to expression and< and you're able to get an overall credit and you're able to get an overall credit and< and last but not least there is a and last but not least there is a limited< limited window opportunity to get a net limited window opportunity to get a net credit< credit row as I've shown you earlier so credit row as I've shown you earlier so if< if there's put skill it's easier to get if there's put skill it's easier to get a< a net credit role for a better call a net credit role for a better call spread< spread and if there's cold skill it's spread and if there's cold skill it's easier< easier to get a net credit role for your easier to get a net credit role for your bull< bull put spread so that's how you roll bull put spread so that's how you roll credit< credit spreads by the way if you like credit spreads by the way if you like this< this video then you're absolutely going this video then you're absolutely going to< to love this

hacks to help you become five secret hacks to help you become more< more consistently profitable when it more consistently profitable when it comes< comes to trading Credit Express now comes to trading Credit Express now these< these are five things that I actually do these are five things that I actually do not< not see that many people use in their not see that many people use in their trading< trading right so these are five things trading right so these are five things that< that I personally employ in my own that I personally employ in my own trading< trading and I'm seeing very consistent trading and I'm seeing very consistent results< results and I truly believe that if you results and I truly believe that if you were< were to use these five things I'm about were to use these five things I'm about to< to share with you today there's five to share with you today there's five hacks< hacks YouTube will be able to get much hacks YouTube will be able to get much more< more consistent results as well so if more consistent results as well so if you< you have a pen and paper you know just you have a pen and paper you know just take< take that and just take as much notes as take that and just take as much notes as you< you can okay so let's get into the very you can okay so let's get into the very first< first hack so the very first hack is to first hack so the very first hack is to trade< trade only index ETFs now if you have trade only index ETFs now if you have been< been a follower of my channel for some been a follower of my channel for some time< time you will notice that I really like time you will notice that I really like trading< trading index ETFs and that is one of trading index ETFs and that is one of the< the reasons why I'm getting pretty the reasons why I'm getting pretty consistent< consistent results right so why is it consistent results right so why is it that< that trading only index ETFs is going to that trading only index ETFs is going to help< help you become more consistently help you become more consistently profitable< profitable right the very first reason profitable right the very first reason is< is that index ETFs do not move as much is that index ETFs do not move as much as< as individual stocks and tend to stay in as individual stocks and tend to stay in a< a narrower zone so when we are trading a narrower zone so when we are trading such< such kind of strategies like credit such kind of strategies like credit spreads< spreads and even other spreads right spreads and even other spreads right like< like the iron Condor basically these are like the iron Condor basically these are premium< premium selling strategies we generally premium selling strategies we generally do< do not want the market to move that much do not want the market to move that much because< because a lot of the time we are focused because a lot of the time we are focused on< on you know having the spread you know on you know having the spread you know Decay< Decay over time right we're also using Decay over time right we're also using Theta< Theta Decay now credit spread is a Theta Decay now credit spread is a directional< directional trade but it's also a directional trade but it's also a neutral< neutral directional trade which means to neutral directional trade which means to say< say that even though if the market does say that even though if the market does not< not move we are still going to profit not move we are still going to profit over< over time right so that is why we do not over time right so that is why we do not want< want the underlying to move that much as want the underlying to move that much as well< well and if you were to compare this well and if you were to compare this with< with individual stocks you can see down with individual stocks you can see down here< here this graph over here is done by the here this graph over here is done by the tastytrade< tastytrade team so they've done a lot of tastytrade team so they've done a lot of analysis< analysis and Research into this and you analysis and Research into this and you can< can see that when you compare the ETFs can see that when you compare the ETFs to< to the stocks the ETFs actually stay in to the stocks the ETFs actually stay in a< a much more narrow range you can see a much more narrow range you can see this< this is the standard deviation move so this is the standard deviation move so you< you can see this is much more narrow for you can see this is much more narrow for the< the ETFs whereas for the individual the ETFs whereas for the individual stocks< stocks you can see it's much more wider stocks you can see it's much more wider right< right the moves are much more wider now right the moves are much more wider now yes< yes if you were to trade the credit yes if you were to trade the credit spreads< spreads and the market is actually to spreads and the market is actually to move< move you know in the direction that you move you know in the direction that you want< want right let's say for example you want right let's say for example you enter< enter into a bull put spread and the enter into a bull put spread and the stock< stock right let's say you get into the stock right let's say you get into the individual< individual stock and the stock just individual stock and the stock just shoots< shoots all the way up then yes you're shoots all the way up then yes you're going< going to start to profit you know pretty going to start to profit you know pretty quickly< quickly on your credit spread right on quickly on your credit spread right on your< your boot put spread now the thing with your boot put spread now the thing with this< this is that although you could profit this is that although you could profit very< very easily you could also lose very very easily you could also lose very easily< easily if the market actually goes down easily if the market actually goes down so< so that is why with index ETFs although so that is why with index ETFs although if< if the market actually moves against us if the market actually moves against us right< right let's say for example you trade right let's say for example you trade the< the boo boo spread in this case as well the boo boo spread in this case as well if< if the market goes down it doesn't move if the market goes down it doesn't move that< that strongly compared to individual that strongly compared to individual stocks< stocks right so that means to say you stocks right so that means to say you actually< actually still have a chance for the actually still have a chance for the market< market to rebound and the losses will market to rebound and the losses will not< not be as big as compared to stocks not be as big as compared to stocks right< right because the stocks you know right because the stocks you know individual< individual stocks can really move that individual stocks can really move that violently< violently so the other reason is that violently so the other reason is that index< index ETFs aren't affected as much by index ETFs aren't affected as much by earnings< earnings of any single stock in its earnings of any single stock in its composition< composition so the reason why I like composition so the reason why I like index< index ETFs is because there is no index ETFs is because there is no earnings< earnings to really affect the price move earnings to really affect the price move of< of the ETFs so I can you know just of the ETFs so I can you know just continually< continually put them on when I see you continually put them on when I see you know< know it's time for me to enter into a know it's time for me to enter into a bull< bull put spread but if there's you know bull put spread but if there's you know earnings< earnings come out for individual stocks earnings come out for individual stocks then< then you know this is where it becomes a then you know this is where it becomes a little< little bit of a 50 50 shot because the little bit of a 50 50 shot because the research< research done by the tasty trade as well research done by the tasty trade as well they< they have shown that you know if you they have shown that you know if you were< were the trade earnings and the results were the trade earnings and the results are< are pretty much 50 50 as well right are pretty much 50 50 as well right although< although the volatility increase you although the volatility increase you also< also have increased risk in terms of the also have increased risk in terms of the movement< movement right the market can really movement right the market can really shoot< shoot One Direction or another when the shoot One Direction or another when the earnings< earnings comes out so again and this is earnings comes out so again and this is why< why index ETF is a preferred vehicle if why index ETF is a preferred vehicle if you< you want to trade strategies basically you want to trade strategies basically premium< premium selling strategies now next premium selling strategies now next index< index ETFs aren't affected as much by index ETFs aren't affected as much by individual< individual stock news right let's say individual stock news right let's say for< for example a stock has a bad product for example a stock has a bad product launch< launch then that's going to get very launch then that's going to get very very< very negative sentiment and the market very negative sentiment and the market is< is going to punch right pretty much a is going to punch right pretty much a lot< lot of times whenever there's some bad lot of times whenever there's some bad product< product launch or there's a product product launch or there's a product recall< recall then the negative sentiment is recall then the negative sentiment is going< going to take over the market is going going to take over the market is going to< to see this as very bad news and they're to see this as very bad news and they're going< going to just dump the stock so imagine going to just dump the stock so imagine if< if you already have a boot put spread on if you already have a boot put spread on then< then that is going to go way past most then that is going to go way past most likely< likely it's going to go way past your likely it's going to go way past your credit< credit spread but for index ETFs the credit spread but for index ETFs the effect< effect is not going to be that much effect is not going to be that much right< right it's going to be pretty muted right it's going to be pretty muted again< again because there are many stocks in again because there are many stocks in this< this underlying if you trade the index this underlying if you trade the index ETF< ETF I generally think that you're going ETF I generally think that you're going to< to have much more consistent results in to have much more consistent results in your< your p l so this is something that as your p l so this is something that as you< you can see I really employ in my own you can see I really employ in my own training< training strategies in my own trading I training strategies in my own trading I mainly< mainly trade the index ETFs when it mainly trade the index ETFs when it comes< comes to trading spreads okay secret comes to trading spreads okay secret hack< hack number two and that is to exit at hack number two and that is to exit at 21< 21 DTE regardless of the p l so 21 DTE regardless of the p l so exceeding< exceeding at 21 DT is a study that is exceeding at 21 DT is a study that is already< already done by the tastytrade team and already done by the tastytrade team and they< they have really shown that you know they have really shown that you know exiting< exiting at 21 DTE is much more Superior exiting at 21 DTE is much more Superior than< than if you were to exit at expiration than if you were to exit at expiration but< but for some reason many people still but for some reason many people still want< want to hold all the way to expiration want to hold all the way to expiration because< because they think that by holding to because they think that by holding to expiration< expiration you can actually realize the expiration you can actually realize the maximum< maximum profit of the spread right I maximum profit of the spread right I mean< mean why would you want to take it off mean why would you want to take it off early< early when you could hold it for early when you could hold it for slightly< slightly longer and then you can realize slightly longer and then you can realize you< you know the max profit of the trade you know the max profit of the trade right< right so it doesn't make sense straight right so it doesn't make sense straight away< away just by exiting at 21 days right so away just by exiting at 21 days right so here's< here's the thing right why do you want here's the thing right why do you want to< to exit at 21 DT so again the tasty to exit at 21 DT so again the tasty trading< trading have already done all this trading have already done all this research< research and this research is over research and this research is over numerous< numerous years right so they have many numerous years right so they have many many< many data points on this there are many many data points on this there are many many< many trades so that is why you know many trades so that is why you know exiting< exiting at 21 DT is going to show that exiting at 21 DT is going to show that you're< you're going to have better long-term you're going to have better long-term performance< performance which means also higher performance which means also higher returns< returns compared to holding till returns compared to holding till expiration< expiration so as you can see down here expiration so as you can see down here this< this is based on a put spread and this is based on a put spread and although< although the win rate is higher for although the win rate is higher for holding< holding to expiration which makes sense holding to expiration which makes sense right< right because you hold it longer instead right because you hold it longer instead of< of cutting off earlier if you cut off of cutting off earlier if you cut off earlier< earlier what happens is that your profit earlier what happens is that your profit zone< zone is going to be narrower but here's zone is going to be narrower but here's the< the interesting thing right although you the interesting thing right although you cut< cut it off earlier you notice that your cut it off earlier you notice that your return< return is actually higher right you can return is actually higher right you can see< see that you know based on a five dollar see that you know based on a five dollar wide< wide put spread if you would exit the 21 wide put spread if you would exit the 21 DT< DT your return is 47 compared to 33 DT your return is 47 compared to 33 right< right for ten dollars wide right similar right for ten dollars wide right similar as< as well 40 compared to 33 percent and as well 40 compared to 33. percent and the< the reason is because you actually the reason is because you actually manage< manage your average losses much better manage your average losses much better when< when you exit at 21 DTE what happens is when you exit at 21 DTE what happens is that< that you're actually cutting those that you're actually cutting those losses< losses which would have actually you losses which would have actually you know< know become a Max loser expiration well know become a Max loser expiration well you< you cut it short right you cut it much you cut it short right you cut it much shorter< shorter so that you know you can see shorter so that you know you can see that< that the losses are much more smaller that the losses are much more smaller compared< compared to if you were to hold all the compared to if you were to hold all the way< way to expression now of course there way to expression now of course there will< will be certain times whereby you know will be certain times whereby you know you< you cut off the trade early it's a loss you cut off the trade early it's a loss but< but if you held all the way to but if you held all the way to expiration< expiration the trade may actually come expiration the trade may actually come back< back and you're going to be in a profit back and you're going to be in a profit right< right but remember we do not want to right but remember we do not want to take< take a look at each individual trade take a look at each individual trade right< right each individual trade is just a right each individual trade is just a point< point in data over a span of many many point in data over a span of many many trades< trades so we want to look at the big trades so we want to look at the big picture< picture we're going to look over 100 picture we're going to look over 100 trades< trades over 500 trades over 1 000 trades trades over 500 trades over 1 000 trades right< right so in this case this is where you right so in this case this is where you want< want to lean on statistics lean on data want to lean on statistics lean on data and< and as you can see down here this is the and as you can see down here this is the statistics< statistics or a study already done by statistics or a study already done by them< them and you can see if they would them and you can see if they would manage< manage a 21 DTE compared to you know manage a 21 DTE compared to you know holding< holding to expiration over the long term holding to expiration over the long term right< right over a decade long right in this right over a decade long right in this case< case this study is from 2006 to I think case this study is from 2006 to I think around< around 2020 or something like that you around 2020 or something like that you can< can see that 21 DTE eventually can see that 21 DTE eventually outperforms< outperforms the holding to expiration outperforms the holding to expiration right< right and even though let's say for right and even though let's say for example< example they do end up with very similar example they do end up with very similar results< results what you will notice is that the results what you will notice is that the volatility< volatility in your p l is going to be volatility in your p l is going to be much< much lesser right p l in your volatility much lesser right p l in your volatility means< means the swing in your p l right the means the swing in your p l right the last< last thing you want right let's say for last thing you want right let's say for example< example this is your p l volatility this example this is your p l volatility this is< is in terms of dollar and this is in is in terms of dollar and this is in terms< terms of number of Trades so if for terms of number of Trades so if for example< example you're going to have a p l that example you're going to have a p l that goes< goes like this it's going to be so goes like this it's going to be so volatile< volatile right at one time you're going volatile right at one time you're going to< to be profiting that much after that to be profiting that much after that you're< you're gonna drop so much and after that you're gonna drop so much and after that you're< you're gonna make so much again compared you're gonna make so much again compared to< to you know you have a much more to you know you have a much more smoother< smoother p l over the end of the day smoother p l over the end of the day that< that reach your angle right which would that reach your angle right which would you< you prefer right for me because we are you prefer right for me because we are all< all humans and a lot of times many of us all humans and a lot of times many of us cannot< cannot avoid looking at your p l when cannot avoid looking at your p l when you're< you're actually trading it you could you're actually trading it you could actually< actually get affected by it right and actually get affected by it right and when< when you're affected by it that's where when you're affected by it that's where it< it will affect your decision and that's it will affect your decision and that's where< where many of the times it will lead to where many of the times it will lead to wrong< wrong decision so when it comes to wrong decision so when it comes to trading< trading especially we want to be as trading especially we want to be as mechanical< mechanical as possible and not you know mechanical as possible and not you know try< try and be discretionary right the last try and be discretionary right the last thing< thing you want is be too discretionary thing you want is be too discretionary and< and then it's going to be very difficult and then it's going to be very difficult for< for you to you know have a proper you for you to you know have a proper you know< know determination of whether you know know determination of whether you know you're< you're going to do well in the future or you're going to do well in the future or not< not right so as you can see the studies not right so as you can see the studies have< have already shown that 21 DT exiting is have already shown that 21 DT exiting is going< going to have a better performance than going to have a better performance than holding< holding to exploration right so it holding to exploration right so it significantly< significantly reduce the risk of early significantly reduce the risk of early assignment< assignment as well because there's assignment as well because there's always< always a chance that if you have any always a chance that if you have any options< options that's in the money right let's options that's in the money right let's say< say for example you put on a bull put say for example you put on a bull put spread< spread all right minus one put and plus spread all right minus one put and plus one< one put and let's say for example the one put and let's say for example the market< market actually goes down down here and market actually goes down down here and you're< you're hoping that the market would come you're hoping that the market would come back< back up right now what happens is if back up right now what happens is if there's< there's very few days left the there's very few days left the expression< expression right let's say maybe there expression right let's say maybe there is< is seven days to expiration well this is is seven days to expiration well this is the< the time where there's always a the time where there's always a possibility< possibility for you to get a sign and if possibility for you to get a sign and if you're< you're going to get a sign it's going to you're going to get a sign it's going to get< get very messy right because imagine get very messy right because imagine this< this if the market goes down and before this if the market goes down and before the< the market has a chance to actually the market has a chance to actually recover< recover you're actually a sign so all of recover you're actually a sign so all of a< a sudden you do not have you know one a sudden you do not have you know one shot< shot put instead what you have is a shot put instead what you have is a hundred< hundred shares so what's going to happen hundred shares so what's going to happen 100< 100 shares means that you have to 100 shares means that you have to fulfill< fulfill this obligation in terms of our fulfill this obligation in terms of our capital< capital and if you do not have the capital and if you do not have the capital< capital then this is where you're going capital then this is where you're going to< to get into Margin Call the broker is to get into Margin Call the broker is going< going to call you and it's going to get going to call you and it's going to get very< very messy so this is why it's much more very messy so this is why it's much more better< better in terms of objectivity to just better in terms of objectivity to just exit< exit at 21 DT remember we are going to exit at 21 DT remember we are going to have< have some losers as well as you know have some losers as well as you know we're< we're gonna have winners most of a time we're gonna have winners most of a time yes< yes if we are going to put on let's say yes if we are going to put on let's say a< a 30 Delta put spread then the win rate a 30 Delta put spread then the win rate is< is going to be 70 right but that also is going to be 70 right but that also means< means that 30 of the time you're going means that 30 of the time you're going to< to lose money so you do not want to to lose money so you do not want to force< force a winner for every single trade force a winner for every single trade that< that you put on next it keeps your that you put on next it keeps your trading< trading mechanical instead of being trading mechanical instead of being discretionary< discretionary which can lead to analysis discretionary which can lead to analysis paralysis< paralysis right so how many times have paralysis right so how many times have you< you actually put on a trade and just you actually put on a trade and just wonder< wonder you know should I hold on to it wonder you know should I hold on to it should< should I exit it is this p l enough is should I exit it is this p l enough is this< this p l too little So to avoid all that this p l too little So to avoid all that stuff< stuff you know exiting at 21 DT just stuff you know exiting at 21 DT just makes< makes it mechanical and you just lean on makes it mechanical and you just lean on the< the fact that the research has already the fact that the research has already been< been done the statistics have already been done the statistics have already been< been proven that you can actually get been proven that you can actually get better< better results than holding to better results than holding to expiration expiration expiration so< so just lean on that now you might be so just lean on that now you might be asking< asking you know if we were to exit at 21 asking you know if we were to exit at 21 DTE< DTE right let's say for example if you DTE right let's say for example if you put< put on at 45 days and you were to exit put on at 45 days and you were to exit it< it at 21 DTE that would mean that you're it at 21 DTE that would mean that you're effectively< effectively holding it for only what 24 effectively holding it for only what 24 days< days right so if that's the case why not days right so if that's the case why not just< just trade a shorter DTE and hold your just trade a shorter DTE and hold your expiration< expiration right basically just hold the expiration right basically just hold the 24< 24 DT all the way to expiration treat 24 DT all the way to expiration treat this< this DTE instead of you know putting on this DTE instead of you know putting on 45< 45 days and exiting a 21 DTE so that is 45 days and exiting a 21 DTE so that is a< a very good question and in fact this is a very good question and in fact this is a< a question that the tasty trade team a question that the tasty trade team actually< actually gets a lot so that is why they actually gets a lot so that is why they have< have already done a study on this right have already done a study on this right so< so they did a study to compare trading so they did a study to compare trading short< short duration versus you know exiting short duration versus you know exiting at< at 21 DTE so you can see the blue line at 21 DTE so you can see the blue line down< down here shows that you enter at 45 DTE down here shows that you enter at 45 DTE and< and you exit at 21 DTE and the green and you exit at 21 DTE and the green line< line down here is where you basically line down here is where you basically just< just hold to 24 just hold to 24 DT< DT all the way to expiration so in terms DT all the way to expiration so in terms of< of holding the number of days the trade of holding the number of days the trade is< is the same but you can see that the is the same but you can see that the performance< performance of the 45 DTE and then you performance of the 45 DTE and then you exit< exit at 21 DT is so much more Superior exit at 21 DT is so much more Superior than< than if you were to trade you know just than if you were to trade you know just the< the 24 DT and hold to expiration so if the 24 DT and hold to expiration so if you're< you're wondering about that well I hope you're wondering about that well I hope this< this have resolved your question in your this have resolved your question in your head< head and just go ahead to do the you head and just go ahead to do the you know< know the longer term one and then just know the longer term one and then just exit< exit at 21 DTE now the next hack is to exit at 21 DTE now the next hack is to trade< trade price extremes by the way if you trade price extremes by the way if you like< like this video so far Please Subscribe

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video so what I mean by back to the video so what I mean by trading< trading price extremes so basically trading price extremes so basically trading< trading price extreme means to only trading price extreme means to only enter< enter into a credit spread when the enter into a credit spread when the market< market has made an over extended move market has made an over extended move right< right either to the upside or to the right either to the upside or to the downside< downside and the reason for this is downside and the reason for this is because< because credit spreads are actually because credit spreads are actually directional< directional trades basically you want it directional trades basically you want it to< to move in the opposite direction of to move in the opposite direction of where< where your trade is so if you put on a where your trade is so if you put on a boot< boot put spread you want the market to boot put spread you want the market to generally< generally go up and you put on a bad generally go up and you put on a bad call< call spread you want the markets to go call spread you want the markets to go down< down and one thing we know also is that down and one thing we know also is that for< for Price action price do not just move for Price action price do not just move in< in a straight line right price will in a straight line right price will always< always go up come down go up come down always go up come down go up come down go< go up come down and sometimes there's go up come down and sometimes there's also< also the reversals so basically we want also the reversals so basically we want to< to take advantage of this over extended to take advantage of this over extended move< move to enter into credit spreads this move to enter into credit spreads this way< way you will have a higher probability way you will have a higher probability of< of succeeding right so what do I mean of succeeding right so what do I mean right< right so for example if the market has right so for example if the market has kept< kept going up without much retracement kept going up without much retracement then< then this is where you can consider then this is where you can consider entering< entering into a bad call spread and on entering into a bad call spread and on the< the other hand if the market has kept the other hand if the market has kept going< going down without much retracement then going down without much retracement then this< this is where you can consider entering this is where you can consider entering into< into a bull put spread right so the last into a bull put spread right so the last thing< thing you want is to enter you know when thing you want is to enter you know when the< the market is going sideways right the market is going sideways right because< because as we know if the market is to because as we know if the market is to go< go sideways then most of the time this go sideways then most of the time this is< is the time where the market will find is the time where the market will find some< some breakout in either direction right some breakout in either direction right so< so that is why we want to First identify so that is why we want to First identify you< you know the over extended move before you know the over extended move before entering< entering into our credit spread so the entering into our credit spread so the question< question is how do you identify price question is how do you identify price extremes< extremes okay so there are two ways that extremes okay so there are two ways that you< you can actually identify this price you can actually identify this price extremes< extremes the first way is using the extremes the first way is using the stochastic< stochastic oscillator in conjunction stochastic oscillator in conjunction with< with the price movement right so as you with the price movement right so as you can< can see down here this is clearly a very can see down here this is clearly a very big< big move right by any standards you can big move right by any standards you can see< see that the candlesticks are so much see that the candlesticks are so much longer< longer than the one previously you can longer than the one previously you can see< see all this all bunched up and again as see all this all bunched up and again as I< I mentioned just now whenever the price I mentioned just now whenever the price are< are all bunched up this is when the are all bunched up this is when the price< price is consolidating waiting for a price is consolidating waiting for a breakout< breakout in either direction so you do breakout in either direction so you do not< not want to enter a credit spread during not want to enter a credit spread during this< this congestion wait for it to actually this congestion wait for it to actually have< have the move then you want to confirm have the move then you want to confirm it< it with your stochastic oscillator right it with your stochastic oscillator right so< so as you can see down here there's a so as you can see down here there's a big< big move down then you see that the big move down then you see that the market< market is over sold then this is where market is over sold then this is where you< you can consider getting into a bull put you can consider getting into a bull put spread< spread because a lot of the times right spread because a lot of the times right most< most of the time but not all the time most of the time but not all the time most< most of the time when the market goes most of the time when the market goes down< down with such kind of big moves usually down with such kind of big moves usually there< there tends to be a bounce back up again there tends to be a bounce back up again right< right so if you were able to catch it right so if you were able to catch it right< right at the bottom basically when you right at the bottom basically when you see< see this over extended move and you see this over extended move and you confirm< confirm it with the stochastic confirm it with the stochastic oscillator< oscillator then you can enter into a oscillator then you can enter into a bull< bull put spread similarly if the market bull put spread similarly if the market is< is to go up right without much is to go up right without much retracement< retracement and you see that hey it's retracement and you see that hey it's overbought< overbought then you can consider putting overbought then you can consider putting into< into a bear call spread right so again into a bear call spread right so again it's< it's not going to work all the time but it's not going to work all the time but it's< it's going to work enough time so that it's going to work enough time so that you< you know at the end of the day you're you know at the end of the day you're going< going to be profitable now a lot of going to be profitable now a lot of people< people have asked before hey Davis what people have asked before hey Davis what is< is the settings that you use for your is the settings that you use for your stochastic< stochastic oscillator can you share me stochastic oscillator can you share me so< so I've already created a video on this so I've already created a video on this so< so if you are curious you know just go so if you are curious you know just go ahead< ahead to my channel and just type ahead to my channel and just type stochastic< stochastic right and you will see stochastic right and you will see there's< there's one video that I've already there's one video that I've already created< created on it now the other way to created on it now the other way to identify< identify price extremes is by using what identify price extremes is by using what I< I call the income grid so income grip is I call the income grid so income grip is basically< basically my own way of identifying you basically my own way of identifying you know< know entries in the market right is a know entries in the market right is a very< very proprietary tool for myself so very proprietary tool for myself so basically< basically what I'll do is I'll just draw basically what I'll do is I'll just draw the< the slides in the underlying that I want the slides in the underlying that I want to< to trade and I just want to see you know to trade and I just want to see you know how< how much movement that it has made right how much movement that it has made right basically< basically I'm looking for the price basically I'm looking for the price movement< movement to break through you know all movement to break through you know all these< these levels right so all these lines these levels right so all these lines are< are considered levels so if it breaks are considered levels so if it breaks through< through many levels without much through many levels without much retracement< retracement then that is where I would retracement then that is where I would see< see it as being over extended because see it as being over extended because most< most of the time a normal market most of the time a normal market movement< movement would be bouncing back and movement would be bouncing back and forth< forth right you can see down here it forth right you can see down here it bounce< bounce back and forth within the bounce back and forth within the different< different levels so this is what I call different levels so this is what I call you< you know generally this is a normal you know generally this is a normal movement< movement right movement right so< so a movement where it's overextended is so a movement where it's overextended is where< where it will go through all this level where it will go through all this level without< without much retracement and then this without much retracement and then this is< is where you can consider getting into a is where you can consider getting into a credit< credit spread right so if the market credit spread right so if the market moves< moves all the way up you can consider moves all the way up you can consider getting< getting into a bad call spread and then getting into a bad call spread and then if< if the market goes all the way down you if the market goes all the way down you get< get into a bull put spread and in fact get into a bull put spread and in fact this< this is a trade that I actually got in this is a trade that I actually got in right< right I got into the shot put version right I got into the shot put version not< not the put spread and I actually not the put spread and I actually created< created a video on this as well right created a video on this as well right where< where I talk about how I use the income where I talk about how I use the income grid< grid to find over extended moves right grid to find over extended moves right this< this kind of opportunities and then just this kind of opportunities and then just enter< enter into the trade so if you're enter into the trade so if you're curious< curious you know about that video you curious you know about that video you can< can go ahead again to my channel and can go ahead again to my channel and just< just search for that okay secret hack just search for that okay secret hack number< number four and that is stagger entries number four and that is stagger entries now< now this is something that I don't hear now this is something that I don't hear that< that many people talk about in fact I that many people talk about in fact I haven't< haven't seen any video on YouTube that haven't seen any video on YouTube that people< people talk about staggering entries and people talk about staggering entries and basically< basically what it is is that if you have basically what it is is that if you have enough< enough Capital to trade more than one enough Capital to trade more than one credit< credit spread now instead of entering credit spread now instead of entering all< all positions at one place instead what all positions at one place instead what you< you want to do is stagger your entry as you want to do is stagger your entry as the< the market continues going up or down the market continues going up or down right< right so I'm going to give you an right so I'm going to give you an example< example here so for example let's say example here so for example let's say you< you have enough Capital to trade two you have enough Capital to trade two blue< blue put spreads so instead of entering blue put spreads so instead of entering both< both at one time what you want to do is both at one time what you want to do is you< you just enter one of them first right you just enter one of them first right so< so let's say it's a five point wide so let's say it's a five point wide spread< spread right let's say it's a five point spread right let's say it's a five point wide< wide bull put spread and then you are wide bull put spread and then you are receiving< receiving a dollar fifty cents for your receiving a dollar fifty cents for your credit< credit so if you receive a dollar fifty credit so if you receive a dollar fifty cents< cents in terms of a credit cents in terms of a credit right< right what it leaves is three dollars right what it leaves is three dollars fifty< fifty cents in terms of risk per put fifty cents in terms of risk per put credit< credit spread so what it means is that credit spread so what it means is that your< your max risk per credit spread per put your max risk per credit spread per put spread< spread is 350 so let's say for example spread is 350 so let's say for example your< your risk per trade is actually seven your risk per trade is actually seven hundred< hundred dollars right you can reach 700 hundred dollars right you can reach 700 on< on each trade so instead of putting on on each trade so instead of putting on two< two put spread you could enter one first two put spread you could enter one first down< down here right let's say for example down here right let's say for example you< you identify this as a setup for you to you identify this as a setup for you to enter< enter into put spread so what you want enter into put spread so what you want to< to do is you enter one of them first so to do is you enter one of them first so let's< let's say maybe this one is at 40 DTE let's say maybe this one is at 40 DTE and< and then as the market goes down again and then as the market goes down again what< what you want to do is enter into what you want to do is enter into another< another put. spread so right now you another put spread so right now you already< already have your risk allocated right already have your risk allocated right because< because you have decided hey you want to because you have decided hey you want to reach< reach 700 now you have seven hundred reach 700 now you have seven hundred dollars< dollars for this two combined so what dollars for this two combined so what you< you notice is that for the second one I you notice is that for the second one I use< use a 55 DTE instead a 40 DTE so what it use a 55 DTE instead a 40 DTE so what it does< does is that it adds further does is that it adds further diversification< diversification into your trade right diversification into your trade right because< because the first one is 40 DTE so these because the first one is 40 DTE so these two< two have different exit points right so two have different exit points right so if< if you were to use exiting at 21 DTE if you were to use exiting at 21 DTE then< then this will exit first then this will then this will exit first then this will exit< exit later so what it does is that it exit later so what it does is that it avoids< avoids the scenario whereby both could avoids the scenario whereby both could possibly< possibly lose right so don't forget you possibly lose right so don't forget you know< know when your training put spread we know when your training put spread we have< have time involved as well so that means have time involved as well so that means the< the market may continue to go down but the market may continue to go down but then< then it may not be 21 DTE yet so at this then it may not be 21 DTE yet so at this point< point maybe you have to exit this one point maybe you have to exit this one first< first but then later on the market as first but then later on the market as time< time passes it actually goes up then now time passes it actually goes up then now your< your second put spread is actually in a your second put spread is actually in a profit< profit so in this case you lose one you profit so in this case you lose one you make< make one at least you aggregate your p l make one at least you aggregate your p l compared< compared to if you had two contracts at compared to if you had two contracts at this< this point let me just delete this this point let me just delete this drawing< drawing now compare this to if you have drawing now compare this to if you have two< two contracts at this point right if you two contracts at this point right if you have< have two contracts at this point and if have two contracts at this point and if the< the market does go all the way down and the market does go all the way down and let's< let's say it's around 21 DTE already let's say it's around 21 DTE already then< then you're going to lose on both of it then you're going to lose on both of it right< right but if you have uh staggered your right but if you have uh staggered your entries< entries in this case then there's always entries in this case then there's always a< a chance to second one is going to be in a chance to second one is going to be in profit< profit and the best scenario is whereby profit and the best scenario is whereby both< both actually profit right this one goes both actually profit right this one goes down< down and by the time it's about 21 DT down and by the time it's about 21 DT before< before you get out this is profitable before you get out this is profitable all< all right this will be profitable but all right this will be profitable but this< this second trade will be even more this second trade will be even more profitable< profitable because now it's even more profitable because now it's even more out< out of the money right so again this is out of the money right so again this is how< how you can minimize your p l volatility how you can minimize your p l volatility and< and your results is going to be much and your results is going to be much more< more consistent so by staggering entries more consistent so by staggering entries you< you are actually diversifying your you are actually diversifying your entries< entries vertically so I'll talk about entries vertically so I'll talk about this< this in many other videos as well which this in many other videos as well which results< results in a smoother p l compared to results in a smoother p l compared to entering< entering all your trades at once now the entering all your trades at once now the last< last but not least the last secret hack last but not least the last secret hack number< number five and that is to stagger your number five and that is to stagger your exits< exits so we have already talked about exits so we have already talked about staggering< staggering entries but now you can also staggering entries but now you can also stagger< stagger your exit so what do you mean by stagger your exit so what do you mean by staggering< staggering your exit so first of all staggering your exit so first of all this< this is to be used in conjunction with this is to be used in conjunction with the< the 21 DTE exit rule right so let's say the 21 DTE exit rule right so let's say you< you have decided that all your trades you have decided that all your trades are< are going to exit at 21 DTE now if you are going to exit at 21 DTE now if you were< were to do it this way what might happen were to do it this way what might happen is< is that if you're going to trade across is that if you're going to trade across many< many different stocks you're going to many different stocks you're going to find< find that you're going to have many find that you're going to have many positions< positions that have the same DTE so if positions that have the same DTE so if you< you were to exit all of them at 21 DTE you were to exit all of them at 21 DTE it< it could be a little bit of a risk so to it could be a little bit of a risk so to speak< speak because what happens you know if speak because what happens you know if at< at 21 DT the market so happens to you at 21 DT the market so happens to you know< know be adverse to your position right know be adverse to your position right it< it moves adversely to your position the it moves adversely to your position the last< last few days and all of them is going last few days and all of them is going to< to be in a loss right so if you're going to be in a loss right so if you're going to< to exit all the Tehran DTS like putting to exit all the Tehran DTS like putting all< all your eggs you know in one basket but all your eggs you know in one basket but if< if you were to stagger your exits what if you were to stagger your exits what you< you actually do is you're going to you actually do is you're going to minimize< minimize this risk as well as your p l minimize this risk as well as your p l fluctuation< fluctuation your p l volatility is going fluctuation your p l volatility is going to< to be much more smoother so you're going to be much more smoother so you're going to< to exit them gradually as you get closer to exit them gradually as you get closer to< to the 21 DTE so here's what I mean so to the 21 DTE so here's what I mean so let's< let's say for example you have put on on let's say for example you have put on on seven< seven different stocks right so seven seven different stocks right so seven different< different stocks from a to G and they're different stocks from a to G and they're all< all around the same te so you pull up all around the same te so you pull up your< your positions Tab and you see that all your positions Tab and you see that all of< of them are at 25 DTE right so instead of them are at 25 DTE right so instead of< of exiting all of them at 21 DTE you of exiting all of them at 21 DTE you start< start exiting them one by one starting start exiting them one by one starting from< from this date right so maybe on this from this date right so maybe on this day< day you close out one position first day you close out one position first then< then you hold on the rest to the next then you hold on the rest to the next day< day and now it becomes 24 DTE then you day and now it becomes 24 DTE then you close< close out the next one right then you close out the next one right then you hold< hold on the rest for another day then hold on the rest for another day then again< again there's 23 DTE left you close out again there's 23 DTE left you close out that< that position and again you hold on to that position and again you hold on to another< another day 22 DTE you close out that so another day 22 DTE you close out that so on< on and so forth right so gradually what on and so forth right so gradually what you're< you're going to do is that you're going you're going to do is that you're going to< to close the position slowly over time to close the position slowly over time and< and what it does is that it actually and what it does is that it actually captures< captures you know your p l at different captures you know your p l at different stages< stages at different points in time right stages at different points in time right so< so maybe had you all closed out at 21 so maybe had you all closed out at 21 DTE< DTE it could have been all at a loss DTE it could have been all at a loss right< right if it's all eternity DTE but right if it's all eternity DTE but because< because you have actually closed up one because you have actually closed up one earlier< earlier this could have captured some earlier this could have captured some profit< profit first and then this one maybe profit first and then this one maybe again< again it's much more profitable then again it's much more profitable then you're< you're going to get you know much more you're going to get you know much more profits< profits down here but then later the profits down here but then later the market< market starts to take a downturn right market starts to take a downturn right assuming< assuming all these are put spread by the assuming all these are put spread by the way< way then down here maybe it's going to way then down here maybe it's going to start< start to make slightly less money start to make slightly less money and< and then down here maybe you start to and then down here maybe you start to have< have you know you start to lose money have you know you start to lose money again< again then down here again maybe you again then down here again maybe you start< start to lose money then the market goes start to lose money then the market goes back< back up again it starts gonna make money back up again it starts gonna make money again< again and then the market you know again and then the market you know really< really recovers and then you're gonna really recovers and then you're gonna make< make more profits down here by the way make more profits down here by the way all< all these are all dollar signs some all these are all dollar signs some people< people have mentioned you know David people have mentioned you know David stopped< stopped drawing the dollar sign I know I stopped drawing the dollar sign I know I should< should stop doing that but hey this is a should stop doing that but hey this is a way< way for me to show profits right so way for me to show profits right so basically< basically when you stanker your exits basically when you stanker your exits what< what you're going to notice is that what you're going to notice is that you're< you're going to have a much more you're going to have a much more smoother< smoother p l and this is also going to smoother p l and this is also going to lead< lead you to a much more consistent piano lead you to a much more consistent piano right< right so this is not entries this is right so this is not entries this is exits< exits right so this is what I personally exits right so this is what I personally do< do as well especially you know I manage do as well especially you know I manage anywhere< anywhere from 10 to 20 sometimes when anywhere from 10 to 20 sometimes when the< the market gets very volatile and this the market gets very volatile and this is< is where you know I want to stagger my is where you know I want to stagger my exits< exits so this way I do not get all cut exits so this way I do not get all cut out< out at one point now of course if you're out at one point now of course if you're lucky< lucky right at 21 DT it could be the lucky right at 21 DT it could be the highest< highest point of your p l but you cannot highest point of your p l but you cannot guarantee< guarantee that for every time you exit guarantee that for every time you exit 21< 21 DTE so that is why instead of you 21 DTE so that is why instead of you know< know putting all your eggs in one basket know putting all your eggs in one basket just< just gradually exit them and over time just gradually exit them and over time you< you will see that you have a smoother p you will see that you have a smoother p l< l and you will definitely have much more l and you will definitely have much more consistent< consistent results because of this so consistent results because of this so Guys< Guys these are the five hacks use them Guys these are the five hacks use them and< and let me know how it turns out for you and let me know how it turns out for you by< by the way if you like this video then by the way if you like this video then you're<

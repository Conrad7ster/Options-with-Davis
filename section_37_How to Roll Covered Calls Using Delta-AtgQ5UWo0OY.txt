### How to Roll Covered Calls Using Delta-AtgQ5UWo0OY
=====================================================

Language: en hey< hey guys davis here so if you've been hey guys davis here so if you've been wondering< wondering uh when you should roll your wondering uh when you should roll your cover< cover calls or if you should even be cover calls or if you should even be rolling< rolling your covered calls in the first rolling your covered calls in the first place< place then one good way you can use to place then one good way you can use to determine< determine that is by using one of the determine that is by using one of the option< option greeks which. is delta so what is option greeks which is delta so what is delta< delta delta basically just measures the delta delta basically just measures the rate< rate of change in an options theoretical rate of change in an options theoretical value< value per one dollar change in the value per one dollar change in the underlying< underlying security and bullish option underlying security and bullish option strategies< strategies have positive delta so let's strategies have positive delta so let's say< say you decided to buy a call option on say you decided to buy a call option on nike< nike with a delta of 0. 8 for 13 nike with a delta of 0.

8 for 13 now< now this is a deep in the money call now this is a deep in the money call option option option so< so let's say if nike was to go up a so let's say if nike was to go up a dollar< dollar that means that your call option dollar that means that your call option would< would gain 80 cents and it would become would gain 80 cents and it would become 13 13 13 80< 80 cents 80 cents and< and all else being equal that's because and all else being equal that's because there< there are other factors that actually there are other factors that actually affect< affect the pricing of the options like affect the pricing of the options like for< for example volatility so if all else for example. volatility so if all else being< being equal then your option will gain being equal then your option will gain by< by the delta that your option has and if by the delta that your option has and if nike< nike was to go down a dollar then your nike was to go down a dollar then your call< call option would lose 80 cents and that call option would lose 80 cents and that would< would become 12 dollars 20 cents would become 12 dollars 20 cents now< now bearish option strategies on the now bearish option strategies on the other< other hand have negative deltas so for other hand have negative deltas so for example< example you bought a put option on nike example you bought a put option on nike with< with a delta of negative 0. 5 for four with a delta of negative 0.

5 for four dollars< dollars so that means you want the dollars so that means you want the market< market to actually drop because if market to actually drop because if you're< you're long a put option if the market you're long a put option if the market drops< drops you make money if the market. goes drops you make money if the market goes up< up you lose money up you lose money so< so if nike was to go down a dollar then so if nike was to go down a dollar then your< your options would theoretically lose 50 your options would theoretically lose 50 cents< cents becoming 3. 50 cents and if nike cents becoming 3.

50 cents and if nike was< was to go down one dollar then your was to go down. one dollar then your options< options would gain 50 cents becoming options would gain 50 cents becoming 4. 50 4.

50 4. 50 now< now cover call options uh cover call now cover call options uh cover call this< this strategy in general is a positive this strategy in general is a positive it< it is a bullish strategy but when you it is a bullish strategy but when you log< log into your brokerage log into your brokerage software< software you would see that it has a software you would see that it has a negative< negative delta and the reason is because negative delta and the reason is because this< this is in essence just a short call a this is in essence just a short call a cover< cover call option strategy cover call option strategy consists< consists of the long stock portion and consists of the long stock portion and the< the short call so the long stock portion the short call so the long stock portion is< is where you get a hundred deltas and is where you get a hundred deltas and you< you were to square off with the short you were to square off with the short call call call let's< let's say the short call here is a let's say the short call here is a negative< negative 21 so you have roughly a negative 21 so you have roughly a positive< positive 80 delta so in general cover positive 80 delta so in general cover call< call strategy is a bullish strategy but call strategy is a bullish strategy but on< on your platform you will see your call on your platform you will see your call as< as a negative delta because it is a as a negative delta because it is a short< short call and in general if you do not short call and in general if you do not want< want your stock to be called away you do want your stock to be called away you do not< not want the stock. to climb up past your not want the stock to climb up past your covered< covered call strike covered call strike so< so why do you want to use delta to roll so why do you want to use delta to roll cover< cover calls well first of all it's a cover calls well first of all it's a very< very simple metric to manage multiple very simple metric to manage multiple covered< covered call positions because delta covered call positions because delta will< will let you know if you should roll will let you know if you should roll your< your covered calls or not your covered calls or not and< and because of that there's no need to and because of that there's no need to look< look at charts so for example if you look at charts so for example if you were< were to see your cover call positions were to see your cover call positions and< and you see that it has lesser than 50 and you see that it has lesser than 50 deltas< deltas then you know that the cover call deltas then you know that the cover call is< is out of the money you know at this is out of the money you know at this point< point of time there's pretty much point of time there's pretty much nothing< nothing to do you can just nothing to do you can just let< let it expire out of money see until the let it expire out of money see until the expiration< expiration date if it's still under 50 expiration date if it's still under 50 deltas< deltas that means you collect the full deltas that means you collect the full credit< credit as it expires worthless credit as it expires worthless now< now if you see that your cover call has now if you see that your cover call has a< a delta of 0.

5 that means the stock has a delta of 0. 5 that means the stock has climbed< climbed all the way to your strike price climbed all. the way to your strike price and< and if you see a delta of more than 0.

8 and if you see a delta of more than 0. 8 that< that means you see a negative 0.

8 that means you see a negative 0. 8 negative< negative 0.

9 negative 0. 9 then< then your then your strike< strike price has been breached you know strike price has been breached you know the< the stock has gone above the stock has gone above your< your stride and if you do not roll your stride and if you do not roll you< you will get exercise that means your you will get exercise that means your stock< stock will get called away at your stock will get called away at your strike< strike price at expiration strike price at expiration so< so we will be using this as a way to so we will be using this as a way to determine< determine whether you should be rolling determine whether you should be rolling and< and when you should be rolling your and when you should be rolling your cover< cover calls cover calls so< so when do you roll. and this comes down so when do you roll and this comes down to< to the objective that you have in to the objective that you have in general< general there are two objectives general there are two objectives the< the first objective is that you want to the first objective is that you want to hold< hold on to the stock you know you like hold on to the stock you know you like the< the stock so much and you want to hold the stock so much and you want to hold this< this as a long term investment so if this as a long term investment so if this< this is the case and you see that your this is the case and you see that your covered< covered call has a delta of less than covered call has a delta of less than 0.

#### Topic 1

5< 0. 5 well at this point there are three 0.

5 well at this point there are three things< things you can do right the first option things you can do right the first option is< is that you can just let it expire is that you can just let it expire worthless< worthless right you can just leave it worthless right you can just leave it as< as you get closer to the expiration date as you get closer to the expiration date if< if it's still out of the money you can if it's still out of the money you can collect< collect the full credit collect the full credit if< if it expires out of the money that's if it expires out of the money that's the< the first option now the second option the first option now the second option is< is that you can consider taking profit is that you can consider taking profit right< right some people like to take profit at right some people like to take profit at 50 50 50 some< some people like to take profit at 90 so some people like to take profit at 90 so this< this is a personal preference and the this is a personal preference and the reason< reason some people like to take profit reason some people like to take profit is< is because number one they could be is because number one they could be worried< worried that the stock will suddenly worried that the stock will suddenly rally< rally and they do not want their stock rally and they do not want their stock to< to be called away so to take profit or to be called away so to take profit or number< number two number two it< it could be that you know you're making it could be that you know you're making more more more in< in terms of dollar per day in terms of dollar per day if< if you were to take profit at that point if you were to take profit at that point in< in time so let's say you sold the in time so let's say you sold the covered< covered call for a dollar and. it is a 30 covered call for a dollar and it is a 30 days< days to expiration option and within the days to expiration option and within the first first first say say say seven< seven days seven days you< you would have you already realized you would have you already realized fifty< fifty percent of the profit so fifty percent of the profit so it< it makes more sense at that point time it makes more sense at that point time to< to just close the option and take fifty to just close the option and take fifty percent< percent of the profit percent of the profit in< in seven days then to wait another 23 in seven days then to wait another 23 days days days to< to get the other 50 to get the other 50 so< so again this is personal preference and so again this is personal preference and it< it comes down to how you would like to it comes down to how you would like to manage< manage it manage it now< now the third option is that if your now the third option is that if your stock< stock has stock has been< been dropping especially in a bear been dropping especially in a bear market< market or when the market has crashed market or when the market has crashed then< then you might want to consider rolling then you might want to consider rolling down< down to try and get more credit and down to try and get more credit and cushion< cushion the cushion the capital< capital loss that you have on your stock capital loss that you have on your stock all< all right not really a capital loss but all right not really a capital loss but more< more of a drawdown so you're just using more of a drawdown so you're just using the the the credit< credit that you get from your cover call credit that you get from your cover call to< to reduce the cost basis of your stock to reduce the cost basis of your stock now now now what< what if the delta reaches 0. 5 what this what if the delta reaches 0.

5 what this means< means is that means is that the< the stock has climbed all the way to the stock has climbed all the way to your< your strike price and if you do not want your strike price and if you do not want to< to have a chance that your stock is to to have a chance that your stock is to be< be called away then this is where you be called away then this is where you want< want to consider rolling want to consider rolling so< so how you would do the row would be to so how you would do the row would be to roll< roll up and out for either a credit or roll up and out for either a credit or break< break even so to roll up and out break even so to roll up and out is< is pretty simple what it just means is is pretty simple what it just means is that that that you're< you're basically going to roll to a you're basically going to roll to a higher< higher strike price and then to a higher strike price and then to a further< further expiration date so if you want further expiration date so if you want to< to know about the different types of to know about the different types of rolling< rolling terminology rolling terminology uh< uh there's a video that i've already uh there's a. video that i've already created< created you can click somewhere created you can click somewhere on< on this video on this video and< and i will and in that video it will and i will and in that video it will share< share with you all the different types share with you all the different types of< of role now of role now this< this is what you want to do if you want this is what you want to do if you want to< to hold on to the stock to hold on to the stock now< now what if you do not mind having your now what if you do not mind having your stock< stock called away right you have stock called away right you have probably probably probably made< made quite a bit on the stock already made quite a bit on the stock already the< the stock has already gone up quite a the stock has already gone up quite a bit< bit and you want to just sell off this bit and you want to just sell off this stock< stock so that you can move on to the stock so that you can move on to the next< next position well in this case if you next position well in this case if you see< see that your covered call has a delta see that your covered call has a delta of< of a less than 0. 5 and it's out of the of a less than 0.

5 and it's out of the money< money you do the same as though as you money you do the same as though as you know< know as the previous objective that you know as the previous objective that you do< do not want your stock to be called away do not want your stock to be called. away right< right it's exactly the same options right it's exactly the same options the< the only difference is that this time the only difference is that this time we< we can let the covered call actually get we can let the covered call actually get in< in the money to about in the money to about 0. 8< 0.

8 deltas and the reason we allow it to 0. 8 deltas and the reason we allow it. to go< go all the way to 0.

8 deltas is before go all the way to 0. 8 deltas is before we< we decide to actually do something about we. decide to actually do something about it< it is because at around 0.

8 deltas that it is because at around 0. 8 deltas that is< is where most of the extrinsic value has is where most of the extrinsic value has gone< gone right and gone right and what< what we're trying to do with cover calls what we're trying to do with cover calls is< is basically just try to is basically just. try to get< get all the credit we can get get all get all the credit we can get get all the< the extrinsic value that we can get the extrinsic value that we can get right< right so if the cover call right so if the cover call has< has become a 0.

8 it's already pretty has become a 0. 8 it's already pretty deep< deep in the money at that point of time deep in the money at that point of time there's< there's not much there's not much extrinsic< extrinsic value left so there are two extrinsic value left so there are two options< options that you can do number one options that you can do number one you< you can roll up and out for credit or you can roll up and. out for credit or for< for break even for break even but< but if you can't then you have no choice but if you can't then you have no choice but< but to leave it and have your stock call but to leave it and have your stock call away away away so< so this is the only so this is the only difference< difference because difference because some< some people might want to use 0.

8 some people might want to use 0. 8 because< because there is a chance that the stock because there is a chance that the stock could< could drop could drop back< back down let's say for example the. back down let's say for example the stock< stock has climbed up stock has climbed up way< way past your strike price to roughly way past your strike price to roughly 0.

#### Topic 2

7< 0. 7 0.

75 0. 7 0.

75 and< and then and then the< the stock starts to make a u-turn back the stock starts to make a u-turn back down down down so< so it could go back down and become out so it could go back down and become out of< of the money again and you didn't have of the money again and you didn't have to< to roll and. you and somehow it could to roll and you and somehow it could actually< actually expire out of the money and if actually expire out of the money and if you< you expire all the money you could you expire all the money you could collect< collect the full credit but had you collect the full credit but had you wrote< wrote when it became 0. 5 then what you wrote when it became 0.

5 then what you have< have done is that you have extended the have done is that you have extended the time< time just to collect that same credit or time just to collect that same credit or slightly< slightly more credit than that slightly more credit than that right< right so your you would be getting less right so your you would be getting less dollar< dollar per day if you were to do that dollar per day if you were to do that and< and what if the stock just keeps you and what if the stock just keeps you know< know keeps rallying at the point of time know keeps rallying at the point of time you< you could be just rolling up and out up you could be just rolling up. and out up and< and out all the way until your days to and out all the way until your days to expiration< expiration on the option could be 100 expiration on the option could be 100 days< days or 200 even 200 days away days or 200 even 200 days away right< right so right so there< there is a give and take so it comes there is a give and take so it comes down< down to your personal preference but in down to your personal preference but in general< general if you don't mind having your general if you don't mind having your stock< stock call away then it is okay for you stock call away then it is okay for you to< to let the covered call reach to a 0. 8 to let the covered call reach to a 0.

8 delta delta delta now now now so< so this is so this is how< how i would manage on my platforms as how i would manage on my platforms as you< you can see i have quite a number of you can see i have quite a number of positions< positions and these are all the cover positions and these are all the cover call< call positions i have so what i do each call positions i have so what i do each day< day is i will just log into the platform day is i will just log into the platform and< and i'll just take a look at the delta i and i'll just take a look at the delta i will< will arrange it in a descending order so will arrange it in a descending order so i< i will know i will know which which which options< options which covered call i have to options which covered call i have to take< take notice first and possibly take notice first and possibly do< do some actions on it so the first thing do some actions on it so the first thing i'll< i'll do is i'll take a look at all the i'll do is i'll take a look at all the deltas< deltas the that is above 50 and above so deltas the that is above 50 and above so at< at this point of time i'll ask myself at this point of time i'll ask myself hey< hey is this a stock that i want to keep hey is this a stock that i want to keep or< or is this a stock that i don't mind or is this a stock that i don't mind having< having it caught away so if this is a having it caught away so if this is a stock< stock that i don't mind have. it caught stock that i don't mind have it caught away< away then i do nothing i just let it away then i do nothing i just let it wait wait wait it< it could probably just expire out of the it could probably just expire out of the money< money at expiration date you know the money at expiration date you know the stock< stock could come back down stock could come back down or< or it can continue to go up and then or it can continue to go up and then when< when he reaches delta 80 then i will when he reaches delta 80 then i will roll< roll but if at this point i would say roll but if at this point i would say that< that oh maybe baba that oh maybe baba i< i want to keep this stock you know i i want to keep this stock you know i don't< don't want it to call away so at this don't want it to call away so at this point< point of time this is where i would look point of time this is where i would look to< to start to roll out and roll up to start to roll out and roll up so< so once i've done uh this three stocks so once i've done uh this three stocks down< down here down here i< i will move on to the other cover calls i will move on to the other cover calls that< that is out of the money right below 50 that is out of the money right below 50 deltas< deltas then i will take a look at them deltas then i will take a look at them and< and generally i do not do anything that and generally i do not do anything that is< is near the 50 even all the way to 20. is near the 50 even all the way to 20.

if< if i see a a covered call that has a if i see a a covered call that has a delta< delta of delta of let's< let's say let's say 10< 10 and below then i will log i would 10 and below then i will log i would just< just open up the just open up the the< the cover call position take a look at the cover call position take a look at extrinsic< extrinsic value and see is there any extrinsic value and see is there any extrinsic< extrinsic value left if there's not much extrinsic value left if there's not much extrinsic< extrinsic value left and there's still extrinsic value left and there's still quite< quite a number of days left to quite a number of days left to expiration< expiration then it doesn't make sense expiration then it doesn't make sense for< for me to for me to just< just leave it there i would rather just just leave it there i would rather just close< close it and then open up a new uh close it and then open up a new uh covered< covered call on other positions or wait covered call on other positions or wait for< for the stock to go up again before sell for the stock to go up again before sell another< another covered car another covered car so< so as you can see so as you can see this< this is a very simple way for you to this is a very simple way for you to manage< manage your covered calls and just at a manage your covered calls and just. at a glance< glance you know if you are busy you are glance you know if you are busy you are outside< outside at work outside at work and< and you have no time to look at the and you have no time to look at the charts< charts you can just pull up your charts you can just pull up your brokerage< brokerage software take a look at the brokerage software take a look at the delta< delta and then decide okay this is what delta and then decide okay this is what i< i need to do this is where i need to i need to do this is where i need to roll< roll or there's nothing for me to do so roll or there's nothing for me to do so a< a very simple uh way method a very simple uh way method very< very systematic as well for you to very systematic as well for you to roll< roll your covered calls roll your covered calls all< all right guys that's it for this video all right guys that's it for this video i< i hope you found this video very useful i hope you found this video very useful if< if you liked it please give me a thumbs if you liked it please give me a thumbs up< up and please subscribe as well if you up and please subscribe as well if you like< like to see more videos like this from like to see more videos like this from me< me alright i'll see you in the next me alright i'll see you in the next video

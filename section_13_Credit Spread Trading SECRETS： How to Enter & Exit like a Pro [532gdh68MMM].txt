Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to show you the entries and I'm going to show you the entries and exits< exits for credit spreads I'm going to exits for credit spreads I'm going to show< show you exactly how to enter into a show you exactly how to enter into a credit< credit spread and also when to exit credit spread and also when to exit right< right so basically what we want to see right so basically what we want to see on< on the chart before we get into a credit on the chart before we get into a credit spread< spread so for this I'm going to be using spread so for this I'm going to be using the< the think of swim web platform so as you the think of swim web platform so as you can< can see down here it says think of swim can see down here it says think of swim web< web so through this think of s web web so through this think of s web platform< platform we're going to start to platform we're going to start to construct< construct our uh credit spreads at the construct our uh credit spreads at the same< same time we're also going to look at a same time we're also going to look at a few< few charts to take a look to see you few charts to take a look to see you know< know which are the ones that you know know which are the ones that you know has< has an opportunity for us to put on a has an opportunity for us to put on a credit< credit spread so first off you need to credit spread so first off you need to have< have like a watch list right a watch have like a watch list right a watch list< list of a number of stocks now how many list of a number of stocks now how many stocks< stocks you want that's totally up to you stocks you want that's totally up to you and< and what kind of stocks that you want to and what kind of stocks that you want to go< go for up to you again all right I have go for up to you again all right I have already< already created you know a number of already created you know a number of videos< videos to share you know what I'm videos to share you know what I'm looking< looking for when it terms of uh stock looking for when it terms of uh stock selection< selection for trading options and selection for trading options and generally< generally uh when I'm trading credit generally uh when I'm trading credit spreads< spreads especially for the bput spread I spreads especially for the bput spread I like< like to find stocks that are like to find stocks that are fundamentally< fundamentally strong right so uh you can fundamentally strong right so uh you can go< go through to some of my other videos on go through to some of my other videos on my< my channel where I talk about it already my channel where I talk about it already so< so for this video right so the very so for this video right so the very first< first thing we want to go through is to first thing we want to go through is to the< the charts right so you want to go to the charts right so you want to go to the< the charts and of course you want to the charts and of course you want to cycle< cycle through all the different you know cycle through all the different you know stocks< stocks that you have in your watch list stocks that you have in your watch list so< so for this example uh is on Tesla right so for this example uh is on Tesla right so< so as you can see down here Tesla on the so as you can see down here Tesla on the right< right hand side uh the stock has right hand side uh the stock has actually< actually been selling off quite a bit actually been selling off quite a bit over< over the couple of last few weeks so as over the couple of last few weeks so as you< you can see the market has been selling you can see the market has been selling off< off down here now uh the thing that I off down here now uh the thing that I want< want to look out for when it comes to want to look out for when it comes to trading< trading credit spreads uh whether I want trading credit spreads uh whether I want to< to put on the bull put spread of or the to put on the bull put spread of or the bare< bare call spread for individual stocks bare call spread for individual stocks well< well one thing that you know you can. use well one thing that you know you can use would< would be the stochastics right so for would be the stochastics right so for this< this is the slow stastics now you can this is the slow stastics now you can use< use the RSI if you want to as well so use the RSI if you want to as well so basically< basically what the sto STC does is that basically what the sto STC does is that it< it tracks whether the market is in an it tracks whether the market is in an overbought< overbought or oversold situation right overbought or oversold situation right so< so naturally if we want to get into a so naturally if we want to get into a bull< bull put spread we definitely want to bull put spread we definitely want to find< find you know a stock where you know at find you know a stock where you know at least< least it is oversold right so if it's least it is oversold right so if it's oversold< oversold then there is a you know a oversold then there is a you know a higher< higher probability that the market can higher probability that the market can go< go up rather than it come down right go up rather than it come down right because< because you know imagine the market because you know imagine the market keeps< keeps going up and then you want to put keeps going up and then you want to put on< on a bull spread right that doesn't on a bull spread right that doesn't sound< sound too strategic right so as much as sound too strategic right so as much as possible< possible we want to put all the odds in possible we want to put all the odds in our< our favor so the first thing that I will our favor so the first thing that I will look< look at down here would be the look at down here would be the stochastics< stochastics so the stochastics as you stochastics so the stochastics as you can< can see it's already oversold right so can see it's already oversold right so if< if it's oversold now the next thing we if it's oversold now the next thing we want< want to take a look at is possible areas want to take a look at is possible areas that< that we can actually sell our bull put that we can actually sell our bull put spread< spread right so in this case it's spread right so in this case it's oversold< oversold we want to go for the bullish oversold we want to go for the bullish credit< credit spread which is the put credit credit spread which is the put credit spread< spread also known as the buut spread so spread also known as the buut spread so first< first thing is I want to try and look first thing is I want to try and look for< for you know support areas so as you can for you know support areas so as you can see< see down here there are you know see down here there are you know previously< previously two lows so to speak where previously two lows so to speak where you< you know prices have bounced off right you know prices have bounced off right one< one is down here and the other one is one is down here and the other one is the< the one right at the bottom so what I'm the one right at the bottom so what I'm going< going to do is I'm going to draw a line going to do is I'm going to draw a line across< across right so I'm going to go to the across right so I'm going to go to the drawing< drawing tools down here click on trend drawing tools down here click on trend line< line then I'm going to click on this line then I'm going to click on this down< down here and then just draw a line down here and then just draw a line across< across so this way will give me you know across so this way will give me you know an< an idea let me know you know where was an idea let me know you know where was the< the last support place right so as you the last support place right so as you can< can see the last support place was can see the last support place was somewhere< somewhere around 205 and then the one at somewhere around 205 and then the one at the< the bottom we want to draw another trend the bottom we want to draw another trend line< line as well so I'm going to draw this line as well so I'm going to draw this trend< trend line as well I'm going to stretch trend line as well I'm going to stretch it< it across so for this trend line it is it across so for this trend line it is somewhere< somewhere around somewhere around 13. 25< 13.

25 somewhere around here right so 13. 25 somewhere around here right so right< right now we have two support areas so right now we have two support areas so ideally< ideally what we want is to have our buo ideally what we want is to have our buo put< put spread below this uh support lines put spread below this uh support lines right< right so where is it going to be is it right so where is it going to be is it going< going to be below this first one or going to be below this first one or below< below the second one now this really below the second one now this really depends< depends also on you know the option depends also on you know the option chain< chain right what kind of uh uh credit chain right what kind of uh uh credit I'm< I'm able to get when I put on the buut I'm able to get when I put on the buut spread< spread but generally you know I like to spread but generally you know I like to put< put the one that is right at the bottom put the one that is right at the bottom right< right I would suggest the one right at right I would suggest the one right at the< the bottom because this seems to hold the bottom because this seems to hold generally< generally this seems to be more of a generally this seems to be more of a stronger< stronger support than this one right at stronger support than this one right at least< least because it seems like you know the least because it seems like you know the market< market has just gone straight through market has just gone straight through down< down here whereas this is where the last down here whereas this is where the last real< real bounce off is so from here the next real bounce off is so from here the next thing< thing I will do is that I will go over thing I will do is that I will go over to< to the trade tab down here so you can to the trade tab down here so you can see< see the trade tab so the trade tab I see the trade tab so the trade tab I want< want to do is I want to pull out the want to do is I want to pull out the option< option chain right so as you can see option chain right so as you can see down< down here the option chain there are down here the option chain there are quite< quite a number of DTE now I've gone quite a number of DTE now I've gone through< through also you know why I chose through also you know why I chose certain< certain DTE but some people you know certain DTE but some people you know they< they like to go for the uh shorter term they like to go for the uh shorter term DTE< DTE well generally I like to go for DTE well generally I like to go for somewhere< somewhere around 45 DTE right so as you somewhere around 45 DTE right so as you can< can see see down here uh there's the 43 can see see down here uh there's the 43 and< and the 57 so I think both of them are and the 57 so I think both of them are pretty< pretty fine pretty okay now you can see pretty fine pretty okay now you can see the< the next thing I want to look at is the next thing I want to look at is pretty< pretty much the volatility right I want pretty much the volatility right I want to< to make sure that this IV down here on to make sure that this IV down here on the< the right hand side is pretty similar the right hand side is pretty similar with< with each other especially you know with each other especially you know sometimes< sometimes when they exchange they sometimes when they exchange they release< release new weekly options right now as release new weekly options right now as you< you can see down here this most likely you can see down here this most likely is< is not newly released and how do I know is not newly released and how do I know that< that is because generally when they that is because generally when they newly< newly release one of those uh options newly release one of those uh options right< right for the new DTE the volatility the right for the new DTE the volatility the IV< IV down here generally will tend to be IV down here generally will tend to be lesser< lesser than the one surrounding it right lesser than the one surrounding it right so< so let's say for example the one above so let's say for example the one above and< and below this weekly one down here is and below this weekly one down here is at< at around 50% right 5050 51% so at around 50% right 5050 51% so sometimes< sometimes when the newly released one sometimes when the newly released one just< just comes out this could be around 40 just comes out this could be around 40 something< something per right maybe 45% 46% then something per right maybe 45% 46% then in< in that case I might just want to avoid in that case I might just want to avoid it< it because you don't want to Short it because you don't want to Short Change< Change yourself right if you're going to Change yourself right if you're going to have< have you know lower IV it means your have you know lower IV it means your premium< premium is not going to going to be you premium is not going to going to be you know< know that high compared to what it know that high compared to what it should< should be and also your Deltas are going should be and also. your Deltas are going to< to be closer to where the current market to be closer to where the current market price< price is that means to say if you're price is that means to say if you're going< going to play something at 30 Delta it's going to play something at 30 Delta it's going< going to be nearer to where the market going to be nearer to where the market is< is so is generally it kind of slightly is so is generally it kind of slightly increases< increases the risk by a little so that increases the risk by a little so that is< is why you know I want to take a look at is why you know I want to take a look at IV< IV first in this case now as for what is IV first in this case now as for what is the< the IV range I'm looking for I generally the IV range I'm looking for I generally do< do not have a preference right as long do not have a preference right as long it's< it's not few 100% right because if you it's not few 100% right because if you go< go for stocks like AMC uh game stop go for stocks like AMC uh game stop those< those kind of uh stocks where they give those kind of uh stocks where they give you< you know a few 100% i' be very wary of you know a few 100% i' be very wary of that< that because it also means that you know that because it also means that you know the< the market expects a very very very huge the market expects a very very very huge move< move right so I don't like to see move right so I don't like to see something< something above 100 over per whereas for something above 100 over per whereas for this< this around 50% even 30% right for this around 50% even 30% right for example< example Google will be 20 something per example Google will be 20 something per even< even 30% and I think those are fine as even 30% and I think those are fine as well< well right so for this let's just use well right so for this let's just use the< the March 2 one 43 days as an example the March 2 one 43 days as an example right< right so what we're going to do is we're right so what we're going to do is we're going< going to go to the put side right so going to go to the put side right so we're< we're going to click this down here we're going to click this down here click< click more until we have all the uh click more until we have all the uh option< option change uh sorry the option option change uh sorry the option strikes< strikes that comes out that you know strikes that comes out that you know that< that we might want to choose so the that we might want to choose so the first< first thing that we want to look out for first thing that we want to look out for is< is at the Delta down here right so as is at the Delta down here right so as you< you can see down here this Delta column you can see down here this Delta column this< this is where we will decide what our this is where we will decide what our short< short strike is right so the very first short strike is right so the very first thing< thing we want to choose is based on our thing we want to choose is based on our short< short strike so how do you want to short strike so how do you want to decide< decide what is the short strike so there decide what is the short strike so there is< is no hard and fast rule as to what is is no hard and fast rule as to what is the< the Delta that you definitely want to the Delta that you definitely want to but< but it also really depends you know how but it also really depends you know how bullish< bullish you are on the underline right bullish you are on the underline right so< so let's say for example if you very so let's say for example if you very very< very bullish then you want to go for very bullish then you want to go for slightly< slightly higher Delta right maybe even slightly higher Delta right maybe even 35< 35 or even 40 Deltas right so let's say 35 or even 40 Deltas right so let's say for< for example you go for the 40 Delta so for example you go for the 40 Delta so what< what you want to do is you click on this what you want to do is you click on this and< and then you click on the 205 so let's and then you click on the 205 so let's say< say for example your risk is somewhere say for example your risk is somewhere around< around you know $500 thereabouts right around you know $500 thereabouts right so< so in this case uh if we have a five so in this case uh if we have a five point< point WID spread that means our risk is point WID spread that means our risk is roughly< roughly around maybe roughly around maybe $300< $300 in this case because the max race $300 in this case because the max race is< is simply the width of the spread right is simply the width of the spread right minus< minus of the credit that you receive so minus of the credit that you receive so as< as you can see in this case the width of as you can see in this case the width of this< this spread is Five Points we minus off this spread is Five Points we minus off the< the credit which is around 1.

95 now if the credit which is around 1. 95 now if you< you want to clarify and double check you want to clarify and double check what< what exactly is the risk all you have to what exactly is the risk all you have to do< do is just click this review down here do is just click this review down here right< right so as you can see down here review right so as you can see down here review it< it says 300 $16 right so if you have it says 300 $16 right so if you have slightly< slightly more risk. right that you want slightly more risk right that you want to< to allocate to the trade then you can to allocate to the trade then you can increase< increase this right maybe you can go to increase this right maybe you can go to 200< 200 so now this is 10p point white uh 200 so now this is 10p point white uh put< put credit spread so you can see down put credit spread so you can see down here< here the credit you receive is about here the credit you receive is about $3.

65< $3. 65 which is about 365 right less the $3.

65 which is about 365 right less the uh< uh uh commissions all right around uh uh commissions all right around $363< $363 or so now you can see the buying $363 or so now you can see the buying power< power effect down here 636 so for defin power effect down here 636 so for defin risk< risk strategies buying power effect or risk strategies buying power effect or in< in this case down here the buying power in this case down here the buying power effect< effect is basically the max loss that effect is basically the max loss that you< you will experience on the trade right you will experience on the trade right so< so this is very different compared to so this is very different compared to undefined< undefined risk strategies like the short undefined risk strategies like the short putut< putut or even the strangle right for putut or even the strangle right for that<. that I will not go into that for this that I will not go into that for this video< video so for this you just need to know video so for this you just need to know that< that your buying power effect is the that your buying power effect is the same< same as your max loss right so as you same as your max loss right so as you can< can see down here we constructed one can see down here we constructed one that's< that's around 41 uh what do you call that's around 41 uh what do you call that< that 41 Delta now if you have this 41 that 41 Delta now if you have this 41 Delta< Delta yes you're going to have you know Delta yes you're going to have you know quite< quite a bit of a credit as you can see quite a bit of a credit as you can see $3. 65< $3.

65 for for the credit is pretty good $3. 65 for for the credit is pretty good but< but the thing is that you're going to but the thing is that you're going to give< give up in terms of your win rate right give up in terms of your win rate right so< so your win rate is going to be slightly so your win rate is going to be slightly lesser< lesser right so how do you tell what's lesser right so how do you tell what's the< the win rate so win rate generally you the win rate so win rate generally you can< can use the Delta as an indication right can use the Delta as an indication right so< so if the Delta is around 40 then it so if the Delta is around 40 then it just< just means that you know you take 100% just means that you know you take 100% minus< minus 41% right so 41 is just an minus 41% right so 41 is just an indication< indication of 41 Delta is the indication indication of 41 Delta is the indication that< that you know it will be there will be a that you know it will be there will be a 41%< 41% chance that this strike will will be 41% chance that this strike will will be in< in the money at expiration right so this in the money at expiration right so this is< is just a very rough calculation right is just a very rough calculation right so< so you take 100 minus around 41 what you so you take 100 minus around 41 what you get< get is around a 60% win rate right get is around a 60% win rate right around< around 59% so you get 59% win rate which around 59% so you get 59% win rate which is< is not that high now if you want to get is not that high now if you want to get a< a higher win rate then what you want to a higher win rate then what you want to do< do is you want to go for slightly lower do is you want to go for slightly lower Delta< Delta right so maybe you might want to Delta right so maybe you might want to go< go for a 30 Delta so if you go for a 30 go for a 30 Delta so if you go for a 30 Delta< Delta and let's go for 10o WID spread Delta and let's go for 10o WID spread right< right so let's say for example for this right so let's say for example for this this< this 10o wide spread that you have down this 10o wide spread that you have down here< here your credit you notice is here your credit you notice is $257< $257 so this is about you know about a $257 so this is about you know about a dollar< dollar or so lesser than the one at the dollar or so lesser than the one at the 41< 41 Delta so this is the trade-off right 41 Delta so this is the trade-off right as< as you can see right if you want to have as you can see right if you want to have a< a higher win rate. you go for a lower a higher win rate you go for a lower Delta< Delta for your short putut but at the Delta for your short putut but at the same< same time if you have a lower Delta you same time if you have a lower Delta you have< have a higher win rate you will have to have a higher win rate you will have to settle< settle for lesser premiums right so this settle for lesser premiums right so this is< is the trade-off now on the other end is the trade-off now on the other end the< the Very extreme one where you want very the Very extreme one where you want very very< very High win rate right let's say for very High win rate right let's say for example< example you want 90% win rate if you example you want 90% win rate if you want< want to go for something like a 90% win want to go for something like a 90% win rate< rate then you're looking at somewhere rate then you're looking at somewhere around< around here right around 119 Deltas or around here right around 119 Deltas or even< even lesser right if you want to go even even lesser right if you want to go even higher< higher in terms of your win rate but higher in terms of your win rate but there< there is one problem down here is that there is one problem down here is that your< your win rate although it's going to be your win rate although it's going to be very< very high the credit that you're going very high the credit that you're going to< to receive is you know it's going to be to receive is you know it's going to be very< very little right so as you can see down very little right so as you can see down here< here let's go for the 10p point WID here let's go for the 10p point WID spread< spread again so 175 165 now you only spread again so 175 165 now you only only< only have 85 cents in terms of your only have 85 cents in terms of your credit< credit right the premium that you credit right the premium that you receive< receive is about $85 by the way if you receive is about $85 by the way if you like< like this video so far Please Subscribe like this video so far Please Subscribe and< and also click the thumbs up button and and also click the thumbs

com blueprint all options with davis. com blueprint all right< right back to the video but your risk right back to the video but your risk down< down here is pretty high high right you down here is pretty high high right you can< can see down here your risk is about can see down here your risk is about $916< $916 so what you have effectively done $916 so what you have effectively done is< is that you have increased the win rate is that you have increased the win rate but< but you have also you know change your but you have also you know change your risk< risk to reward ratio that you know in risk to reward ratio that you know in order< order for you to let's say for example order for you to let's say for example you< you have one Max loser right now you have one Max loser right now generally< generally if you manage it at around 21 generally if you manage it at around 21 DTE< DTE right like what I always mention in DTE right like what I always mention in a< a lot of my videos If you manage it a lot of my videos If you manage it around< around 21 DTE days to expiration then around 21 DTE days to expiration then the< the chances of you actually realizing the chances of you actually realizing this< this Max loss is not very high right this Max loss is not very high right only< only if the market really you know goes only if the market really you know goes all< all the way down way past this uh even all the way down way past this uh even this< this long put strike that you're down this long put strike that you're down here< here 165 if goes way below that then of here 165 if goes way below that then of course< course yeah there's there's a course yeah there's there's a possibility< possibility that you're going to lose possibility that you're going to lose you< you know the max loss but other than you know the max loss but other than that< that at 21 DTE there's still going to be that at 21 DTE there's still going to be quite< quite a bit of extrinsic value left so quite a bit of extrinsic value left so you< you generally won't lose all of this but you generally won't lose all of this but one< one thing to take note down here is that one thing to take note down here is that although< although you have a very high R rate although you have a very high R rate roughly< roughly about what 90% because this is roughly about what 90% because this is around< around 11 Delta but your win rate or around 11 Delta but your win rate or rather< rather your risk reward ratio is about 1 rather your risk reward ratio is about 1 is< is to 10 right you make about $83 and is to 10 right you make about $83 and you< you lose about $916 given that hey uh if you lose about $916 given that hey uh if you< you do lose the max loss so this is one you do lose the max loss so this is one thing< thing that you want to take note of do thing that you want to take note of do you< you want to always keep winning but you want to always keep winning but occasionally< occasionally you have one of those you occasionally you have one of those you know< know pretty big losers or do you want to know pretty big losers or do. you want to have< have on the other end the opposite end have on the other end the opposite end you< you know very very high credit right and you know very very high credit right and your< your risk to re ratio is actually not so your risk to re ratio is actually not so bad< bad right if you take a look at this bad right if you take a look at this your< your risk ratio is about 1 is to two your risk ratio is about 1 is to two right< right uh you're risking about 600 plus right uh you're risking about 600 plus to< to make about 300 plus so your risk is to make about 300 plus so your risk is two< two to make one and your win rate around two to make one and your win rate around here< here would be somewhere around uh about here would be somewhere around uh about 60%< 60% right because it's about 40 Deltas 60% right because it's about 40 Deltas all< all right so this is basically how you all right so this is basically how you decide< decide you know where you want to place decide you know where you want to place your< your put credit spread so generally if your put credit spread so generally if you< you want something you know that is well you want something you know that is well balanced< balanced then I would suggest somewhere balanced then I would suggest somewhere around< around 30 dels right 30 35 dels that around 30 dels right 30 35 dels that would< would be pretty decent right so would be pretty decent right so somewhere< somewhere around here now the other somewhere around here now the other thing< thing that actually influences us where thing that actually influences us where we're< we're going to choose our strikes also we're going to choose our strikes also is< is very dependent on you know where our is very dependent on you know where our support< support area is right so as you can see support area is right so as you can see down< down here the support down here is down here the support down here is around< around 205 so if we construct the 2 191 around 205 so if we construct the 2 191 so< so as you can see down here they already so as you can see down here they already put< put it on the chart for us to see we can put it on the chart for us to see we can see< see immediately that we have already see immediately that we have already placed< placed the put credit spread you know placed the put credit spread you know below< below this one down here right below below this one down here right below this< this 205 support area so you know if the this 205 support area so you know if the market< market comes down here and then it market comes down here and then it bounces< bounces back up then that's good right bounces back up then that's good right we< we have profited on this uh put credit we have profited on this uh put credit spread< spread but if you want to be more spread but if you want to be more conservative< conservative and you want to play it conservative and you want to play it safer< safer and you want to place it below safer and you want to place it below this< this bottom one then you want to look this bottom one then you want to look for< for a strike below for a strike below 13.

25< 13. 25 right so in this case we have to 13.

25 right so in this case we have to adjust< adjust it again so we have to go back to adjust it again so we have to go back to our< our trade tab so let's go to our trade our trade tab so let's go to our trade tab< tab open up the option chain again and tab open up the option chain again and then< then let us go to the one that we were then let us go to the one that we were choosing< choosing I believe it was the March I choosing I believe it was the March I 2nd< 2nd right so as you can see down here so 2nd right so as you can see down here so it< it was below 1 193 right so below 193 we it was below 1 193 right so below. 193 we only< only have one that is uh uh closest is 1 only have one that is uh uh closest is 1 190< 190 right so let's try this so at 1 190 190 right so let's try this so at 1 190 you< you notice that it's at 21 Deltas so 21 you notice that it's at 21 Deltas so 21 Deltas< Deltas just mean that we have about an Deltas just mean that we have about an 80%< 80% win rate all right 80% win rate 80% win rate all right 80% win rate let's< let's do the 10o wide strike and see you let's do the 10o wide strike and see you know< know what is the credit that we receive know what is the credit that we receive so< so we can receive about so we can receive about. 73<.

#### Topic 1

73 and let's take a look at our you. 73 and let's take a look at our you know< know sort of the max risk reward ratio know sort of the max risk reward ratio by< by the way guys this is only the max by the way guys this is only the max risk< risk to the max reward right many times risk to the max reward right many times you< you may not necessarily get the max risk you may not necessarily get the max risk like< like I mentioned because you're going to like I mentioned because you're going to exit< exit early but also you may not also exit early but also you may not also necessarily< necessarily get the max credit if you do necessarily get the max credit if you do not< not want to hold all the way to not want to hold all the way to expiration< expiration so if you're planning to expiration so if you're planning to calculate< calculate you know like the expectancy calculate you know like the expectancy what< what a lot of people like to calculate what a lot of people like to calculate based< based on you know the average win rate based on you know the average win rate times< times the average uh win minus of the times the average uh win minus of the average< average loss rate times the average loss average loss rate times the average loss that< that you incur that's the expectancy that you incur that's the expectancy that< that they will give you but you cannot that they will give you but you cannot use< use that on this uh actual uh use that on this uh actual uh probability< probability which they give you down probability which they give you down here< here because not all the time you're here because not all the time you're going< going to get a Max loss not all the time going to get a Max loss not all the time you're< you're going to get a Max winner right you're going to get a Max winner right there'll< there'll be times where that's in there'll be times where that's in between< between and if you were to get it out between and if you were to get it out earlier< earlier right let's say around 21 tte earlier right let's say around 21 tte you< you have a different result again so you have a different result again so again< again you cannot calculate the again you cannot calculate the expectancy< expectancy just based off of whatever is expectancy just based off of whatever is given< given to you by default right so you given to you by default right so you have< have to actually use the results based have to actually use the results based on< on your trading your trading results to on your trading your trading results to actually< actually calculate that now getting back actually calculate that now getting back to< to our put credit spread down here you to our put credit spread down here you can< can see down here it's 190 to 180 and can see down here it's 190 to 180 and it's< it's about 80% win rate based on this 21 it's about 80% win rate based on this 21 and< and then you can see right you make 171 and then you can see right you make 171 in< in terms of the max profit and then in terms of the max profit and then buying< buying power is 8 to8 so it's actually buying power is 8 to8 so it's actually not< not too bad if you want to go with this not too bad if you want to go with this if< if you are actually okay with this then if you are actually okay with this then what< what you want to do is just go ahead and what you want to do is just go ahead and send< send this uh put credit spread trade in send this uh put credit spread trade in now< now let's say for example you don't now let's say for example you don't really< really like that it's so far away right really like that it's so far away right although< although you have a very high wind rate although you have a very high wind rate you're< you're not very satisfied with this kind you're not very satisfied with this kind of< of uh what do you call the risk reot of uh what do you call the risk reot ratio< ratio so instead what you want to do is ratio so instead what you want to do is you< you want to First wait for the price let you want to First wait for the price let me< me just go back to the Chart again so me just go back to the Chart again so what< what you want to do is that you want to what you want to do is that you want to go< go back to the chart and then you want go back to the chart and then you want to< to see that this price down here to see that this price down here actually< actually trades a little bit lower first actually trades a little bit lower first right< right if it trades a little bit lower right if it trades a little bit lower then< then in this case we are able to get a a then in this case we are able to get a a put< put credit spread with a higher credit put credit spread with a higher credit better< better risk ratio below down here right better risk ratio below down here right so< so let me try and adjust the chart down so let me try and adjust the chart down here< here let me just close this off and see here let me just close this off and see whether< whether we actually get it all right whether we actually get it all right there< there you go so down here you can see there you go so down here you can see that< that this is already below where our that this is already below where our support< support line is which is actually good support line is. which is actually good right< right but at the moment if you're not right but at the moment if you're not satisfied< satisfied with the credit wait for this satisfied with the credit wait for this to< to go a little bit lower then you enter to go a little bit lower then you enter into< into the credit spread because at this into the credit spread because at this point< point of time if you enter into the point of time if you enter into the credit< credit spread chances are that this 20 credit spread chances are that this 20 Delta< Delta over here let me just reopen up Delta over here let me just reopen up the< the option chain again is this one down the option chain again is this one down here< here so as the market actually starts to here so as the market actually starts to go< go lower this Delta starts to increase go lower this Delta starts to increase as< as well right everything starts to as well right everything starts to increase< increase right that means this one may increase right that means this one may start< start to become in the money or at the start to become in the money or at the money< money so as the market goes lower when money so as the market goes lower when this< this becomes maybe at 30 or 35 Delta this becomes maybe at 30 or 35 Delta then< then you can start to enter into the then you can start to enter into the trade< trade right because we already know trade right because we already know roughly< roughly what is the kind of risk to roughly what is the kind of risk to reward< reward based on the 30 to 35 Delta kind reward based on the 30 to 35 Delta kind of< of a put spread right so if you were to of a put spread right so if you were to reconstruct< reconstruct the 30 to 35 one let's say reconstruct the 30 to 35 one let's say the< the 35 uh Delta short strike we know the 35 uh Delta short strike we know we'll< we'll be getting roughly about $310 we'll be getting roughly about $310 right< right so what we can actually do is that right so what we can actually do is that we< we can wait until this one gets down we can wait until this one gets down near< near somewhere around here whereby this near somewhere around here whereby this becomes< becomes around 35 Delta and then we take becomes around 35 Delta and then we take a< a look at the credit right if the credit a look at the credit right if the credit is< is somewhere around $3 something as well is somewhere around $3 something as well then< then we can enter into a trade right so then we can enter into a trade right so this< this is for the the put credit spread this is for the the put credit spread now< now what about the call Credit spread so now what about the call Credit spread so the< the call Credit spread is simply the the call Credit spread is simply the opposite< opposite so let's go back to the Chart opposite so let's go back to the Chart again< again down here so as you can see for again down here so as you can see for this< this down here what I'm looking for this down here what I'm looking for before< before placing the call Credit spread in before placing the call Credit spread in this< this case is we want the price to this case is we want the price to actually< actually trade up right we want the actually trade up right we want the price< price to go much higher and wait until price to go much higher and wait until the< the stochastics is overbought and then the stochastics is overbought and then we< we want to see at that point of time we want to see at that point of time where< where exactly is the price right maybe where exactly is the price right maybe when< when the price goes up down here maybe when the price goes up down here maybe around< around 260 then this will start to show around 260 then this will start to show an< an overbo signal right then at this time an overbo signal right then at this time this< this is where I'll start to pull out you this is where I'll start to pull out you know< know the trend line to try and find you know the trend line to try and find you know< know where is the resistance area so as know where is the resistance area so as you< you can see there's quite a few right you can see there's quite a few right you< you have a resistance area at 265 you you have a resistance area at 265 you have< have another one down here around 270 have another one down here around 270 and< and another one around 280 right so it and another one around 280 right so it really< really depends on where the market is really depends on where the market is when< when it's an overboard signal right if when it's an overboard signal right if the< the market is all the way at around the market is all the way at around 271< 271 uh and then it shows an overboard 271 uh and then it shows an overboard signal< signal then the one we want to use is signal then the one we want to use is somewhere< somewhere around 280 which is our somewhere around 280 which is our resistance< resistance so again we want to just draw resistance so again we want to just draw that< that out so use the Drone line right that out so use the Drone line right click< click on this one time and then just click on this one time and then just extend< extend it to the other side so for here extend it to the other side so for here we< we can see somewhere around 278.

50 6 we can see somewhere around 278. 50 6 right< right so let's say for example the right so let's say for example the market< market has already gone up the market market has already gone up the market has< has gone up and we see that you know has gone up and we see that you know it's< it's at an overbought area then we want it's at an overbought area then we want to< to go to our option chain again right at to go to our option chain again right at the< the point of time we want to go to the point of time we want to go to option< option chain go to the trade tab same option chain go to the trade tab same thing< thing open up this one and then go to thing open up this one and then go to the< the DTE that you want to choose right so the DTE that you want to choose right so we'll< we'll be looking at the call Credit we'll be looking at the call Credit spread< spread at this point now at this point spread at this point now at this point you< you notice that if you were to choose you notice that if you were to choose the< the one at 280 as our short strike it's the one at 280 as our short strike it's just< just going to be too far away right it's just going to be too far away right it's like< like 7 Delta but in the advance we can like 7 Delta but in the advance we can somewhat< somewhat already know roughly what kind somewhat already know roughly what kind of< of credit we will get provided you know of credit we will get provided you know in< in the next few days right because in the next few days right because remember< remember the DTE as it gets lesser and remember the DTE as it gets lesser and lesser< lesser our premium will also shrink as lesser our premium will also shrink as as< as well so you cannot say that you know as well so you cannot say that you know I'm< I'm waiting for it to get to close to I'm waiting for it to get to close to 280< 280 and maybe a week has passed a week 280 and maybe a week has passed a week has< has passed this DTE will now go down to has passed this DTE will now go down to about< about 30 what 36 days so if 36 Days you about 30 what 36 days so if 36 Days you cannot< cannot measure the kind of credit you cannot measure the kind of credit you get< get based on what you get right now get based on what you get right now because< because right now you have about 43 days because right now you have about 43 days so< so at the point of time you may want to so at the point of time you may want to go< go to the next one already right next go to the next one already right next one< one after a week later should be around one after a week later should be around 50< 50 days but just get a general sense of 50 days but just get a general sense of what< what kind of credit we can get let's what kind of credit we can get let's just< just take a look at around the 35 to you just take a look at around the 35 to you know< know 30 Delta so in this case we have know 30 Delta so in this case we have the< the 33 Delta one down here so it's the 33 Delta one down here so it's around< around 235 so provided that at the point around 235 so provided that at the point of< of time you know when the market goes up of time you know when the market goes up this< this 280 will be somewhere around 33 this 280 will be somewhere around 33 Delta< Delta we can take a look at roughly what Delta we can take a look at roughly what kind< kind of uh credit we can get on average kind of uh credit we can get on average right< right so maybe it's around $237 $2 right so maybe it's around $237 $2 thereabouts< thereabouts right especially you know if thereabouts right especially you know if the< the days to expiration left becomes the days to expiration left becomes lesser< lesser and lesser now let's talk about lesser and lesser now let's talk about exits< exits. so how do we actually exit our exits so how do we actually exit our trade< trade so generally for me if I want to trade so generally for me if I want to exit< exit a credit spread I generally have a exit a credit spread I generally have a very< very simple rule right it's either at very simple rule right it's either at 50%< 50% take profit or 21 DTE right so I do 50% take profit or 21 DTE right so I do not< not even look at the chart to see what not even look at the chart to see what the< the chart is doing you know just to exit the chart is doing you know just to exit my< my trade but for some people people my trade but for some people people might< might you know use technical analysis so might you know use technical analysis so maybe< maybe for yourself if you were to take a maybe for yourself if you were to take a look< look at the chart and if you see that look at the chart and if you see that let's< let's say for example we we're looking let's say for example we we're looking at< at the put credit spread right in this at the put credit spread right in this case< case let's take a look at put credit case let's take a look at put credit spread< spread so maybe if you see that the spread so maybe if you see that the market< market keeps going up and it's still far market keeps going up and it's still far away< away from this resistance area down here away from this resistance area down here and< and you think that you know the market and you think that you know the market still< still has some room to go and there's still has some room to go and there's not< not many days left to expiration you not many days left to expiration you could< could maybe want to choose to hold all could maybe want to choose to hold all the< the way to expiration right so maybe the way to expiration right so maybe that< that is what you might want to do if you that is what you might want to do if you use< use technical analysis or maybe some use technical analysis or maybe some indicator< indicator right maybe the other way you indicator right maybe the other way you can< can use is using this stochastic or the can use is using this stochastic or the RSI< RSI to see hey if it becomes overbought RSI to see hey if it becomes overbought then< then maybe that's time to get out of then maybe that's time to get out of your< your uh buut spread because right you your uh buut spread because right you don't< don't want to get into a situation don't want to get into a situation whereby< whereby the market starts to come down whereby the market starts to come down again< again and erode your profits okay so again and erode your profits okay so that's< that's how I would tackle exit and as that's how I would tackle exit and as you< you can see guys it's pretty pretty you can see guys it's pretty pretty simple< simple okay guys so I hope you like this simple okay guys so I hope you like this video< video and have an insight as to how you video and have an insight as to how you can< can actually construct the credit spread can actually construct the credit spread on< on your trading platform by the way if on your trading platform by the way if you< you like this video then you absolutely you like this video then you absolutely going< going to love this next video which I going to love this next video which I

=======================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so today we're all right all righty so today we're going< going to learn about how to become a going to learn about how to become a poor< poor man poor man just< just kidding but we are going to talk just kidding but we are going to talk about< about the poor man's cover call so what about the poor man's cover call so what is< is it how does it compare to the normal is it how does it compare to the normal cover< cover call what are the risks and cover call what are the risks and whether< whether you should be using deployments whether you should be using deployments cover< cover call so first of all what is a cover call so first of all what is a poor< poor man's cover call so let's start off poor man's cover call so let's start off with< with what a normal cover call position with what a normal cover call position is< is so a normal cover call position is is so a normal cover call position is just< just simply buying a hundred shares of just simply buying a hundred shares of the< the underlying stock and then selling the underlying stock and then selling your< your covered call which is a short call your covered call which is a short call option< option so what is the poor man's cover option so what is the poor man's cover call< call so the promise cover call instead call so the promise cover call instead of< of buying 100 shares of the underlying of buying 100 shares of the underlying stock< stock we buy a deep in the money call stock we buy a deep in the money call option< option right so this call option can option right so this call option can have< have an expiration have an expiration you< you know anywhere from three months to you know anywhere from three months to six< six months or even longer right i six months or even longer right i personally< personally like to buy a deep in the personally like to buy a deep in the money< money call option on leaps which is a money call option. on leaps which is a year< year or longer right so this way i have year or longer right so this way i have a< a longer time for the trade to work out a longer time for the trade to work out in< in my favor in my favor and< and then we still sell a covered call so and then we still sell a covered call so the< the reason why it's called a poor man's the reason why it's called a poor man's covered< covered call covered call is< is because it is much significantly is because it is much significantly cheaper< cheaper than a cover call position right cheaper than a cover call position right so< so many people when they start trading so many people when they start trading the< the options right they may not have a the options right they may not have a hundred< hundred shares or rather have the hundred shares or rather have the capital< capital to buy a hundred shares of the capital to buy a hundred shares of the underlying< underlying stock so instead they can use underlying stock so instead they can use uh< uh lesser money to buy the deep in money uh lesser money to buy the deep in money call< call option this way you can still have call option this way you can still have a< a very similar position and in fact have a very similar position and in fact have a< a higher return so a higher return so let's< let's take a look at it on the charts let's take a look at it on the charts and< and see how it looks like right so this and see how it looks like right so this is< is the chart of starbucks so let's just is the chart of starbucks so let's just say< say we're going to initiate a say we're going to initiate a cover< cover call position so to get into a cover call position so to get into a covered< covered call position well first of all covered call position well first of all we're< we're going to buy a hundred shares we're going to buy a hundred shares right< right so 100 shares at 83. 59 right so 100 shares at 83.

59 would< would cost us 8 would cost us 8 359 359 359 and< and then let's say we sell a cover call and then let's say we sell a cover call at< at the 88 strike price right with a at the 88 strike price right with a dt< dt of 25 so we could get about a dollar dt of 25 so we could get about a dollar 20< 20 cents for this all right so 20 cents for this all right so a< a dollar 20 cents is 120 because each a dollar 20 cents is 120 because each option< option has a hundred shares so let's option has a hundred shares so let's calculate< calculate the return of this all right calculate the return of this all right so< so the annualized return is just simply so the annualized return is. just simply you< you take the you take the premium< premium which you receive 120 you premium which you receive 120 you divided< divided by the cost of buying the divided by the cost of buying the hundred< hundred shares and you divide it by the hundred shares and you divide it by the number< number of days for the cover call right number of days for the cover call right because< because this cover call will expire in because this cover call will expire in 25< 25 days then this dollar 20 cents will 25 days then this dollar 20 cents will be< be realized profit for us so we divided be realized profit for us so we divided by< by 25 and we times 365 days that gives by 25 and we times 365 days that gives us< us an annualized return of 20. 96 us an annualized return of 20.

96 so< so it is not bad right so this is not uh so it is not bad right so this is not uh considering< considering uh the price movement right considering uh the price movement right we< we haven't considered whether the price we haven't considered whether the price will< will be going down or the price will be will be going down or the price will be going< going up right so this is just merely going up right so this is just merely the< the return of this covered call on the the return of this covered call on the cost< cost of the shares cost of the shares now< now let's compare it with the poor man's now let's compare it with the poor man's cover< cover call so the permanent cover call cover call so the permanent cover call instead< instead of buying the shares we're going instead of buying the shares we're going to< to buy a deep in the money call option to buy a deep in the money call option so< so in this case i've used the call so in this case i've used the call option option option which< which has an expiration date of a 543 which has an expiration date of a 543 days< days left to go. days left to go so< so for this we can get it for 3995 so for this we can get it for 3995 okay< okay so okay so 3995< 3995 you can see is significantly less 3995 you can see is significantly less in< in fact it's less than half the cost of in fact it's less than half the cost of 100< 100 shares so next same thing we would 100 shares so next same thing we would sell< sell a cover call so assuming it's the sell a cover call so assuming it's the same< same cover call same cover call and< and then we receive 120 for it so what and then we receive 120 for it so what is< is the return so the return is the return so the return similarly< similarly we take 120 but this time we similarly we take 120 but this time we divide< divide it by the cost of this long call divide it by the cost of this long call option< option which is only 3995 option which is only 3995 divided< divided by 25 days to expiration and divided by 25 days to expiration and then< then we times 365 days and this gives us then we times 365 days and this gives us a< a return of 43. 85 a return of 43.

85 so< so as you can see so as you can see just< just from the covered call loan we've just from the covered call loan we've already< already doubled right our return right already doubled right our return right we< we have already doubled our return we have already doubled our return on< on the normal covered call position so on the normal covered call position so that< that is why the pullman's cover call is that is why the pullman's cover call is a< a quite a popular option strategy among a quite a popular option strategy among a< a lot of people because you can get a a lot of people because you can get a very< very high return and the risk is kept very high return and the risk is kept right< right your risk is less than half you right your risk is less than half you would< would if you buy a hundred shares would if you buy a hundred shares. okay< okay so what about if the stock was to okay so what about if the stock was to go< go up or the stock was to go down what go up or the stock was to go down what is< is the difference between the profits is the difference between the profits and< and loss between the cover call and the and loss between the cover call and the poor< poor man's cover call so let's head over poor man's cover call so let's head over to< to my trading platform to show you the to my trading platform to show you the difference difference difference so< so as you can see uh let's take a quick so as you can see uh let's take a quick look< look at how starbucks is doing since the look at how starbucks is doing since the screenshot< screenshot i took so when i took the screenshot i took so when i took the screenshot< screenshot starbucks was around 83. 58 screenshot starbucks was around 83.

58 right< right now the market has dropped a right now the market has dropped a little< little bit lower so let's take a look at little bit lower so let's take a look at the< the option chain and see how we can the option chain and see how we can construct< construct both the cover call and the construct both the cover call and the poor< poor man's cover call and compare it to poor man's cover call and compare it to each< each other so the first thing i want to each other so the first thing i want to do< do right we go to the option chain and do right we go to the option chain and then< then we want to take a look at which is then we want to take a look at which is the< the cover call days to expiration when the cover call days to expiration when you< you want to sell it right so let's say i you want to sell it right so let's say i want< want to go at 25 days want to go at 25 days okay okay okay so< so if i want to initiate a cover call so if i want to initiate a cover call positions< positions very simple i'll just. go to positions very simple i'll just go to the< the strike that i want to sell the cover the strike that i want to sell the cover call< call at so let's say in this case call at so let's say in this case let's< let's go for the 88 all right so what i let's go for the 88 all right so what i do< do is i will right click it i'll say do is i will right click it i'll say analyze< analyze by trade because i want to analyze by trade because i want to analyze< analyze the risk profile analyze the risk profile and< and then i click covered stock so you and then i click covered stock so you can< can see if i click covered stock can see if i click covered stock you< you immediately populate this order you immediately populate this order ticket< ticket you have a hundred shares you buy ticket you have a hundred shares you buy a< a hundred shares and then you're selling a hundred shares and then you're selling the< the covered call this call option the covered call this call option and< and the strike of 88 and then it's a and the strike of 88 and then it's a debit< debit for 80. 56 so that's debit for 80.

56 so that's 856< 856 dollars all right so let's take a 856 dollars all right so let's take a look< look at the risk profile so you can see look at the risk profile so you can see this< this is the risk profile at expiration this is the risk profile at expiration right< right expiration date this is how right expiration date this is how uh< uh the expiration of the covered call uh the expiration of the covered call this< this is how the graph will look like so this is how the graph will look like so we< we. have two lines down here so this is we have two lines down here so this is to< to just indicate how much you will make to just indicate how much you will make or< or lose if the market goes down or up so or lose if the market goes down or up so right< right now the current market price is right now the current market price is where< where this uh where this uh if< if you can see this goal lines somewhere if you can see this goal lines somewhere around< around here around here right< right around 80. right around 80.

um< um six around there all right so if the um six around there all right so if the stock< stock was to go to seventy dollars how stock was to go to seventy dollars how much< much does it lose all right this is a much does it lose all right this is a covered< covered call position if it goes to covered call position if it goes to seventy< seventy dollars you can see it loses a seventy dollars you can see it loses a thousand< thousand and fifty six dollars all right thousand and fifty six dollars all right and< and then if it goes up to ninety dollars and then if it goes up to ninety dollars it< it makes seven 744 dollars so let's it makes seven 744 dollars so let's compare< compare this to the poor man's cover compare this to the poor man's cover call< call so for the permanence cover call call so for the permanence cover call same< same thing i'll find the strike which i same thing i'll find the strike which i want< want to sell the cover call at right want to sell the cover call at right analyze< analyze by trade but this time i will analyze by trade but this time i will click< click the diagonal right so this poor click the diagonal right so this poor man's< man's. cover call in essence is actually man's cover call in essence is actually just< just a diagonal spread because you're just a diagonal spread because you're buying< buying and selling two different options buying and selling two different options from< from two different expiration dates now from two different expiration dates now it< it will populate the next available uh it will populate the next available uh option< option calendar date that you can uh option calendar date that you can uh go< go to but in this case we don't want to go to but in this case we don't want to use< use this you want to go slightly further use this you want to go slightly further right right right generally< generally you want to go for somewhere generally you want to go for somewhere around< around 180 days or further i like to go around 180 days or further i like to go all< all the way to the furthest because all the way to the furthest because i< i tend to see this as a longer term uh i tend to see this as a longer term uh investment< investment a longer trade so in this investment a longer trade so in this case< case i will go for the 19th january i'll case i will go for the 19th january i'll just< just adjust to 19 january 24. now the just adjust to 19 january 24.

now the next< next thing you want to do is try next thing you want to do is try and< and see which strike that you want to and see which strike that you want to actually< actually buy all right so again we want actually buy all right so again we want to< to go for the deep in the money ones to go for the deep in the money ones right< right so we're looking for deltas that right so we're looking for deltas that is< is above 80 right the higher normally is above 80 right the higher normally the< the better but you also want to see how the better but you also want to see how much< much you'll be paying for it right much you'll be paying for it right ideally< ideally i like to pay ideally i like to pay at< at most or rather at most or rather yeah< yeah ideally i want to pay at most half yeah ideally i want to pay at most half of< of what the cost of a hundred shares of. what the cost of a hundred shares would< would be so hundred shares at this point would be so hundred shares at this point of< of time will be around eight thousand of time will be around eight thousand hundred< hundred so i like to pay around four hundred so i like to pay around four thousand< thousand dollars for it so around this thousand dollars for it so around this strike< strike 40 or strike 45 would be ideal strike 40 or strike 45 would be ideal for< for me all right so let's say we go for for me all right so let's say we go for the< the 45 strike price so i'll shift this the 45 strike price so i'll shift this to< to 45 to 45 so< so you can see so you can see if< if you were to buy the 45 long call and if you were to buy the 45 long call and you< you sell the 88 strike price for the you sell the 88 strike price for the cover< cover call you only pay 37. 36 so that is cover call you only pay 37.

36 so that is 3 3 3 736 736 736 right< right that is less than half of what right that is less than half of what you're< you're paying for 100 shares for the you're paying for 100 shares for the covered< covered call position covered call position now< now the reason why you want to go in now the reason why you want to go in deep< deep in the money call is because deep in the money call is because of< of this number down here so this is the of this number down here so this is the extrinsic< extrinsic column so extrinsic extrinsic column so extrinsic value< value extrinsic value is very important value extrinsic value is very important if< if you want to if you want to buy< buy and sell options right you need to buy and sell options right you need to understand< understand what is extrinsic value so understand what is extrinsic value so this< this is basically time value and this this is basically time value and this will< will all go down to zero at the end of will all go down to zero at the end of the< the expiration date so as much as the expiration date so as much as possible< possible when you're buying options you possible when you're buying options you want< want to buy as little extrinsic value as want to buy as little extrinsic value as possible< possible so you can see if you go all possible so you can see if you go all the< the way far up you know the way far up you know there< there are some people who are saying there are some people who are saying that< that you know you can go ahead and buy that you know you can go ahead and buy you< you know the long call option at a you know the long call option at a cheaper< cheaper price right you can go out of cheaper price right you can go out of the< the money right you can even go to the money right you can even go to 90< 90 strike price and you only pay nine 90 strike price and you only pay nine dollars< dollars 20 cents all right the mark is dollars 20 cents all right the mark is nine< nine dollars so you only pay 900 nine dollars so you only pay 900 to< to control 100 shares roughly at this to control 100 shares roughly at this price< price 81 dollars right price 81 dollars right but< but the problem is that you are actually but the problem is that you are actually paying< paying mostly extrinsic value extrinsic paying mostly extrinsic value extrinsic value< value at l they will go to zero so just value at l they will go to zero so just to< to give you an idea where the stock has to give you an idea where the stock has to< to go right ninety dollars is a strike to go right ninety. dollars is a strike price< price and if you are paying nine dollars price and if you are paying nine dollars for< for it all right it means the stock has for it all right it means the stock has to< to go up to ninety nine dollars by the to go up to ninety nine dollars by the time time time this< this option expires or you lose this option expires or you lose everything< everything that you paid for everything that you paid for right< right so you can see now it's only right so you can see now it's only eighty< eighty one dollars for if you go to eighty one dollars for if you go to ninety< ninety nine dollars that's almost twenty ninety nine dollars that's almost twenty dollars< dollars so it has to move twenty dollars dollars so it has to move twenty dollars out< out of you know eighty dollars so that's out of you know eighty dollars so that's about< about twenty five percent return right about twenty five percent return right you< you need to move 25 you need to move 25 for< for you to break even and you haven't for you to break even and you haven't made< made money yet so that is why i always made money yet so that is why i always um um um prefer< prefer to buy a dip in the money the prefer to buy a dip in the money the call< call option if i'm buying an option call option if i'm buying an option right< right so you can see the extrinsic value right so you can see the extrinsic value is< is much lesser so this way you actually is much lesser so this way you actually do< do not do not have< have a huge decay and you're paying have a huge decay and you're paying relatively< relatively lesser and don't forget relatively lesser and don't forget you're< you're having the covered quality offset you're having the covered quality offset your< your extrinsic value and ideally i want your extrinsic value and ideally i want to< to sell to sell a< a cover call that can fully offset this a cover call that can fully offset this extrinsic< extrinsic value in either the first extrinsic value in either the first cover< cover call or in the next one to two cover call or in the next one to two covered< covered calls so if you recall covered calls so if you recall the< the cover call that we sold the cover call that we sold all< all right or we are intending to sell all right or we are intending to sell right< right as an example is 88 so this 88 we right as an example is 88 so this 88 we can< can get roughly 72 cents right 72 cents can get roughly 72 cents right 72 cents and< and we have gotten the 45 strikes so 72 and we have gotten the 45 strikes so 72 cents< cents minus of 1. 79 so this roughly left cents minus of 1.

#### Topic 1

79 so this roughly left a< a dollar seven cents left so if i can do a dollar seven cents left so if i can do this< this right another two times it means this right another two times it means i've< i've completely removed the extrinsic i've completely removed the extrinsic value< value risk of this option and even into value risk of this option and even into the< the intrinsic that means if the market the intrinsic that means if the market just< just goes back to where it was when i just goes back to where it was when i first< first entered this position i still make first entered this position i still make money< money because of the covered call money because of the covered call instead< instead of so right so instead of so right so all< all right so the poor man's cover call all right so the poor man's cover call position position position let's< let's take a look at the risk profile let's take a look at the risk profile conf< conf compared to the normal cover call conf compared to the normal cover call position< position so position so again< again first of all let's recall and see again first of all let's recall and see again< again what is the loss here so at again what is the loss here so at seventy< seventy dollars the loss is at a seventy dollars the loss is at a thousand< thousand and fifty six dollars so let's thousand and fifty six dollars so let's take< take a look at the poor man's cover call take a look at the poor man's cover call now< now you see the poor man's cover call now you see the poor man's cover. call loss< loss is lesser right the loss is only loss is lesser right the loss is only 892< 892 but what about the profits all right 892 but what about the profits all right the< the profits is the profits is 744< 744 dollars 744 dollars and< and what about the profits for the poor and what about the profits for the poor man's< man's cover call the promised cover man's cover call the promised cover crowd< crowd profit is lesser so you can see crowd profit is lesser so you can see the< the risk is lesser the loss is lesser the risk is lesser the loss is lesser but< but the profits is also lesser but then but the profits is also lesser but then let's< let's calculate this in terms of return let's calculate this in terms of return right< right because we always want to see in right because we always want to see in terms< terms of percentage wise how does it do terms of percentage wise how does it do so< so let's first start off with the cover so let's first start off with the cover call call call and< and let's bring up our trusty calculator and let's bring up our trusty calculator here< here to take a look at here to take a look at in< in terms of the profit right in terms of the profit right so< so let's say we have a profit of 744 so let's say we have a profit of 744 at< at expiration date of the covered call at expiration date of the covered call it< it went up to 90 dollars right so we it went up to 90 dollars right so we take< so< so the return is 9. 2 all right and let's so the return is 9.

2 all right and let's just< just keep this simple let's not analyze just keep this simple let's not analyze it< it that means we don't divide it by the it that means we don't divide it by the days< days to expiration for the cover call so days to expiration for the cover call so this< this is just simply nine point two this is just simply nine point two percent percent percent on< on this uh profit over the cost of your on this uh profit over the cost of your stock< stock right so nine point two three stock right so nine point two three percent< percent now let's take a look. at the percent now let's take a look at the covered< covered corporate uh the poor man's covered corporate uh the poor man's cover< cover call position cover call position all< all right so the permanent cover call all right so the permanent cover call we< we have a profit of we have a profit of 615< 615 dollars all right let's just run it 615 dollars all right let's just run it down< down 615 dollars we divided by the cost down 615 dollars we divided by the cost 3736< 3736 dollars 3736 dollars so< so you can see we have a return of so you can see we have a return of 16. 46< 16.

46 percent so with the cover call we 16. 46 percent so with the cover call we have< have 9.

2 percent and with the poor man's have 9. 2 percent and with the poor man's cover< cover call we have 16.

46 cover call we have 16. 46 so< so it is a higher return on your capital so it is a higher return on your capital now< now let's take a look at the downside now let's take a look at the downside right< right we also want to always take a look right we also want to always take a look at< at our risk so risk is very important as at our risk so risk is very important as well< well so let's see what's the base in well so let's see what's the base in terms< terms of percentage terms of percentage uh< uh when it comes to. the promise cover uh when it comes to the promise cover call< call so naturally it will be higher call so naturally it will be higher because< because your uh cost is lesser so let's because your uh cost is lesser so let's take< take a look 892 dollars will be divided take a look 892 dollars will be divided by< by the cost again three seven three six by the cost again three seven three six so< so let's say if this the stock goes down so let's say if this the stock goes down to< to 70 dollars right we lose roughly 23.

8 to 70 dollars right we lose roughly 23. 8 right< right so that's quite big right now right so that's quite big right now let's< let's take a look at the cover call let's take a look at the cover call the< all< all right let's see the loss here so all right let's see the loss here so it's< it's a thousand and fifty six dollars it's a thousand and fifty six dollars less< less divided by the cost eight zero five less divided by the cost eight zero five six six six so< so you can see the loss is slightly so you can see the loss is slightly lesser< lesser in terms of percentage-wise so lesser in terms of percentage-wise so here's< here's the takeaway for this that means here's the takeaway for this that means that< that if you want to get into a permanent that if you want to get into a permanent covered< covered call position covered call position you< you also want to take into account that you also want to take into account that there's< there's a possibility that you could there's a possibility that you could lose< lose the money so you're going to lose lose the money so you're going to lose money< money you want to put all your account money you want to put all your account or< or all your or all your money< money which you have the capital into money which you have the capital into just< just one position you want to diversify just one position you want to diversify and< and allocate them according to your risk and allocate them according to your risk all< all right so let's have some takeaways all right so let's have some takeaways for< for the cover call position and the for the cover call position and the permanent< permanent cover call position and you permanent cover call position and you can< can decide for yourself which one is can decide for yourself which one is better< better for you so first of all the cover better for you so first of all the cover call< call position it's much more expensive call position it's much more expensive because< because we're buying a hundred shares because we're buying a hundred shares whereas< whereas the permanent cover call is whereas the permanent cover call is cheaper< cheaper because we are buying a long cheaper because we are buying a long call< call option which is considerably lesser call option which is considerably lesser in< in cost than the 100 shares next the in cost than the 100 shares next the cover< cover call position in terms of dollars cover call position in terms of dollars is< is actually higher in terms of profit is actually higher in terms of profit and< and the permanent cover call is lower in and the permanent cover call is lower in terms< terms of the profit but then the risk is terms of the profit but then the risk is also< also higher for the covered car position also higher for the covered car position right< right because your risk is on 100 shares right because your risk is on 100 shares whereas< whereas for this is on what you paid for whereas for this is on what you paid for the< the call option the call option so< so for the covered call position we have so for the covered call position we have seen< seen that the return is actually lower seen that the return is actually lower again< again simply because you're buying 100 again simply because you're buying 100 shares< shares whereas for the permits cover shares whereas for the permits cover call< call your profits is on a lower cost call your profits is on a lower cost right< right on the long call option right on the long call option and< and the most important thing is that the and the most important thing is that the covered< covered call position actually has no covered call position actually has no expiration< expiration date so for shares you can expiration date so for shares you can hold< hold for as long as you want so if for hold for as long as you want so if for some< some reason when you enter into the some reason when you enter into the position position position right< right the stock goes all the way down right the stock goes all the way down and< and it takes a long time before it and it takes a long time before it finally< finally recovers and goes up right so in finally recovers and goes up right so in a< a covered. call position right you can a covered call position right you can just< just hold on to the shares right there's just hold on to the shares right there's no no no risk< risk or any complications involved risk or any complications involved because< because there's no expiration date but because there's no expiration date but the< the poor main cover call right the poor the poor main cover call right the poor man's< man's cover call has an expiration date man's cover call has an expiration date so< so you need to keep in mind uh about so you need to keep in mind uh about this< this because uh if when there's an this because uh if when there's an expiration< expiration date you ideally want the expiration date you ideally want the trade< trade to work out before the long call trade to work out before the long call expires< expires because if it expires and you're expires because if it expires and you're still< still lost then there's going to be some still lost then there's going to be some complication< complication there because you're not complication there because you're not sure< sure what to do right

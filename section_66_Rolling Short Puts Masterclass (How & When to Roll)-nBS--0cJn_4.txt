===================================================================

Language: en hey< hey davis here and welcome to this hey davis here and welcome to this master< master class on rolling shot puts now if master class on rolling shot puts now if you've< you've ever wondered how and when you've ever wondered how and when exactly< exactly to roll your short put then by exactly to roll your short put then by the< the end of this video you're going to the end of this video you're going to learn< learn everything you need to know about learn everything you need to know about rolling< rolling shot puts so that you can start rolling shot puts so that you can start rolling< rolling your short puts like a pro rolling your short puts like a pro alright< alright so first off we want to know alright so first off we want to know exactly< exactly what does rolling mean and why exactly what does rolling mean and why even< even roll in the first place even roll in the first place so< so rolling basically just means to close so rolling basically just means to close out< out your current option position and out your current option position and then< then simultaneously open another option then simultaneously open another option position< position in one order ticket so in our position in one order ticket so in our case< case because we have a short put case because we have a short put we< we have sold a put option to close it we we have sold a put option to close it we have< have to buy it back so we buy back our have to buy it back so we buy back our current< current short put and then we sell current short put and then we sell another< another put option so we do all this in another put option so we do all this in just< just one ticket so as you can see this just one ticket so as you can see this is< is just the process of rolling it's very is just the process of rolling it's very simple< simple right so in this example you can simple right so in this example you can see< see that we have bought back the option see that we have bought back the option on< on the 12th of august and then we sold on the 12th of august and then we sold another< another one two weeks out another one two weeks out on< on 26 august and for this we keep the on 26 august and for this we keep the same< same strike and then we receive a credit same strike and then we receive a credit for< for. it so it's very simple we basically for it so it's very simple we basically just< just close out the current option just close out the current option position< position open another one and the key is position open another one and the key is to< to get a credit for it to get a credit for it so< so why do we want a row so there are so why do we want a row so there are five< five reasons to roll a short put right five reasons to roll a short put right so< so the first reason is to improve your so the first reason is to improve your probability< probability of profit so let's say for probability of profit so let's say for example< example you have a short put example you have a short put at< at a hundred dollars all right you sold at a hundred dollars all right you sold a< a shop with a hundred dollars then a shop with a hundred dollars then you< you decided to roll after the market you decided to roll after the market decide< decide to drop right if the market drops decide to drop right if the market drops and< and then you want to roll so let's say and then you want to roll so let's say you< you could roll it to you could roll it to 95 95 95 so< so what does this mean so what does this mean so< so previously if you had the short boot so previously if you had the short boot the< the only way you'd be able to sort of the only way you'd be able to sort of capture< capture the full profit on this short capture the full profit on this short board< board is if the market goes above 100 board is if the market goes above 100 and< and it and your put option expires and it and your put option expires worthless< worthless right but now that you have worthless right but now that you have rolled< rolled it down rolled it down the< the market can come down to even 96 the market can come down to even 96 dollars dollars dollars and< and then if it stays there at expiration and then if it stays there at expiration you< you still make the full profit on this you still make the full profit on this premium< premium which you have received for premium which you have received for selling< selling the original 100 and then for selling the original 100 and then for the< the credit uh for after you have rolled the credit uh for after you have rolled it< it down to 95. so now anything above 95 it down to 95.

so now anything above 95 is< is a profit for you is a profit for you so< so that is why we have a higher so that is why we have a higher probability< probability of profit compared to when probability of profit compared to when we< we had the short put at 100 we had the short put at 100 now< now the second reason is to give more now the second reason is to give more time< time for the trade to work out right so time for the trade to work out right so when< when we are rolling we are also when we are rolling we are also extending< extending our time so you can see we extending our time so you can see we have< have extended from the 12th august to 26 have extended from the 12th august to 26 august< august this way you know if you didn't august this way you know if you didn't roll< roll and the market roll and the market went< went below your strike of 112 went below your strike of 112 on< on the expiration date you'll be on the expiration date you'll be assigned< assigned on the shares assigned on the shares but< but if you have extended it you're but if you have extended it you're giving< giving it another two weeks wiggle room giving it another two weeks wiggle room the< the market could just go back up above the market could just go back up above 112< 112 and it expires worthless and then 112 and it expires worthless and then you'll< you'll be able to receive the full you'll be able to receive the full credit< credit so it gives us more time for the credit so it gives us more time for the trade< trade to work out trade to work out now< now the third reason is to reduce the now the third reason is to reduce the chances< chances of getting assigned chances of getting assigned so< so this is one of the biggest worries or so this is one of the biggest worries or concerns< concerns that many people have when they concerns that many people have when they are< are selling options is that they are are selling options is that they are getting< getting assigned so in this case with a getting assigned so in this case with a short< short put when you're assigned on the short put when you're assigned on the short< short port it means that you'll be short port it means that you'll be buying< buying 100 shares of the underlying buying 100 shares of the underlying stock< stock per contract stock per contract so< so when you increase the time length so when you increase the time length from< from 12 to 26 or to however far away the from 12 to 26 or to however far away the expiration< expiration date is you reduce the chance expiration date is you reduce the chance of< of getting a sign because normally of getting a sign because normally people< people wouldn't want to exercise the people wouldn't want to exercise the option< option until it's much closer towards option until it's much closer towards the< the expiration date for example if you the expiration date for example if you bought< bought a put option with about 200 days bought a put option with about 200 days left< left would you want to exercise it right left would you want to exercise it right now< now even though the market is down most now even though the market is down most likely< likely not right chances are that you likely not right chances are that you wait< wait closer towards expiration date to wait closer towards expiration date to see< see whether is it still below your see whether is it still below your strike< strike price before you decided to strike price before you decided to exercise< exercise it so this reduces the chances exercise it so this reduces the chances of< of getting assigned now the fourth of getting assigned now the fourth reason reason reason is< is to. get a better assignment price so is to get a better assignment price so in< in this case in this case most< most likely your the stock has gone way most likely your the stock has gone way below< below your strike price so again let's below your strike price so again let's use< use this example let's say you have use this example let's say you have hundred< hundred let's say the market has dropped hundred let's say the market has dropped all< all the way to maybe i don't know 70 all the way to maybe i don't know 70 dollars< dollars now you'll be surprised dollars now you'll be surprised that< that you actually may not get a sign if that you actually may not get a sign if there's< there's still quite a number of days there's still quite a number of days left< left to the expiration right i have many left to the expiration right i have many options< options uh before where you know it has options uh before where you know it has gone< gone deep in the money but i haven't got gone deep in the money but i haven't got a< a sign on it because the dte is still a sign on it because the dte is still more more more than< than 30 days than 30 days so so so sooner< sooner or later if you let this go sooner or later if you let this go closer< closer towards expiration date then closer towards expiration date then there's< there's a bigger risk of you getting there's a bigger risk of you getting assigned< assigned so assigned so if< if you want to get a better assignment if you want to get a better assignment rate< rate one way is to just write down so rate one way is to just write down so for< for example if you roll it down for example if you roll it down to to to 95 95 95 so< so in the eventuality that you actually so in the eventuality that you actually do< do get assigned you get assigned on 95 do get assigned you get assigned on 95 rather< rather than on 100 dollars so this gives rather than on 100 dollars so this gives you< you a better price on your stock which you a better price on your stock which is< is a five dollars difference right so if is a five dollars difference right so if you< you know you're going to get assigned you know you're going to get assigned anyway anyway anyway you'd< you'd rather get assigned at a lower you'd rather get assigned at a lower price< price than a higher price okay price than a higher price okay now< now the fifth reason is cost basis now the fifth reason is cost basis reduction< reduction and this is uh one of the key reduction and this is uh one of the key reasons< reasons why a lot of people like selling reasons why a lot of people like selling puts< puts because you get all these credits puts because you get all these credits right< right and this credit can really help right and this credit can really help reduce< reduce the cost of the stock the reduce the cost of the stock the underlying< underlying stock if you were to get underlying stock if you were to get assigned< assigned so in this case let's say 112 assigned so in this case let's say 112 you< you get assigned on it you get assigned on it so< so instead of buying it at 112 so instead of buying it at 112 you< you you first of all you'll be you'll be you you first of all you'll be you'll be assigned< assigned at 1 2 of 100 shares but when assigned at 1 2 of 100 shares but when you< you have the 82 cents it will remove uh you have the 82 cents it will remove uh you< you will be reducing the overall cost of you will be reducing the overall cost of this< this right so you minus 0. 82 so this this right so you minus 0.

82 so this gives< gives you roughly an average. price of gives you roughly an average price of 111. 18 111.

18 111. 18 all< all right all right 111.

18 111. 18 111.

18 so< so if you had so if you had not< not received this credit at all you'll not received this credit at all you'll be< be going long at this price but imagine be going long at this price but imagine if< if you could keep rolling it down and if you could keep rolling it down and each< each time you get a credit this will each time you get a credit this will reduce< reduce the cost basis of this price reduce the cost basis of this price until< until you could even get all the way until you could even get all the way down< down to maybe 110 or even lower down to maybe 110 or even lower okay< okay so next there are different type of okay so next there are different type of short< short put rows that you need to short put rows that you need to understand< understand when we are rolling short understand when we are rolling short puts< puts the first of which is rolling out puts the first of which is rolling out so< so rolling out just basically means to so rolling out just basically means to roll< roll to a further expiration date very roll to a further expiration date very simple< simple you are basically just adding simple you are basically just adding time< time so in this case you see we have time so in this case you see we have rolled< rolled from 12 august to 26th of august rolled from 12 august to 26th of august and< and we get a credit if as long as you and we get a credit if as long as you keep< keep the same strike keep the same strike and< and you're rolling out to a further and you're rolling out to a further expiration< expiration date you'll mostly always get expiration date you'll mostly always get a< a credit unless it's extremely deep in a credit unless it's extremely deep in the< the money then most likely it's the money then most likely it's harder< harder to get a credit but for the most harder to get a credit but for the most part< part you will be able to get a credit part you will be able to get a credit because< because you're adding time the next type because you're adding time the next type of< of role is rolling out and down and of role is rolling out and down and that's< that's a combination of two rows so that's a combination of two rows so basically< basically you're just rolling to a basically you're just rolling to a further< further expiration date further expiration date and< and then you're rolling down to a lower and then you're rolling down to a lower strike< strike price and for this you should be strike price and for this you should be able< able to get a credit because whenever able to get a credit because whenever you're< you're rolling out you get more you're rolling out you get more extrinsic< extrinsic value and you can use this extrinsic value and you can use this extrinsic< extrinsic value to offset the lowering extrinsic value to offset the lowering of< of your strike price so this is the most of your strike price so this is the most common< common role that you would do most common role that you would do most people< people would do because it just lowers people would do because it just lowers your your your your< your strike price and increases the your strike price and increases the chance< chance of you profiting on this on this chance of you profiting on this on this trade< trade right so when you lower the strike trade right so when you lower the strike price price price there's< there's a lesser chance for you to get there's a lesser chance for you to get assigned< assigned as well assigned as well now< now the third type of role is the least now the third type of role is the least common< common type of role but there are some common type of role but there are some people< people that actually you know do this people that actually you know do this and< and i also have done this before and and i also have done this before and i'll< i'll show you a trade example later on i'll show you a trade example later on of< of of when i would roll up my uh put of of when i would roll up my uh put option< option because most of the time nobody option because most of the time nobody really< really wants to roll up right if the really wants to roll up right if the price< price let's say for example price let's say for example you< you had a strike at 112 you had a strike at 112 and< and if the stock price does not touch and if the stock price does not touch one< one one two just doing those somewhere one one two just doing those somewhere above< above here above here you< you know all you have to do is just let you know all you have to do is just let it< it expire worthless and you just receive it expire worthless and you just receive the< the full credit of the short put that the full credit of the short put that you< you sold it for in the first place right you sold it for in the first place right there's< there's no need for you to roll it up to there's no need for you to roll it up to a< a higher price a higher price and< and then risk it the market coming down and then risk it the market coming down and< and then you getting assigned at this and then you getting assigned at this price price price right< right so right so this< this is the least common role but this is the least common role but normally< normally when people want to do a normally when people want to do a roll-up< roll-up that's because they think that roll-up that's because they think that the< the market will continue to go up and the market will continue to go up and they< they want to receive some credit on this they want to receive some credit on this so< so for this what you do is simply just so for this what you do is simply just roll< roll to a higher strike price roll to a higher strike price now< now there's one thing you notice is that now there's one thing you notice is that you< you do not see a roll down you do not you do not see a roll down you do not see< see a rolling down see a rolling down just< just on its own just on its own and< and the reason is because when you roll and the reason is because when you roll down< down it will never be for a credit you down it will never be for a credit you see< see when you're rolling down you're see when you're rolling down you're actually< actually having to pay actually having to pay rather< rather than receiving a credit and rather than receiving a credit and that's< that's because the option prices are that's because the option prices are getting< getting less uh getting cheaper and getting less uh getting cheaper and cheaper< cheaper on the way down right so for cheaper on the way down right so for example< example if you have a 1 1 2 strike price example if you have a 1 1 2 strike price versus< versus a 100 strike price versus a 100 strike price this< this will always cost more this will always cost more for< for a put compared to this for a put compared to this so< so if you are rolling down what you're so if you are rolling down what you're doing< doing is you're buying the more doing is you're buying the more expensive< expensive uh expensive uh put< put option back put option back and< and then you're selling a cheaper one and then you're selling a cheaper one so< so this will never give you a credit it so this will never give you a credit it will< will always be a debit so let's say for will always be a debit so let's say for example< example you're buying this bag maybe for example you're buying this bag maybe for let's< let's say five dollars let's say five dollars and< and then this all the way back down you and then this all the way back down you can< can only sell for one dollar then your can only sell for one dollar then your net< net is actually a negative net is actually a negative four< four dollars four dollars so< so that is why uh people don't really so that is why uh people don't really roll< roll down roll down and< and i wouldn't suggest that you roll and i wouldn't suggest that you roll down< down as well unless you have a very good down as well unless you have a very good reason< reason for wanting to do that all right reason for wanting to do that all right so< so basically these are the three types so basically these are the three types of< of rows of rows so so so now< now that you know the three different now that you know the three different type< type of rows when do you exactly roll type of rows when do you exactly roll them< them okay so there are three scenarios them okay so there are three scenarios so< so the first scenario is when the short so the first scenario is when the short put< put is in the money so this is the most put is in the money so this is the most common< common one so for example you have a common one so for example you have a short< short put say at around 109 short put say at around 109 and< and the market has dropped down and the market has dropped down to to to 101< 101 so this is in the money already so 101 so this is in the money already so this< this is the time where you want to start this is the time where you want to start rolling rolling rolling to< to avoid you know to avoid you know getting< getting the possibility of getting getting the possibility of getting assigned< assigned so once you roll most likely assigned so once you roll most likely you< you want to roll out and down so you you want to roll out and down so you roll< roll to a further expiration date and roll to a further expiration date and you< you try to roll as down as far down as you try to roll as down as far down as possible< possible of a strike price that you can possible of a strike price that you can get< get okay so this is the first scenario get okay so this is the first scenario which< which is to roll when the short put is which is to roll when the short put is in< in the money in the money now< now the next scenario is when the short now the next scenario is when the short put< put is at the money now this is the most put is at the money now this is the most defensive< defensive right so defensive right so you< you most likely do not want the you most likely do not want the uh< uh put to have any chance of getting uh put to have any chance of getting assigned< assigned so in this case you wait until assigned so in this case you wait until the the the stock< stock price basically reaches your stock price basically reaches your strike< strike price and then you start to roll strike price and then you start to roll okay< okay so okay so most< most likely you'll be doing a rolling most likely you'll be doing a rolling out< out and rolling down to a out and rolling down to a lower< lower strike price so this is the most lower strike price so this is the most defensive< defensive and also defensive and also the< the one that you have the least chance the one that you have the least chance of< of getting a sign of getting a sign but< but the drawback of this is that you but the drawback of this is that you would< would have to keep rolling out to a would have to keep rolling out to a further< further expiration date the moment the further expiration date the moment the price< price reaches so imagine if you had from price reaches so imagine if you had from this< this price this price you< you wrote down to say a price around 90 you wrote down to say a price around 90 but< but if the stock drops again but if the stock drops again you< you have to roll out again and. each time you have to roll out again and each time you're< you're rolling out you're rolling out is< is always a further and further is always a further and further expiration< expiration date so if you started off expiration date so if you started off with< with 45 days with 45 days if< if within the next five days you wrote if within the next five days you wrote the< the market has dropped down to your next the market has dropped down to your next strike< strike price of your short put they strike price of your short put they wrote< wrote to wrote to so< so five days has passed so now from 40 so five days has passed so now from 40 days< days you will be rolling to maybe days you will be rolling to maybe 90< 90 days right so 90 days right so and< and if another five days has passed and and if another five days has passed and it< it dropped again then you want to roll it dropped again then you want to roll from< from here maybe this time you have to from here maybe this time you have to roll< roll to 150 days roll to 150 days so so so what< what happens is that if the market does what happens is that if the market does go< go up you can't exactly realize this go up you can't exactly realize this profit< profit immediately you have to wait profit immediately you have to wait until< until the 150 days have passed until the 150 days have passed before< before you can realize the full uh before you can realize the full uh profit< profit the credit that you receive on profit the credit that you receive on the< the short put and the subsequent rows so the short put and the subsequent rows so while< while it is the while it is the uh uh uh put< put rolling option where you get the put rolling option where you get the least< least chance of getting a sign it's also least chance of getting a sign it's also the< the one where uh it takes the longest the one where uh it takes the longest for< for you to fully realize your profit by for you to fully realize your profit by the< the way if you've enjoyed this video so the way if you've enjoyed this video so far< far i'd appreciate if you hit the far i'd appreciate if you hit the subscribe< subscribe button and just give a thumbs subscribe button and just give a thumbs up< up so i can create more videos like this up so i can create more videos like this for< for you in the future all right back to for you in the future all right back to the< the video okay so the third scenario to the video okay so the third scenario to roll< roll is when the short put is out of the roll is when the short put is out of the money< money and the market is going up now money and the market is going up now this< this is the most aggressive and this is this is the most aggressive and this is also< also when you feel that you know you also when you feel that you know you have< have no chance or there's very little have no chance or there's very little chance< chance for the market to come back down chance for the market to come back down again< again after that so for this you want to again after that so for this you want to try< try and capture more profit on the short try and capture more profit on the short put< put right so for example if you have put right so for example if you have sold< sold this let's say for one dollar and sold this let's say for one dollar and you< you see that hey there's a support down you see that hey there's a support down here< here and maybe you look at the here and maybe you look at the indicators< indicators it's indicating that it's indicators it's indicating that it's oversold< oversold and you think that instead of oversold and you think that instead of this< this going down you're thinking that this going down you're thinking that there's< there's a very good chance you could go there's a very good chance you could go back< back up back up so< so what you could do is to roll it up so what you could do is to roll it up maybe< maybe you can roll up below this support maybe you can roll up below this support area< area all right you can roll below this area all right you can roll below this support< support area let me just change the support area let me just change the color color color so< so you can just roll up to the next so you can just roll up to the next support< support uh below the next support maybe support uh below the next support maybe at< at 96 dollars and then for this maybe at 96 dollars and then for this maybe you< you can collect an additional maybe 50 you can collect an additional maybe 50 cents< cents or maybe even cents or maybe even maybe< maybe even a dollar on it so this way maybe even a dollar on it so this way you< you get you get uh< uh both of the credit total of a dollar uh both of the credit total of a dollar fifty< fifty cents so if the market really does fifty cents so if the market really does shoot< shoot up in the end it expires above shoot up in the end it expires above this< this strike price you'll get this full this strike price you'll get this full credit< credit so credit so this< this is the most uh aggressive way that this is the most uh aggressive way that you< you want to roll and in fact i have you want to roll and in fact i have actually< actually done this on a trade on fico actually done this on a trade on fico which< which i want to share with you right now which i want to share with you right now so< so this is fico which is fair isaac so this is fico which is fair isaac corporation< corporation so on this date corporation so on this date basically< basically i saw the market was coming basically i saw the market was coming down< down it has been oversold for down it has been oversold for for< for quite a while right now for quite a while right now and< and the market is coming has been coming and the market is coming has been coming down< down quite uh very strongly so i decided down quite uh very strongly so i decided that< that hey on this date you know i wanted that hey on this date you know i wanted to< to sell a put because to sell a put because i< i feel that fair isaac corporation i feel that fair isaac corporation unifico< unifico is a pretty solid company strong unifico is a pretty solid company strong fundamentals< fundamentals they are the one with the fundamentals they are the one with the fico< fico credit scores and most of the fico credit scores and most of the institutions< institutions right now are still relying institutions right now are still relying on< on fico's cause you know to assess their on fico's cause you know to assess their clients< clients so i decided that you know if i clients so i decided that you know if i were< were to actually get fuel on the short were to actually get fuel on the short put< put i wouldn't mind as well because i put i wouldn't mind as well because i have< have the cash so have the cash so for< for this trade on the 18th of uh for this trade on the 18th of uh november< november you can see down here november you can see down here i< i sold the i sold the 360< 360 put and received a pretty nice 360 put and received a pretty nice credit< credit it's about 14 so what i did down credit it's about 14 so what i did down here< here is i sold here is i sold pretty< pretty much and at the money a put pretty much and at the money a put option option option i< i sort of added money put option for 360 i sort of added money put option for 360 received< received 14 and 10 cents received 14 and 10 cents now< now a few days later right just a a few now a few days later right just a a few days< days later only roughly about five six days later only roughly about five six days< days or so days or so all< all right the market went below my all right the market went below my strike< strike price my initial strike price strike price my initial strike price was< was at 360 was at 360 okay okay okay and< and then it went down all the way to and then it went down all the way to around< around three four two which is roughly around three four two which is roughly down< down here so this was roughly where my down here so this was roughly where my break-even< break-even price is so i thought to break-even price is so i thought to myself< myself you know myself you know i< i think i want to try and roll out and i think i want to try and roll out and down< down to try and get a better price right down to try and get a better price right because< because at the point of time it seems because at the point of time it seems like< like you know there's a lot of like you know there's a lot of relentless< relentless selling relentless selling and< and i just figured that if the market and i just figured that if the market was< was to continue to go down was to continue to go down i< i would like a 350 i wouldn't mind a 350 i would like a 350 i wouldn't mind a 350 i< i mean 360 was good but if i could get i mean 360 was good but if i could get 350< 350 field 350 field i< i wouldn't mind that as well so what i i wouldn't mind that as well so what i did< did was i rolled the shot put down to did was i rolled the shot put down to 350< 350 and i received a credit of 76 cents 350 and i received a credit of 76 cents so< so that's 76 dollars so as you can see so that's 76 dollars so as you can see rolling< rolling again just means to buy back the rolling again just means to buy back the 360< 360 i bought back the 360 and then i 360 i bought back the 360 and then i sold< sold right to open i sold the 350 put so sold right to open i sold the 350 put so in< in essence i'm basically just closing in essence i'm basically just closing out< out this loss and then selling another out this loss and then selling another one< one to make up for more than the loss one to make up for more than the loss that< that i made so this is essentially that i made so this is essentially rolling< rolling so i rolled down to the 350 rolling so i rolled down to the 350 strike< strike price strike price now< now let's see what happens next so now let's see what happens next so on< on the on the uh< uh 31st of december uh 31st of december uh< uh the market shot up right ma fico went uh the market shot up right ma fico went all< all the way up and all the way up and uh< uh in hindsight it was quite unfortunate uh in hindsight it was quite unfortunate that< that i didn't get fuel because it would that i didn't get fuel because it would be< be fantastic if i had been filled at 350 be fantastic if i had been filled at 350 and< and i would write this profit all the and i would write this profit all the way< way up here but of course way up here but of course as< as a as a fit< fit would have it that the market fit would have it that the market started< started to rally back up so when it started to rally back up so when it rallied< rallied back up so strongly i felt that rallied back up so strongly i felt that you< you know there was very little chance you know there was very little chance that< that it would come all the way back down that it would come all the way back down to< to 370. so instead of just getting that to 370.

so instead of just getting that uh< uh you know to be satisfied by just uh you know to be satisfied by just letting< letting my option expire letting my option expire i< i decided to roll up so i wanted to roll i decided to roll up so i wanted to roll up< up to the 370 strike price which i felt up to the 370 strike price which i felt was< was still quite a decent uh distance was still quite a decent uh distance away< away from you know my shot put getting away from you know my shot put getting uh uh uh touched touched touched so< so on this date on the 31st what i did so on this date on the 31st what i did was< was i bought back the 350 put and i sold was i bought back the 350 put and i sold the< the 370 puts so this is basically me the 370 puts so this is basically me rolling rolling rolling uh< uh out i rolled it to a further uh out i rolled it to a further expiration< expiration date and then i rolled it up expiration date and then i rolled it up as< as well so this gave me an additional as well so this gave me an additional two<. two dollars and 43 cents in credit total two dollars and 43 cents in credit total of of of 243< 243 dollars so this is one of the 243 dollars so this is one of the reasons< reasons or one of the times when you reasons or one of the times when you also< also can consider rolling up when you also can consider rolling up when you can< can see you know there's a strong move can see you know there's a strong move up< up and you think that the market has a up and you think that the market has a stronger< stronger probability of it going up than stronger probability of it going up than it< it going down it going down so< so try enough later on on expiration so try enough later on on expiration date< date it expired worthless so as you can date it expired worthless so as you can see< see from see from from< from this point on it actually it shot from this point on it actually it shot up< up even more so like i said you know up even more so like i said you know as< as fit would have it i didn't get feel as fit would have it i didn't get feel at< at the 350 350 or 360. you know if i at the 350 350 or 360.

you know if i have< have got gotten filled on this would be have got gotten filled on this would be a< a very nice profit right a very nice profit right but< but that's fine as well because i've got but that's fine as well because i've got a< a pretty decent credit all together for a pretty decent credit all together for this< this trade so this trade you can see this trade so this trade you can see total< total i made 14 plus two dollars total i made 14 plus two dollars and< and another one dollar between these two and another one dollar between these two so< so total roughly about 17 so that's a so total roughly about 17 so that's a thousand thousand thousand seven< seven hundred dollars which is not too seven hundred dollars. which is not too bad< bad for this trade all right so i want bad for this trade all right so i want to to to explain< explain to you the difference between explain to you the difference between rolling< rolling short put when it's in the money rolling short put when it's in the money versus< versus when it's at the money and this versus when it's at the money and this is< is very important to understand because is very important to understand because it< it is it is understanding< understanding how you transfer extrinsic understanding how you transfer extrinsic value< value so for this just take a look at value so for this just take a look at this< this example this is iwm so right now this example this is iwm so right now the< the price is 178. 69 so let's just take the price is 178.

69 so let's just take uh< uh 179 just we'll just round it up right uh 179 just we'll just round it up right so< so let's just imagine right now the so let's just imagine right now the price< price is at 179 okay so let's compare price is at 179 okay so let's compare the< the two different rolling so for this the two different rolling so for this one< one you can see that this is uh you're one you can see that this is uh you're rolling< rolling and in the money put so the rolling and in the money put so the strike< strike price which you are rolling from strike price which you are rolling from is< is from 185 to 180 so what this means is is from 185 to 180 so what this means is that< that you originally had a that you originally had a short< short put at 185 okay you shot uh put at short put at 185 okay you shot uh put at 185< 185 and then the market 185 and then the market all< all right the market most likely right all right the market most likely right it< it went all the way down it went all the way down okay< okay to the 179 price so your short put okay to the 179 price so your short put is< is now in the money all right so what is now in the money all right so what you< you did is you rolled it as you can see you did is you rolled it as you can see you< you rolled it from 185 to 180 you rolled it from 185 to 180 so so so we< we roll it all the way down let me just we roll it all the way down let me just change< change the color on that change the color on that right< right we roll it down right we roll it down to< to 180 which is uh to 180 which is uh pretty< pretty much uh pretty much uh at< at the money at the money and< and then you notice that we are able to and then you notice that we are able to still< still get a credit for rolling this so still get a credit for rolling this so this< this is 23 cents and we roll out to a this is 23 cents and we roll out to a further< further expiration date so this is the further expiration date so this is the lowest< lowest strike that we could roll down to lowest strike that we could roll down to uh< uh to get a credit if we were to roll uh to get a credit if we were to roll any< any lower this would become a debit so any lower this would become a debit so as< as much as possible we always want to as much as possible we always want to keep< keep it as a credit so when we wrote keep it as a credit so when we wrote down down down we< we could roll down five dollars in we could roll down five dollars in strike< strike price okay so if this is an in strike price okay so if this is an in the< the money roll this is an in the money the money roll this is an in the money put< put option put option so< so let us compare it if we were to roll so let us compare it if we were to roll it< it when it is at the money okay so uh it when it is at the money okay so uh let's< let's say the market now comes down here let's say the market now comes down here and< and then when it touches our strike and then when it touches our strike price< price at 179 in this case 179 then we price at 179 in this case 179 then we decide< decide to roll so from 179 we can roll decide to roll so from 179 we can roll it< it all the way down to it all the way down to one one one seven< seven zero all right you can see 179 we seven zero all right you can see 179 we wrote< wrote down to 170 and we could get a wrote down to 170 and we could get a three< three dollars credit so this is the three dollars credit so this is the lowest< lowest that we can roll to lowest that we can roll to for< for a credit okay so for a credit okay so if< if you notice if you notice this< this row this row is< is a nine dollars a row is a nine dollars a row whereas< whereas for the in the money put option whereas for the in the money put option you< you could only roll down five dollars in you could only roll down five dollars in strike< strike price strike price and< and the reason is because and the reason is because now< now if you already watch the video where now if you already watch the video where i< i talk about in the money put options i talk about in the money put options you< you will you will remember< remember that remember that the< the in the money put option consists of the in the money put option consists of two two two values< values right first you have the values right first you have the intrinsic< intrinsic value and then you have the intrinsic value and then you have the extrinsic< extrinsic value extrinsic value so so so recap< recap intrinsic value is just basically recap intrinsic value is just basically the< the difference in price between the the difference in price between the strike< strike price and the current stock price strike price and the current stock price right< right so this in the money so the reason right so this in the money so the reason you< you cannot roll much uh to a lower you cannot roll much uh to a lower strike< strike price strike price compared< compared to the at the money roll is compared to the at the money roll is because< because most of the value of this uh in because most of the value of this uh in the< the money is intrinsic value that means the money is intrinsic value that means you< you have very little extrinsic value and you have very little extrinsic value and we< we have very little extrinsic value we have very little extrinsic value there's< there's not much you can transfer to the there's not much you can transfer to the following< following expiration month whereas for following expiration month whereas for the< the at the money it is 100 extrinsic the at the money it is 100 extrinsic value< value so there is a lot of extrinsic value so there is a lot of extrinsic value< value for you to transfer to the value for you to transfer to the following< following uh expiration date so that is following uh expiration date so that is why< why when the why when the uh< uh strike is uh strike is when< when the when the price< price is right at the money you're able price is right at the money you're able to to to roll< roll much further down compared to if roll much further down compared to if you< you had that in the money you had that in the money put< put option put option now< now this this rolling down will actually now this this rolling down will actually uh< uh this five dollars you see down here uh this five dollars you see down here will< will get lesser and lesser as you get will get lesser and lesser as you get deeper< deeper and deeper in the money so for deeper and deeper in the money so for example< example if instead you had another example if instead you had another strike< strike let's say your strike is 190 strike let's say your strike is 190 instead< instead then in this case you wouldn't instead then in this case you wouldn't be< be able to roll down five dollars be able to roll down five dollars you< you probably may only roll down maybe you probably may only roll down maybe two< two dollars to three dollars two dollars to three dollars so< so this is the thing to so this is the thing to understand< understand the further you let your put understand the further you let your put option< option get in the money option get in the money the< the lesser you're able to roll down uh the lesser you're able to roll down uh the< the strike price all right if you were the strike price all right if you were to< to compare to compare to< to the same expiration date as the at to the same expiration date as the at the< the money right the money right the< the on the other hand the positive side the on the other hand the positive side of< of waiting until it's in the money of waiting until it's in the money before< before you roll is that you actually before you roll is that you actually give< give time for the market to recover you give time for the market to recover you give< give time for the stock to actually give time for the stock to actually rebound< rebound back up rebound back up you< you know before you decide to roll all you know before you decide to roll all right< right so for example right so for example you< you had a you had a short< short boot let's say at 180 short boot let's say at 180 and< and. let's say the market goes down all and let's say the market goes down all right< right it could before you decided to right it could before you decided to roll< roll it could come back up right so in roll it could come back up right so in this< this case some time this case some time has< has already passed and when it goes back has already passed and when it goes back up< up a lot of the extrinsic value which up a lot of the extrinsic value which you< you sold it for initially would have you sold it for initially would have really< really expired really expired now< now if you had actually now if you had actually rolled< rolled it the moment it touched your rolled it the moment it touched your strike< strike price strike price so< so let's say in this case so let's say in this case let's< let's say you decided to roll it the let's say you decided to roll it the moment< moment it touched this moment it touched this strike< strike price of your short put and you strike price of your short put and you decided< decided to immediately roll it down decided to immediately roll it down then< then what happens is that you have then what happens is that you have already< already extended already extended your< your time your time so< so maybe this is from a say 30 days you so maybe this is from a say 30 days you have< have rolled it out maybe to 60 days have rolled it out maybe to 60 days and< and then the market and then the market actually< actually did go back up in the end actually did go back up in the end so< so that means so that means in< in the first place you may not even have in the first place you may not even have to< to roll to roll this< this short put because it went above the this short put because it went above the initial< initial strike price which you had and initial strike price which you had and then< then maybe some time would have passed then maybe some time would have passed and< and then it will be less than 30 days and then it will be less than 30 days and< and you can just wait a little bit and you can just wait a little bit longer longer longer and< and this could most likely expire out of and this could most likely expire out of the< the money and you keep the whole credit the money and you keep the whole credit but< but because you have already rolled down but because you have already rolled down instead< instead of waiting just 30 days you now instead of waiting just 30 days you now have< have to wait much longer before you can have to wait much longer before you can realize< realize the full profits on this uh realize the full profits on this uh strike< strike price which you have broke down strike price which you have broke down to< to so this is the difference between uh to so this is the difference between uh rolling< rolling in the money and at the money rolling in the money and at the money and< and it's very and it's very important< important for you to understand important for you to understand especially< especially when you start to make the especially when you start to make the decision< decision to roll your short put okay so decision to roll your short put okay so now< now i want to share with you three now i want to share with you three systematic< systematic methods to roll your short systematic methods to roll your short put< put all right so the very first method put all right so the very first method is< is to roll when there's 21 days to is to roll when there's 21 days to expiration< expiration left expiration left if< if it's in the money if it's all the if it's in the money if it's all the money< money you don't touch it the moment it money you don't touch it the moment it gets< gets in the money then you start to roll gets in the money then you start to roll it< it so for example it so for example let's< let's say you have a let's say you have a a< a put a put at< at 180 all right let me just change the at 180 all right let me just change the color< color of that let's say you have a color of that let's say you have a shortboard< shortboard 180 shortboard 180 so< so during this whole time let's say you so during this whole time let's say you sold< sold this during the sold this during the 45< 45 days to expiration date all right 45 days to expiration date all right that's< that's 45 days to dte so during this that's 45 days to dte so during this whole< whole time regardless what the market do whole time regardless what the market do if< if it goes down up all the way down no if it goes down up all the way down no matter< matter where it goes to right you do not matter where it goes to right you do not do< do any rolling do any rolling until until until you< you reach the 21 days month until it you reach the 21 days month until it becomes< becomes 21 days to expiration so when 21 becomes 21 days to expiration so when 21 days< days you look at your position and you days you look at your position and you take< take a look at where it is if it's in take a look at where it is if it's in the< the money then you start your roll if the money then you start your roll if it's< it's out of the money you leave it alone it's out of the money you leave it alone until< until it becomes in the money then you until it becomes in the money then you start< start rolling again so start rolling again so there< there are some pros and cons with this there are some pros and cons with this so< so the pros is that this is a very so the pros is that this is a very simple< simple uh method of rolling and the simple uh method of rolling and the least< least time consuming so if you don't least time consuming so if you don't really< really have much time to stay at the really have much time to stay at the screen< screen or maybe you have uh you're screen or maybe you have uh you're working< working full time then this is the best working full time then this is the best thing< thing because all you have to do is just thing because all you have to do is just monitor< monitor when it's 21 dte look at your monitor when it's 21 dte look at your position< position if it's in the money you roll position if it's in the money you roll if< if it's out of money you just leave it if it's out of money you just leave it so< so that's a very simple way to manage it so that's a very simple way to manage it and< and there's also a very low probability and there's also a very low probability of< of getting assigned because there's of getting assigned because there's still< still quite a number of days left to still quite a number of days left to expiration< expiration right expiration right now< now of course you still can get a sign now of course you still can get a sign if< if it's very very deep in the money if if it's very very deep in the money if you< you want to play safe you could maybe you want to play safe you could maybe just< just roll it instead of you know 21 dt just roll it instead of you know 21 dt you< you could say 30 dtes you could wait you could say 30 dtes you could wait until< until 30 dte and you see if it's in the until 30 dte and you see if it's in the money< money then you decide to roll because money then you decide to roll because chances< chances are when there's still 30 days chances are when there's still 30 days left< left to the expiration of this option left to the expiration of this option there's< there's still quite a bit of extrinsic there's still quite a bit of extrinsic value< value so when there's quite a bit of value so when there's quite a bit of extrinsic< extrinsic value there's very little extrinsic value there's very little chance< chance that this option will get excised chance that this option will get excised so< so when you keep it uh the the rolling so when you keep it uh the the rolling to to to a< a number of days like this a number of days like this there's< there's very little chance of you there's very little chance of you getting< getting a sign getting a sign and< and at the same time you also allow time and at the same time you also allow time for< for the trade to work out so for example for the trade to work out so for example as< as i mentioned earlier let's say you as i mentioned earlier let's say you have< have a 45 days dte and this is the have a 45 days dte and this is the strike< strike price that you have strike price that you have say< say again at 180. say again at 180.

#### Topic 1

now now now if< if you decided to roll the moment it if you decided to roll the moment it touched touched touched this< this strike price it may touch maybe in this strike price it may touch maybe in three< three days then you're gonna roll it three days then you're gonna roll it down< down immediately say 270 down immediately say 270 right right right but< but if you just use this 21 dte method but if you just use this 21 dte method it< it may just go down it may just go down and< and then come back up and then come back up and< and all this is before 21 dte so you and all this is before 21 dte so you didn't< didn't have to do anything at all if you didn't have to do anything at all if you based< based on this 21 dt you didn't have to based on this 21 dt you didn't have to roll< roll at all so it allows time for the roll at all so it allows time for the trade< trade to work out in your favor as well trade to work out in your favor as well right< right so those are the pros now the cons right so those are the pros now the cons is< is that it could be deep in the money is that it could be deep in the money when< when it's time to roll and when it's when it's time to roll and when it's deep< deep in the money as you as i shared deep in the money as you as i shared with< with you earlier it becomes harder for with you earlier it becomes harder for you< you to roll down right this lesser you to roll down right this lesser strike< strike price and in certain cases if strike price and in certain cases if it's< it's so deep in the money you realize it's so deep in the money you realize that< that you can't even roll down that you can't even roll down unless< unless you roll to extremely far away unless you roll to extremely far away right< right like maybe a year out then you can right like maybe a year out then you can roll< roll down by then it will kind of defeat roll down by then it will kind of defeat the< the purpose of a short put because short the purpose of a short put because short put< put is meant to have theta is to be put is meant to have theta is to be you're< you're meant to have time decay and if you're meant to have time decay and if you< you were to sell an option that is uh you were to sell an option that is uh one< one year away the decay is so little one year away the decay is so little that< that it kind of defeats the purpose of that it kind of defeats the purpose of selling< selling the short put in the first place selling the short put in the first place so< so this is one of the cons so this is one of the cons the< the second thing is that you may not be the second thing is that you may not be able< able to roll for a credit as mentioned able to roll for a credit as mentioned so< so if very deep in the money then it'll so if very deep in the money then it'll be< be very difficult for you to roll for a be very difficult for you to roll for a credit< credit and in some cases you will credit and in some cases you will realize< realize that even though you roll out to realize that even though you roll out to a< a further strike sorry to a further a further strike sorry to a further expiration< expiration date but still the strike expiration date but still the strike price< price same strike price price same strike price you< you actually have to pay a debit right you actually have to pay a debit right because< because of the billion r spread and the because of the billion r spread and the further< further away your bill and ask spreads further away your bill and ask spreads become< become wider so in this case there's become wider so in this case there's more< more slippage in terms of your more slippage in terms of your order< order so that's how you would you know order so that's how you would you know in< in certain cases you would even get a in certain cases you would even get a debit< debit rather than a credit debit rather than a credit okay< okay so the second method is the okay so the second method is the aggressive< aggressive method which i've shared with aggressive method which i've shared with you< you earlier and that is to roll when you earlier and that is to roll when it's< it's at the money it's at the money so< so the pros of this is that you won't so the pros of this is that you won't get< get a sign because the moment it reaches get a sign because the moment it reaches your< your strike price you're just gonna roll your strike price you're just gonna roll right< right if the market comes down here right if the market comes down here all< all right you're gonna roll it down and all right you're gonna roll it down and if< if it drops again you're just gonna roll if it drops again you're just gonna roll it< it down again and you just keep doing it down again and you just keep doing this< this rolling a rolling basically to this rolling a rolling basically to perpetually< perpetually right you roll until the perpetually right you roll until the furthest< furthest strike furthest expiration date furthest strike furthest expiration date possible possible possible and< and yeah and that's why you can roll to and yeah and that's why you can roll to the< the furthest strike possible the furthest strike possible because< because it's at the money you have the because it's at the money you have the most< most extrinsic value as explained most extrinsic value as explained earlier< earlier and also you have the highest earlier and also you have the highest win< win rate why because as mentioned uh win rate why because as mentioned uh much< much earlier in the slides when you have much earlier in the slides when you have a< a lower strike price it gives a much a lower strike price it gives a much better< better chance for the stock to better chance for the stock to eventually eventually eventually recover< recover for example it's easier for the recover for example it's easier for the market< market right to go above 180 than it is market right to go above 180 than it is to< now< now the cons of this method is that now the cons of this method. is that there< there is a longer expiration date which there is a longer expiration date which means< means it takes a longer time to realize means it takes a longer time to realize your< your profits so this is uh some of the your profits so this is uh some of the things< things that i've done before i've tried things that i've done before i've tried to< to roll it at the money to the point to roll it at the money to the point where< where i was stuck with a short put of where i was stuck with a short put of roughly< roughly almost a year to go so i'll be roughly almost a year to go so i'll be stuck< stuck in that position even though the stuck in that position even though the market< market have since then rallied way above market have since then rallied way above my< my strike price my strike price the< the the the option the the the option the< the shot put which i had still had many the shot put which i had still had many days< days left to go now i could definitely days left to go now i could definitely close< close it but if i close it you know close it but if i close it you know there< there will be still some uh there will be still some uh value< value that's lost or you may not get value that's lost or you may not get more< more profit as you originally did more profit as you originally did earlier< earlier on because of this rose earlier on because of this rose and< and it's also the one which you have the and it's also the one which you have the most< most active management so you can most active management so you can imagine< imagine that you always have to ensure imagine that you always have to ensure that< that your platform or rather that your platform or rather some< some alerts if you have that you will some alerts if you have that you will roll< roll it the moment you touch your strike roll it the moment you touch your strike price< price now the third method is to roll price now the third method is to roll when< when it breaches your break-even point when it breaches your break-even point so< so there is a break-even point which is so there is a break-even point which is basically< basically the basically the strike< strike price and minus of your premium strike price and minus of your premium right< right so let's say if your strike price right so let's say if your strike price is< is a hundred dollars is a hundred dollars you< you sold it at a hundred you sold it at a hundred and< and then you receive a dollars you and then you receive a dollars you receive< receive one dollar receive one dollar in< in premium so in this case your break in premium so in this case your break even< even will be 99 even will be 99 right< right so the moment the price if it right so the moment the price if it comes< comes down to 100 comes down to 100 which< which is at the money you don't roll it which is at the money you don't roll it yet< yet you wait until it goes to 99 yet you wait until it goes to 99 then< then you can consider rolling so then you can consider rolling so this< this is what it means to grow when it this is what it means to grow when it breaches< breaches your break even point all right breaches your break even point all right so< so what are the pros the pros is that so what are the pros the pros is that you< you give more time for the trade to work you give more time for the trade to work out< out so out so compared< compared to this if you were to wait compared to this if you were to wait until< until it goes in the money all right until it goes in the money all right it< it may just go back up before touching it may just go back up before touching your< your break-even point your break-even point so< so in this case you actually didn't even so in this case you actually didn't even have< have to roll at all have to roll at all and< and also you have a very low probability and also you have a very low probability of< of getting a sign because you're not of getting a sign because you're not letting< letting it go very deep in the money letting it go very deep in the money right< right if it goes to your break even right if it goes to your break even point point point chances< chances are it's not very deep in the chances are it's not very deep in the money< money so at this point you still are money so at this point you still are able< able to roll able to roll out< out and down out and down for< for quite a good number of points down for quite a good number of points down okay now< now the cons of this is that you can't now the cons of this is that you can't roll< roll the strike price down as far as the roll the strike price down as far as

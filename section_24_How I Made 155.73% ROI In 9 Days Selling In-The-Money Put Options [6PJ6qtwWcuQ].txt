73 in< in nine days so i want to very quickly in nine days so i want to very quickly just< just go through this trade with you and just go through this trade with you and share< share with you the reason why i decided share with you the reason why i decided to< to send in the money put option as to send in the money put option as opposed< opposed to selling and out of the money opposed to selling and out of the money production< production which is that's what most production which is that's what most people< people do or even selling at the money people do or even selling at the money put< put option put option okay< okay so this trade was done on the qqq's okay so this trade was done on the qqq's and< and on the 23rd of may this was what i and on the 23rd of may this was what i saw< saw you can see that the market has been saw you can see that the market has been selling< selling off uh pretty hard as there's selling off uh pretty hard as there's been< been a slew of bad news coming out and been a slew of bad news coming out and you< you can see the stochastic oscillator you can see the stochastic oscillator it's< it's been showing that it's been it's been showing that it's been oversold< oversold for quite some time now right oversold for quite some time now right so< so on the 23rd of may at the price of so on the 23rd of may at the price of 290< 290 i went to 290 i went to sell< sell a cash output with a strike of sell a cash output with a strike of three< three hundred dollars right with a 65 three hundred dollars right with a 65 delta< delta and there's uh days to expiration delta and there's uh days to expiration left< left is 53 i sold it for twenty dollars left is 53 i sold it for twenty dollars and< and one cent so that is two thousand and one cent so that is two thousand dollars< dollars and dollars and two< two thousand and one dollars in a two thousand and one dollars in a premium premium premium so< so you might be wondering why did i sell so you might be wondering why did i sell an< an in the money put option as opposed to an in the money put option as opposed to selling< selling maybe an out of the money selling maybe an out of the money where< where i could have sold maybe the 260 where i could have sold maybe the 260 strike< strike or maybe even the 270 strike strike or maybe even the 270 strike or< or why didn't i at least try to sell and or why didn't i at least try to sell and add< add the money at around 290 right so why add the money at around 290 right so why did< did you want to sell in the money it did you want to sell in the money it just< just doesn't make sense right am i crazy just doesn't make sense right am i crazy am< am i out of my mind right so hear me out am i out of my mind right so hear me out let< let me explain you see let me explain you see the< the reason i decided to sell this uh in the reason i decided to sell this uh in the< the money production was because this the money production was because this was< was what i saw was what i saw right< right the market has been making new right the market has been making new lows lows lows and< and then as you can see it's making a a and then as you can see it's making a a lower< lower low low high lower low and then lower low low high lower low and then there's< there's a resistance at this point down there's a resistance at this point down here< here you can see this was the previous here you can see this was the previous low< low so price tried to break below this low so price tried to break below this low< low but it couldn't go below this and it low but it couldn't go below this and it closed< closed above this closed above this previous< previous low and then it formed this previous low and then it formed this nice< nice candle stick down here this is what nice candle stick down here this is what we< we call a pin bar all right let me just we call a pin bar all right let me just remove< remove this remove this drawing< drawing so you can see this clearer drawing so you can see this clearer so< so this is what you call a pin bar a so this is what you call a pin bar a bullish< bullish pin bar bullish pin bar and and and uh< uh basically what it indicates is that uh basically what it indicates is that there's< there's a good chance the market right there's a good chance the market right the< the bulls are winning there's that the the bulls are winning there's that the market< market has a higher probability that market has a higher probability that will< will go up then it will go down now of will go up then it will go down now of course< course this is not guaranteed but there course this is not guaranteed but there is< is a higher probability with this panel is a higher probability with this panel with< with this candlestick pattern because it with this candlestick pattern because it was< was paired off was paired off with with with a< a break of a previous low where it a break of a previous low where it couldn't< couldn't close below it and it ended up couldn't close below it and it ended up closing< closing above on top of that there is a closing above on top of that there is a divergence< divergence so you can see divergence so you can see the< the market is making lower lows right the market is making lower lows right so so so let< let me just use another color here so let me just use another color here so it's< it's making a lower low down here but if it's making a lower low down here but if you< you were to take a look at the you were to take a look at the stochastics< stochastics this is the stochastics it's stochastics this is the stochastics it's showing< showing that it's making a showing that it's making a higher< higher low higher low right< right you can see it's making a higher right you can see it's making a higher low< low but this is making a low low so this low but this is making a low low so this is< is what we call a divergence now is what we call a divergence now divergence< divergence is a bullish indication that divergence is a bullish indication that again< again that the market has a higher again that the market has a higher chance< chance of it going up than it going down chance of it going up than it going down so< so there is a confluence so there is a confluence of< of indications that it is going to go up of indications that it is going to go up so< so that is why i decided to sell and in so that is why i decided to sell and in the< the money put the money put because< because i think that the market has a because i think that the market has a good< good chance of it rebounding good chance of it rebounding very< very quickly in the next few days above very quickly in the next few days above right< right so right so what< what exactly is the in the money put so what exactly is the in the money put so let< let me just explain to you what the in let me just explain to you what the in the< the money put it consists of so the money put it consists of so most< most of the time when we sell most of the time when we sell a< a put option most of the time especially a put option most of the time especially when< when you sell and when you sell and out< out of the money put option let's say out of the money put option let's say 280< 280 or even 270 280 or even 270 most< most in fact all of the value is most in fact all of the value is actually< actually extrinsic value actually extrinsic value extrinsic< extrinsic value basically is just time extrinsic value basically is just time value< value and that means that it will decay value and that means that it will decay all< all the way to 0 on expiration date but all the way to 0 on expiration date but with< with a 65 delta put option you notice with a 65 delta put option you notice there< there is a mix of there is a mix of extrinsic< extrinsic value extrinsic value as< as well as intrinsic value as well as intrinsic value so< so extrinsic value we already know is so extrinsic value we already know is time< time value and it goes to zero the time value and it goes to zero the moment< moment the option expires intrinsic moment the option expires intrinsic value< value on the other hand does not expire value on the other hand does not expire it< it does not go to. zero because of time it does not go to zero because of time intrinsic< intrinsic value is basically just the intrinsic value is basically just the difference< difference between the difference between the current< current stock price and the strike price current stock price and the strike price all< all right so at the point at the point all right so at the point at the point of< of uh of uh when< when i was selling this in the money put when i was selling this in the money put option< option it was 290 dollars all right let option it was 290 dollars all right let me< me just go ahead and remove this me just go ahead and remove this drawings drawings drawings okay< okay so at the point of time okay so at the point of time when< when i was selling this in the money put when i was selling this in the money put option< option the price was at option the price was at 290< 290 dollars 290 dollars okay< okay so okay so when< when i sold the 300 strike price it when i sold the 300 strike price it means< means there is a 10 difference means there is a 10 difference between< between the price between the price that< that i sold that i sold when< when the market price when i sold the when the market price when i sold the put< put option and the strike price so this put option and the strike price so this 10< 10 dollars in intrinsic value is 10 dollars in intrinsic value is basically< basically the difference between this basically the difference between this which< which means to say even if the market which means to say even if the market right< right now let's say on the day itself i right now let's say on the day itself i sold< sold it it was to rally up ten points sold it it was to rally up ten points just< just on the day itself that i bought it just on the day itself that i bought it i< i would have pocketed this full ten i would have pocketed this full ten dollars< dollars this ten dollars in intrinsic dollars this ten dollars in intrinsic value value value would< would become zero dollars would become zero dollars that< that is because intrinsic value is that is because intrinsic value is pretty< pretty much just like buying shares pretty much just like buying shares right< right is the is the capital gains in right is the is the capital gains in terms< terms of the movement terms of the movement now< now of course on the other hand if i was now of course on the other hand if i was if< if the market was to go down ten dollars if the market was to go down ten dollars right< right if the market was to go down ten right if the market was to go down ten dollars dollars dollars what< what do you think would happen to this what do you think would happen to this intrinsic< intrinsic value right this intrinsic intrinsic value right this intrinsic value< value would now become twenty dollars value would now become twenty dollars that< that means i have a loss of ten dollars that means i have a loss of ten dollars because< because i sold it at ten dollars because i sold it at ten dollars and< and when it became 20 if i buy back at and when it became 20 if i buy back at 20 20 20 my< my loss is 10 my loss is 10 which< which is a thousand dollars per contract which is a thousand dollars per contract so so so this< this is what intrinsic value is this is what intrinsic value is intrinsic< intrinsic value is when i expect that intrinsic value is when i expect that the< the the move the the move of< of the stock is going to be uh pretty of the stock is going to be uh pretty quick quick quick that< that is why i decided to sell the in the that is why i decided to sell the in the money< money put as opposed to selling the out money put as opposed to selling the out of< of the money put option okay so if we to of the money put option okay so if we to compare< compare and all the money put option compare and all the money put option or< or even an add the money put option okay or even an add the money put option okay so< so let's just compare let's say if i so let's just compare let's say if i were< were to sell the 290 were to sell the 290 um um um put< put option during that time that is at put option during that time that is at the< the money at the point of time when i the money at the point of time when i saw< saw the 290 strike price saw the 290 strike price the the the um< um premium which they were selling at is um premium which they were selling at is roughly< roughly 15 roughly 15 okay< okay so 15 for an at the money okay so 15 for an at the money put< put option which i received the premium put option which i received the premium if< if i were to sell it that compared to a if i were to sell it that compared to a 20 20 20 a< a premium now the thing with extrinsic a premium now the thing with extrinsic premium< premium or extrinsic value premium or extrinsic value is< is that if even though on the day itself is that if even though on the day itself if< if it was to go up ten dollars if it was to go up ten dollars chances< chances are this fifteen dollars would chances are this fifteen dollars would only< only drop down to roughly maybe twelve only drop down to roughly maybe twelve dollars dollars dollars right right right so< so if it became twelve dollars so if it became twelve dollars my< my profit would only be three dollars my profit would only be three dollars so< so that is roughly three hundred dollars so that is roughly three hundred dollars so< so i made three hundred dollars when the so i made three hundred dollars when the market< market has gone up ten dollars market has gone up ten dollars that< that is the that is the thing< thing with extrinsic value extrinsic thing with extrinsic value extrinsic value< value is only value is only profitable< profitable over time but if there's a profitable over time but if there's a big< big move big move in< in the direction that you want it to go in the direction that you want it to go the< the profit is not going to be that big the profit is not going to be that big compared< compared to intrinsic value so that is compared to intrinsic value so that is why< why i decided to sell this with a good why i decided to sell this with a good mix< mix of mix of 50 50 50 which< which is extrinsic value and 50 in which is extrinsic value and 50 in intrinsic< intrinsic value this way once the market intrinsic value this way once the market goes< goes up here i would immediately make goes up here i would immediately make the< the money on the intrinsic value which the money on the intrinsic value which means< means i already have gotten 50 of the means i already have gotten 50 of the premium premium premium and< and then i would pocket and then i would pocket a< a small portion of this extrinsic value a small portion of this extrinsic value depending< depending on how long it took to get depending on how long it took to get to< to this point right to this point right so< so let's take a look at what happened so let's take a look at what happened in< in the next few days so in the next few days so on< on the 1st of june on the 1st of june which< which is roughly nine days later which is roughly nine days later right< right this is what i saw the market right this is what i saw the market became< became overbought which is pretty quick became overbought which is pretty quick as< as you can see the moment i placed an as you can see the moment i placed an order< order at this point the market dipped order at this point the market dipped down< down a little bit after which it it it down a little bit after which it it it went< went up so it really even past went up so it really even past my< my 300 strike price my 300 strike price so< so at this point because i saw that the so at this point because i saw that the market< market was already overbought and we are market was already overbought and we are after< after all in a bear market the market after all in a bear market the market wants< wants to come down and as you can see wants to come down and as you can see there's< there's a moving average here which there's a moving average here which serves< serves as a dynamic resistance serves as a dynamic resistance i< i wanted to get out of this trade i wanted to get out of this trade okay< okay so that's what i did on the 1st of okay so that's what i did on the 1st of june< june i decided to buy back for 8. 49 june i decided to buy back for 8.

49 so< so this was above the strike price of so this was above the strike price of three< three hundred dollars three hundred dollars above< above three hundred dollars which means above three hundred dollars which means i< i actually gotten the full value i actually gotten the full value of< of the intrinsic value of the intrinsic value this< this ten dollars i pocketed it because this ten dollars i pocketed it because it< it went past this 300 strike price which it went past this 300 strike price which is< is more than ten dollars in intrigues is more than ten dollars in intrigues value< value so this ten dollars value so this ten dollars became< became zero dollars became zero dollars and< and then this ten dollar portion and then this ten dollar portion became< became the eight dollars and forty nine became the eight dollars and forty nine cents< cents which we see cents which we see which< which is the value which i bought it for which is the value which i bought it for so< so what does this mean so what does this mean it< it means that the extrinsic value only it means that the extrinsic value only decayed< decayed roughly how much decayed roughly how much a< a dollar a dollar and< and 51 cents and 51 cents i< i only made a dollar and fifty one cents i only made a dollar and fifty one cents out< out of the ten dollars out of the ten dollars in< in just nine days right why is it so in just nine days. right why is it so little little little and< and the reason is because you can see i and the reason is because you can see i saw< saw the option with 53 days to go and saw the option with 53 days to go and this< this whole trade only took nine days this whole trade only took nine days so< so that is why there isn't that much so that is why there isn't that much extrinsic< extrinsic value that got decayed because extrinsic value that got decayed because extrinsic< extrinsic value again extrinsic value again mostly< mostly decays over time all right mostly decays over time all right there's< there's even though there's even though you< you know if there's a big move all right you know if there's a big move all right there< there will be slightly more decay but there will be slightly more decay but not< not as much as compared to not as much as compared to an< an intrinsic value move an intrinsic value move so< so that is why i decided that on this so that is why i decided that on this day< day it's time for me to close it out and day it's time for me to close it out and then< then take my profits as i saw it is over then take my profits as i saw it is over bought bought bought okay< okay so what is the total profit so the okay so what is the total profit so the total< total profit is 20 total profit is 20 1< 1 cent minus off 8. 49 times 100 shares 1 cent minus off 8.

49 times 100 shares that< that is a thousand hundred and fifty two that is a thousand hundred and fifty two dollars< dollars now i want you to ignore this dollars now i want you to ignore this one< one cent because this one cent is one cent because this one cent is basically< basically given to the broker basically given to the broker right< right the broker charges about right the broker charges about 70< 70 cents per 70 cents per option< option so when i wrote it for twenty option so when i wrote it for twenty dollars< dollars and one cent this gives me two dollars and one cent this gives me two thousand< thousand one dollars thousand one dollars so< so the one dollar is given to the broker so the one dollar is given to the broker okay< okay so this total profit of thousand okay so this total profit of thousand hundred< hundred and fifty two dollars hundred and fifty two dollars the< the duration is nine days and the the duration is nine days and the annualized< annualized roi is where i take the annualized roi is where i take the 152< 152 dollars divided by the cost of the 152 dollars divided by the cost of the option< option if i would to get filled option if i would to get filled and< and then i divide it by nine days times and then i divide it by nine days times 365< now now now the< the important thing when i entered this the important thing when i entered this in< in the money put is that i had the cash in the money put is that i had the cash to< to fulfill to fulfill this< this 300 in case this 300 in case right right right the< the market went down the market went down so< so i was already prepared to get long so i was already prepared to get long if< if for some reason this trade didn't if for some reason this trade didn't work< work out work out so so so here's< here's the the thing here's the the thing after< after that the market did after that the market did go< go sideways and go below where i entered go sideways and go below where i entered so< so as you can see my exit here was a so as you can see my exit here was a pretty< pretty good exit it's pretty much at a pretty good exit it's pretty much at a high< high because i took a look at the high because i took a look at the indicator< indicator and it says overbought let's indicator and it says overbought let's set< set it just get out set it just get out so< so you can see the market just started so you can see the market just started to< to dwindle sideways after. that to dwindle sideways after that now< now what happens if the market didn't go now what happens if the market didn't go up< up but instead it went down where you up but instead it went down where you sold< sold in the money put so you might be sold in the money put so you might be wondering< wondering maybe this is just a lucky wondering maybe this is just a lucky trade< trade and that it just happened to go up trade and that it just happened to go up right< right so this is the thing before i right so this is the thing before i enter< enter any trade and before you enter any enter any trade and before you enter any trade< trade or any investment you need to ask trade or any investment you need to ask yourself yourself yourself a< a few questions the most important thing a few questions the most important thing is< is you want to ask yourself what is the is you want to ask yourself what is the worst< worst case scenario okay you want to be worst case scenario okay you want to be okay< okay with the worst case scenario before okay with the worst case scenario before you< you go ahead with the trade so for me you go ahead with the trade so for me when< when i enter this trade ask myself this when i enter this trade ask myself this the< the worst case scenario the worst case scenario what< what would it be so the worst case what would it be so the worst case scenario< scenario would be i would get assigned scenario would be i would get assigned at< at the 300 level at the 300 level and< and then and then i< i will get to keep the 20 dollars in i will get to keep the 20 dollars in premium< premium which is total of 2001 premium which is total of 2001 so so so would< would i be okay with that and the answer would i be okay with that and the answer is< is of course i would be okay with that is of course i would be okay with that and< and the reason is because you see and the reason is because you see if< if i would get fuel at this price at 300 if i would get fuel at this price at 300 to< to me is it is actually a pretty good to me is it is actually a pretty good price< price for me to enter as an investment price for me to enter as an investment as< as well because qqq's has already as well because qqq's has already dropped< dropped considerably from the highs of dropped considerably from the highs of roughly< roughly 408 dollars and 71 cents right roughly 408 dollars and 71 cents right from from from 408. 21< 408.

21 it dropped down to 300 408. 21 it dropped down to 300 that< that is roughly a drop that is roughly a drop of< of 27 of 27 right< right the market has dropped 27 and even right the market has dropped 27 and even though< though if the market let's say for though if the market let's say for example example example the< the moment i sold it at this point the the moment i sold it at this point the market< market decides to go down market decides to go down i'm< i'm perfectly fine with holding the i'm perfectly fine with holding the price< price at three hundred dollars because price at three hundred dollars because it< it is a pretty it is a pretty uh< uh decent price for me to enter and at uh decent price for me to enter and at the< the same time qqqs in the long term the same time qqqs in the long term would< would go up so i don't mind holding this would go up so i don't mind holding this even< even as a long-term investment so the even as a long-term investment so the same< same thing for you as well when you same thing for you as well when you enter< enter a trade you want to ask yourself enter a trade you want to ask yourself whether whether whether this< this is something that you can go this is something that you can go through< through in the case of a worst case through in the case of a worst case scenario< scenario okay so let's have some scenario okay so let's have some takeaways< takeaways after we've seen that right so takeaways after we've seen that right so the< the first takeaway is that extrinsic the first takeaway is that extrinsic value< value is essentially time value and time value is essentially time value and time value< value will decay over time at the end of value will decay over time at the end of the< the expiration date it will always the expiration date it will always become< become zero become zero next< next there's intrinsic value and the next there's intrinsic value and the intrinsic< intrinsic value is just basically the intrinsic value is just basically the price< price difference between the stock price price difference between the stock price and< and the strike price and intrinsic value and the strike price and intrinsic value doesn't< doesn't decay so when you're selling an doesn't decay so when you're selling an in< in the money in the money put< put option put option it< it does have this two value the the it does have this two value the the intrinsic< intrinsic value as well the extrinsic intrinsic value as well the extrinsic value< value now you might be wondering if i value now you might be wondering if i wanted< wanted the intrinsic value for my trade wanted the intrinsic value for my trade why< why didn't i just outright just bought why didn't i just outright just bought 100< 100 shares at a price of 190 right and 100 shares at a price of 190 right and that< that is a fair question but the problem that is a fair question but the problem with< with that is that if you were to see the with that is that if you were to see the market< market let me just go back very quickly market let me just go back very quickly to< to the market if you were to just see to the market if you were to just see the< the market down here the market down here the< the market in the end ended up back at the market in the end ended up back at 290< 290 so if i were to just buy down here 290 so if i were to just buy down here 100< 100 shares 100 shares all< all right all right then< then what happened is that at this point then what happened is that at this point of< of time i would still of time i would still not< not exactly make any money right and if not exactly make any money right and if we< we gone up if i were to take profit down we gone up if i were. to take profit down here< here i would only make about here i would only make about a< a hundred a hundred dollars< dollars sorry a ten dollars dollars sorry a ten dollars move move move for< for a hundred shares so that would be a for a hundred shares so that would be a thousand< thousand dollars but i wouldn't be able thousand dollars but i wouldn't be able to< to profit in terms of the extrinsic to profit in terms of the extrinsic value value value now< now the thing is that what if the market now the thing is that what if the market actually< actually went up and down below the actually went up and down below the strike< strike price and it took a long time strike price and it took a long time before< before going back up here again before going back up here again so< so in this case so in this case not< not only do i make money on the not only do i make money on the intrinsic< intrinsic value portion i also make intrinsic value portion i also make money< money on the extrinsic value portion money on the extrinsic value portion because< because some time have already passed if because some time have already passed if you< you were to just hold on to the shares you were to just hold on to the shares and< and you waited all the way until you and you waited all the way until you became< became 310 to sell it sell away your became 310 to sell it sell away your shares< shares you would only make the full shares you would only make the full intrinsic< intrinsic value of 10 intrinsic value of 10 but< but with the in the money put with the but with the in the money put with the extrinsic< extrinsic value you make both ways so extrinsic value you make both ways so that< that is the reason why i decided to sell that is the reason why i decided to sell that< that in the money put that in the money put all< all right so the next takeaway is that all right so the next takeaway is that if< if you expect a movement to the upside if you expect a movement to the upside pretty< pretty quickly pretty soon you can sound pretty quickly pretty soon you can sound in< in the money put option and normally in the money put option and normally it's< it's around 65 deltas where you have 50 it's around 65 deltas where you have 50 in< in extrinsic value and 50 in intrinsic in extrinsic value and 50 in intrinsic value value value and< and finally you want to ask yourself and finally you want to ask yourself this< this question before entering into any this question before entering into any trade< trade or any investment trade or any investment you< you have to ask yourself what is the you have to ask yourself what is the worst< worst scenario that can happen and if worst scenario that can happen and if that< that happens are you okay with it and if that happens are you okay with it and if the< the answer is yes you have the money to the answer is yes you have the money to fulfill< fulfill the obligations in case you get fulfill the obligations in case you get you< you get exercise on your put option you get exercise on your put option then< then there's absolutely no reason why then there's absolutely no reason why you< you shouldn't take the trade all right you shouldn't take the trade all right guys< guys i hope this video has been helpful guys i hope this video has been helpful for< for you if you like this video please for you if you like this video please give< give me a

### The Math of Winning in Options Trading (How Anyone Can Be Profitable Trading Options) [CBg7bRU_oc0]
=======================================================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about the math we're going to be talking about the math of< of winning in options trading so not too of winning in options trading so not too long< long ago I actually came across a video long ago I actually came across a video with< with a similar title but it's more with a similar title but it's more towards< towards outright trading so I wanted to towards outright trading so I wanted to create< create one that was very specific to create one that was very specific to options< options trading and more specifically options trading and more specifically how< how to become profitable when it comes how to become profitable when it comes to< to selling options so the very first to selling options so the very first thing< thing that you want to understand and thing that you want to understand and when< when we are talking about this topic is when we are talking about this topic is the< the casino business model so in case you the casino business model so in case you didn't< didn't already know the casino business didn't already know the casino business model< model is actually a very profitable model is actually a very profitable business< business model they have been designed business model they have been designed in< in a way that they will win in the long in a way that they will win in the long term< term because all their games are rigged term because all their games are rigged in< in their favor right so all their games in their favor right so all their games have< have been rigged in a way whereby they have been rigged in a way whereby they have< have the statistical Edge in the long have the statistical Edge in the long term< term so the reason I want to bring this term so the reason I want to bring this up< up is because we as option Traders we up is because we as option Traders we want< want to run our options Trad business in want to run our options Trad business in a< a very similar fashion where we have the a very similar fashion where we have the edge< edge over the long term so as you can edge over the long term so as you can see< see over here this is a newspaper see over here this is a newspaper clipping< clipping uh that says you know a higher clipping uh that says you know a higher Casino< Casino earnings Drive Marina Bay sense Casino earnings Drive Marina Bay sense Topline< Topline growth for Q4 so in case you Topline growth for Q4 so in case you know< know you're not familiar Marino Bay know you're not familiar Marino Bay sense< sense is a casino in Singapore and they sense is a casino in Singapore and they have< have been very profitable so like I have been very profitable so like I mentioned< mentioned the reason why casinos are mentioned the reason why casinos are very< very profitable is because their games very profitable is because their games have< have already been rigged in their favor have already been rigged in their favor so< so so that in the long term they will so so that in the long term they will always< always win now of course this is if you always win now of course this is if you play< play the casino games according to their play the casino games according to their rules< rules right but there have been people rules right but there have been people you< you know over the years the decades that you know over the years the decades that they< they have found you know certain ways to they have found you know certain ways to overcome< overcome the casino statistical Edge overcome the casino statistical Edge. over< over you so they could win but you over you so they could win but you notice< notice that it's over the short term notice that it's over the short term right< right so for example uh if you play right so for example uh if you play Blackjack< Blackjack that's the cut counting team Blackjack that's the cut counting team right< right there's a very famous movie called right there's a very famous movie called 21< 21 upon about this but the thing is that 21 upon about this but the thing is that according< according to casinos you are cheating according to casinos you are cheating right< right as long as you can find an edge right as long as you can find an edge over< over their Edge so that you win in the over their Edge so that you win in the long< long term they're going to kick you out long term they're going to kick you out they're< they're going to remove you right they're going to remove you right there's< there's also other ways to you know there's also other ways to you know overcome< overcome some of the edges but we're overcome some of the edges but we're we're< we're not going to talk about that we're not going to talk about that instead< instead we're going to be talking about instead we're going to be talking about the< the way that the casino have designed the way that the casino have designed their< their games that they have a edge a their games that they have a edge a statistical< statistical Edge over the long term so statistical Edge over the long term so let's< let's talk about a very very simple let's talk about a very very simple straightforward< straightforward game that everybody can straightforward game that everybody can understand< understand and that is the roulette understand and that is the roulette right< right and let's just talk about winning right and let's just talk about winning the< the Red and the black the Red and the black so< so as you know if you were to place your so as you know if you were to place your bets< bets on either red or black your win the bets on either red or black your win the payout< payout will be just one is to one right payout will be just one is to one right so< so if you bet a dollar you get a dollar so if you bet a dollar you get a dollar back< back so the probability of win that most back so the probability of win that most people< people think is 50% right because red people think is 50% right because red and< and black 50/50 each so in this case and black 50/50 each so in this case based< based on what people think the based on what people think the expectancy< expectancy is actually zero right expectancy is actually zero right because< because if 50% of the time you get red because if 50% of the time you get red you< you get payout in one is to one black you get payout in one is to one black similar< similar same thing you should break even similar same thing you should break even in< in the long term so some people want to in the long term so some people want to rely< rely on their luck to kind of win so rely on their luck to kind of win so this< this is actually not what's going to this is actually not what's going to happen< happen when you play right so the actual happen when you play right so the actual odds< odds when you are playing it you will odds when you are playing it you will notice< notice that although the payout is one notice that although the payout is one is< is to one your probability of win is is to one your probability of win is actually< actually only actually only 48. 6< 48.

6 5% so why is it 48. 6 5% because 48.

6 5% so why is it 48. 6 5% because many< many people forget that there is a zero many people forget that there is a zero and< and by the way this is the European and by the way this is the European Roulette< Roulette so European Roulette there's Roulette so European Roulette there's one< one Z but if you play the American one Z but if you play the American roulette< roulette that's two so the edge of the roulette that's two so the edge of the casino< casino in the American roulette is casino in the American roulette is actually< actually much more pronounced right so actually much more pronounced right so if< if you were to actually see the real if you were to actually see the real expectancy< expectancy of the uh game as a player expectancy of the uh game as a player you< you will see that you actually going to you will see that you actually going to be< be losing in the long term so there is be losing in the long term so there is no< no way that you will actually win in the no way that you will actually win in the long< long term if you play according to the long term if you play according to the casino< casino rules right so that is why the casino rules right so that is why the casino< casino have a very very powerful casino have a very very powerful business< business model that ensures that they're business model that ensures that they're going< going to win in the long term so they're going to win in the long term so they're not< not even concerned about the fact that not even concerned about the fact that you're< you're going to win the first two three you're going to win the first two three four< four five games because they know that four five games because they know that if< if you were to play many many games if if you were to play many many games if you< you were to stay there right and also you were to stay there right and also that's< that's one of the reasons why casinos that's one of the reasons why casinos are< are 24/7 you notice it's open all day are 24/7 you notice it's open all day long< long all night long and there's no long all night long and there's no clocks< clocks in the casino right at least clocks in the casino right at least there< there wasn't any clocks when I went there wasn't any clocks when I went there< there you know some time back and at the there you know some time back and at the same< same time they're going to entice you same time they're going to entice you with< with free food or very cheap food if with free food or very cheap food if you're< you're a member and even give you you you're a member and even give you you know< know free lodging free accommodation at know free lodging free accommodation at their< their hotels or at a very low rate just their hotels or at a very low rate just so< so that you keep staying there and keep so that you keep staying there and keep playing< playing and that is why as you can see playing and that is why as you can see over< over here this newspaper clipping says over here this newspaper clipping says that< that the casino really made a lot right that the casino really made a lot right as< as you can see down here MBS Casino as you can see down here MBS Casino segment< segment has maintained its position as segment has maintained its position as the< the largest revenue contributor for the the largest revenue contributor for the quarter< quarter all right so the MBS they have quarter all right so the MBS they have other< other business revenues but casino is other business revenues but casino is the< the main one because that's the one the main one because that's the one where< where they really make a lot right so where they really make a lot right so when< when we come into options trading it's when we come into options trading it's going< going to be very similar so there are going to be very similar so there are few< few important elements to understand few important elements to understand when< when it comes to options trading so that when it comes to options trading so that it< it works out for you in the long term it works out for you in the long term that< that you're going to be profitable so that you're going to be profitable so the< the first and most talked about element the first and most talked about element is< is What's called the probability of is What's called the probability of profit< profit also known as your win rate so profit also known as your win rate so whenever< whenever we construct any option whenever we construct any option strategy< strategy we will know the rough strategy we will know the rough probability< probability of profit right the win rate probability of profit right the win rate so< so this is not the same for outright so this is not the same for outright trading< trading because if you trade outright trading because if you trade outright trading< trading there's no way for you to know trading there's no way for you to know what's< what's the real win rate about it right what's the real win rate about it right but< but when it comes to options we already but when it comes to options we already know< know just based on the mathematical know just based on the mathematical formula< formula what is the theoretical win rate formula what is the theoretical win rate right< right so as you can see over here this right so as you can see over here this is< is of the 20 Delta buut spread and you is of the 20 Delta buut spread and you can< can see that just from here it says that can see that just from here it says that the< the win rate is roughly about 80% but the win rate is roughly about 80% but when< when it comes to options trading you when it comes to options trading you need< need to understand that the pop right need to understand that the pop right the< the probability of profit shown on your the probability of profit shown on your p&amp;l< p&amp;l graph is actually theoretical that p&amp;l graph is actually theoretical that means< means to say that it's not necessarily means to say that it's not necessarily the< the actual win rate when you actually the actual win rate when you actually place< place the trade so it can defer in place the trade so it can defer in reality< reality if you trade options that are 45 reality if you trade options that are 45 DTE< DTE and above and as you can see over DTE and above and as you can see over here< here this is a study that I've shown here this is a study that I've shown quite< quite a bit over a number of my videos quite a bit over a number of my videos and< and a very important one this is why we and a very important one this is why we as< as a option seller have an edge when we as a option seller have an edge when we trade< trade options so you can see this is a trade options so you can see this is a study< study that's done on spy where they study that's done on spy where they measure< measure the expected move which is the measure the expected move which is the theoretical< theoretical uh win rate based on what's theoretical. uh win rate based on what's shown< shown over here and they compare it to shown over here and they compare it to the< the actual realized move that means the the actual realized move that means the actual< actual movement in the market so this is actual movement in the market so this is the< the comparison between the theory versus the comparison between the theory versus practical< practical that means the expected versus practical that means the expected versus realized< realized and as you can see over here realized and as you can see over here when< when they go for the days anything when they go for the days anything that's< that's under 45 days what they realize that's under 45 days what they realize is< is that the expected move whether is it is that the expected move whether is it bigger< bigger than the realized move it's not bigger than the realized move it's not which< which means to say it's roughly about which means to say it's roughly about the< the same right you can see over here the same right you can see over here based< based on the based on the percentages< percentages they're pretty much the same percentages they're pretty much the same so< so anything that's under 45 days what so anything that's under 45 days what you< you actually see in terms of the you actually see in terms of the theoretical< theoretical wind rate on your pinl graph theoretical wind rate on your pinl graph tends< tends to be pretty accurate but this tends to be pretty accurate but this actually< actually changes once you go for the 45 actually changes once you go for the 45 DTE< DTE and above so as you can see over DTE and above so as you can see over here< here they did the study as well but this here they did the study as well but this time< time for above 45 days and what they time for above 45 days and what they found< found out is that the realized move is found out is that the realized move is actually< actually much smaller than the expected actually much smaller than the expected move< move right or in other words the move right or in other words the expected< expected move is bigger than the expected move is bigger than the realized< realized move so as you can see over realized move so as you can see over here< here in 45 days 60 days and 90 days they here in 45 days 60 days and 90 days they are< are all yes that means the actual move are all yes that means the actual move is< is much much smaller is much much smaller when< when it comes to reality so this is the when it comes to reality so this is the expected< expected move this is based on what the expected move this is based on what the actual< actual theory is saying right maybe actual theory is saying right maybe let's< let's say for example this is the let's say for example this is the distance< distance it moves but in reality this is distance it moves but in reality this is actually< actually the move right this is actually actually the move right this is actually smaller< smaller so why is this important this is smaller so why is this important this is important< important because this is where our Edge important because this is where our Edge lies< lies so if you remember I talked about lies so if you remember I talked about the< the roulette the casino business model the roulette the casino business model in< in terms of their games where they have in terms of their games where they have the< the statistical Edge when it comes to the statistical Edge when it comes to options< options trading this is our stat options trading this is our stat physical< physical Edge right that is why for the physical Edge right that is why for the most< most part most of the strategies that most part most of the strategies that you< you want to trade should be around 45 you want to trade should be around 45 days< days so over here it shows you there are days so over here it shows you there are two< two ways to analyze this expected move two ways to analyze this expected move right< right so expected move can be either right so expected move can be either using< using the expected move formula which using the expected move formula which you< you actually can see on your option you actually can see on your option chain< chain where they actually show you the chain where they actually show you the number< number already and there's the number already and there's the volatility< volatility at the right hand side as volatility at the right hand side as well< well and then the other quick way where well and then the other quick way where you< you can measure the expected move is the you can measure the expected move is the 16< 16 Delta options so let's just take a 16 Delta options so let's just take a look< look at the 16 Delta options by the way look at the 16 Delta options by the way if< if you see down here the numbers I think if you see down here the numbers I think they< they actually swapped that means the they actually swapped that means the expected< expected move numbers should actually expected move numbers should actually belong< belong to this and this should actually belong to this and this should actually belong< belong to this right so that me the win belong to this right so that me the win rate< rate based on 16 Delta should be around rate based on 16 Delta should be around 85%< 85% and expected move should be around 85% and expected move should be around 71%< 71% uh mainly because the 16 Delta 71% uh mainly because the 16 Delta actually< actually tends to be wider the range is actually tends to be wider the range is wider< wider than the actual expected move wider than the actual expected move right< right so I think they kind of got this right so I think they kind of got this to< to mixed up so the important thing down to mixed up so the important thing down here< here to actually see is this number over here to actually see is this number over here< here so you see the X expected here so you see the X expected occurrences< occurrences within range what this means occurrences within range what this means is< is that this is the theory the is that this is the theory the theoretical< theoretical win rate is 68% but in theoretical win rate is 68% but in actual< actual reality is actually higher so actual reality is actually higher so what< what the tasty trade team actually did what the tasty trade team actually did is< is that they went further to actually is that they went further to actually measure< measure this expected Move versus measure this expected Move versus realized< realized move so as you can see over realized move so as you can see over here< here this is for spy the average here this is for spy the average expected< expected move is much bigger than the expected move is much bigger than the average< average realized move right let's take a average realized move right let's take a look< look at the overall so what it means is look at the overall so what it means is this< this so based on the theory right let's this so based on the theory right let's see< see the theory tells you that the range see the theory tells you that the range this< $16.

57 $16. 57 $16.

57 right< right and this is based on let's say 16 right and this is based on let's say 16 Delta< Delta so we go 16 Delta on both sides Delta so we go 16 Delta on both sides and< and we know based on 16 Delta what is and we know based on 16 Delta what is the< the theoretical win rate the theoretical the theoretical win rate the theoretical win< win. rate is 68% so inside here would be win rate is 68% so inside here would be about about about 68%< 68% however what they found out is that 68% however what they found out is that the< the actual realiz move is much much the actual realiz move is much much smaller< smaller so the actual realized move is smaller so the actual realized move is only< only about only about $10. 81< $10.

81 right so $10. 81 right so $10.

81< $10. 81 which means to say the actual 16 $10.

81 which means to say the actual 16 Delta< Delta is over here so if this is the Delta is over here so if this is the actual< actual 16 Delta that's over here what actual 16 Delta that's over here what about< about this one that is being mentioned about this one that is being mentioned as< as the theoretical expected move which as the theoretical expected move which is< is the theoretical 16 Delta that means is the theoretical 16 Delta that means in< in actual reality this part where they in actual reality this part where they talked< talked about is 16 Delta in reality talked about is 16 Delta in reality should< should be much lower so it should be should be much lower so it should be maybe< maybe let's say as an example around 10 maybe let's say as an example around 10 Delta< Delta and that is why the wind rate now Delta and that is why the wind rate now actually< actually becomes increased so it's no actually becomes increased so it's no longer< longer 68% and in this case it should be longer 68% and in this case it should be roughly< roughly around 80% so this actually roughly around 80% so this actually coincides< coincides with their own findings right coincides with their own findings right you< you can see the actual occurrences you can see the actual occurrences within< within the actually expected move is within the actually expected move is actually< actually around 71 to 85% so the line is actually around 71 to 85% so the line is this< this your win rate is actually going to this your win rate is actually going to be< be higher than what the theory suggests be higher than what the theory suggests if< if you go for the DTE that is 45 and if you go for the DTE that is 45 and above< above okay so this is a very important above okay so this is a very important thing< thing to understand because this is thing to understand because this is where< where again like I mentioned this is where again like I mentioned this is where< where our Edge lies and makes the whole where our Edge lies and makes the whole number< number the math work for us when we are number the math work for us when we are selling< selling options so they actually also selling options so they actually also tested< tested this in QQQ and as you can see tested this in QQQ and as you can see same< same thing average expected move is more same thing average expected move is more than< than the average realized move than the average realized move regardless< regardless of the volatility as well regardless of the volatility as well this< this all is the same same thing with this all is the same same thing with iwm< iwm so for example if you were to just iwm so for example if you were to just put< put up a 20 Delta put spread and you put up a 20 Delta put spread and you were< were to see it in your own option were to see it in your own option platform< platform you will see that the pop platform you will see that the pop should< should be around 80% in theory if you should be around 80% in theory if you hold< hold to exploration right in fact this hold to exploration right in fact this is< is the TC trade. platform if you were to is the TC trade platform if you were to see< see this is based on a 20 Delta and you see this is based on a 20 Delta and you can< can see the pop down here shows 81% so can see the pop down here shows 81% so this< this is the theory this is the theory right< right that means it should wi only about right that means it should wi only about 81%< 81% of the time but when they actually 81% of the time but when they actually place< place the trade out in reality right place the trade out in reality right around< around the 45 DT Mark the actual win around the 45 DT Mark the actual win rate< rate is actually much higher and this is rate is actually much higher and this is at< at around 90% so as you can see this is at around 90% so as you can see this is a< a discrepancy between the theoretical a discrepancy between the theoretical wind< wind rate and the Practical the actual wind rate and the Practical the actual wind< wind rate same thing as well for the wind rate same thing as well for the strangle< strangle right so as you can see we strangle right so as you can see we already< already talked about the strangle already talked about the strangle earlier< earlier so a 16 Delta Le should only earlier so a 16 Delta Le should only have< have a theoretical win rate of 68% right have a theoretical win rate of 68% right held< held to expiration so as you can see held to expiration so as you can see this< this is this is 69%< 69% but in actual reality you will see 69% but in actual reality you will see they< they actually even tested this out right they actually even tested this out right they< they actually put out the trades and they actually put out the trades and show< show that the win rate if hold show that the win rate if hold exploration< exploration is exploration is 84%< 84% this is much much higher than the 84% this is much much higher than the theoretical< theoretical win rate so why is this so theoretical win rate so why is this so same< same thing is because they went for the same thing is because they went for the 45< 45 DT and above and this has also been 45 DT and above and this has also been shown< shown in my own actual trades by the way shown in my own actual trades by the way if< if you like this video so far Please if you like this video so far Please Subscribe< Subscribe and also click the thumbs up Subscribe and also click the thumbs up button< button

com blueprint over to options with davis.

com blueprint all< all right back to the video so all those all right back to the video so all those are< are just in theory and in their testing are just in theory and in their testing but< but these are actual live trades so in but these are actual live trades so in my< my actual live trades right over the my actual live trades right over the past< past 100 trades you can see that the win past 100 trades you can see that the win rate< rate is 77% and this again is based on rate is 77% and this again is based on the< the 16 Delta strangle so Theory tells me the 16 Delta strangle so Theory tells me that< that it's supposed to be 68% but in that it's supposed to be 68% but in actual< actual fact I'm getting 77% and that is actual fact I'm getting 77% and that is also< also the reason why a number of you may also the reason why a number of you may have< have tried to actually calculate the have tried to actually calculate the expectancy< expectancy based on what's actually expectancy based on what's actually given< given on the actual option chain itself given on the actual option chain itself right< right so let's take a look at this one right so let's take a look at this one down< down here if you were to calculate this down here if you were to calculate this over< over here just based on the simple over here just based on the simple expectancy< expectancy on of whatever they are expectancy on of whatever they are giving< giving you as the win rate you'll find giving you as the win rate you'll find that< that it turns out to be a negative right that it turns out to be a negative right so< so expectancy is a very important part so expectancy is a very important part of< of how we're going to calculate our of how we're going to calculate our profitability< profitability of any strategy which I'll profitability of any strategy which I'll get< get into later but if you have been get into later but if you have been doing< doing this already and you find out this doing this already and you find out this doesn't< doesn't work is basically because the doesn't work is basically because the difference< difference between Theory and practical difference between Theory and practical if< if you were to take the Practical win if you were to take the Practical win rate< rate and you were to calculate this now rate and you were to calculate this now you< you will see that the numbers now work you will see that the numbers now work so< so generally with option selling so generally with option selling strategies< strategies we have a high win rate right strategies we have a high win rate right but< but the there's always a trade-off right but the there's always a trade-off right we< we have a high win rate but the we have a high win rate but the trade-off< trade-off is that there is a low risk to trade-off is that there is a low risk to reward< reward ratio so maybe we are risking reward ratio so maybe we are risking something< something like $4 to make a dollar or something like $4 to make a dollar or maybe< maybe risk5 $6 just to make a dollar and maybe risk5 $6 just to make a dollar and on< on the other hand with options buying on the other hand with options buying strategy< strategy we have a low win rate but the strategy we have a low win rate but the trade-off< trade-off is a high risk rate ratio now trade-off is a high risk rate ratio now that< that is not to say that one is that is not to say that one is necessarily< necessarily better than the other right necessarily better than the other right at< at the end of the day both can still be at the end of the day both can still be profitable< profitable really depending on how you profitable really depending on how you trade< trade it so let us just assume that both trade it so let us just assume that both are< are profitable now if both are are profitable now if both are profitable< profitable they both make the same money profitable they both make the same money at< at the end of let's say 10 trades at the end of let's say 10 trades there's< there's going to be an edge with one there's going to be an edge with one strategy< strategy over the other right so let's strategy over the other right so let's take< take a look at both of them and compare take a look at both of them and compare so< so the first one is on a debit spread so the first one is on a debit spread where< where your win rate is about 50% and at where your win rate is about 50% and at the< the end of the day you get you know the end of the day you get you know 1,000< 1,000 profit now the credit spread is a 1,000 profit now the credit spread is a higher< higher win rate right but of course higher win rate right but of course you're< you're going to have a much bigger loss you're going to have a much bigger loss when< when you lose but let's say at the end when you lose but let's say at the end of< of of day it's also at ,000 profit so if of of day it's also at ,000 profit so if both< both strategies at the end of 10 trades both strategies at the end of 10 trades both< both yield the same profit which one both yield the same profit which one would< would you choose well most likely the would you choose well most likely the credit< credit spread will be a much easier credit spread will be a much easier trade< trade to put on why it's because of the trade to put on why it's because of the psychology< psychology that we humans go through psychology that we humans go through imagine< imagine this when you put on the trade imagine this when you put on the trade and< and then you have the first one is a win and then you have the first one is a win but< but then you have four losses in a row but then you have four losses in a row how< how many of you can actually withstand how many of you can actually withstand four< four losses in a row I know of many four losses in a row I know of many Traders< Traders that have actually spoken with Traders that have actually spoken with me< me that even after two three trades they me that even after two three trades they start< start to get very fearful and they don't start to get very fearful and they don't want< want to put on the next trade right want to put on the next trade right whereas< whereas for the credit spread slightly whereas for the credit spread slightly different< different you're going to have more different you're going to have more winners< winners in a row and your losing streaks winners in a row and your losing streaks is< is not going to be that high right so is not going to be that high right so that< that is why when you compare both of that is why when you compare both of them< them you will find that it's much easier them you will find that it's much easier to< to put on the credit spread compared to to put on the credit spread compared to the< the debit spread so I'm comparing the debit spread so I'm comparing selling< selling options versus buying options so selling options versus buying options so psychology< psychology is one thing that many people psychology is one thing that many people actually< actually do not put into consideration actually do not put into consideration when< when they are trading but when they when they are trading but when they start< start to go through losses this is where start to go through losses this is where they< they start to fearful and they start to they start to fearful and they start to be< be afraid to put on the next trade so be afraid to put on the next trade so there< there are some very big misconception there are some very big misconception when< when it comes to options trading so many when it comes to options trading so many people< people think that having a high win rate people think that having a high win rate strategy< strategy is going to make an option strategy is going to make an option strategy< strategy profitable no that is not the strategy profitable no that is not the case< case right High win rate just helps us case right High win rate just helps us with< with our mindset right but it doesn't with our mindset right but it doesn't necessarily< necessarily mean that it can be necessarily mean that it can be profitable< profitable it really depends on how you profitable it really depends on how you craft< craft the strategy how you trade it now craft the strategy how you trade it now on< on the other hand some people think that on the other hand some people think that a< a high win R strategy will have one loss a high win R strategy will have one loss that< that will wipe out the entire account that will wipe out the entire account now< now that is not necessarily true as well now that is not necessarily true as well it< it again depends on what is the strategy it again depends on what is the strategy you< you put on how you construct it and how you put on how you construct it and how you< you actually trade it so yes it's true you actually trade it so yes it's true that< that some people that actually have that some people that actually have their< their whole account wiped out because their whole account wiped out because they< they have a very high win rate strategy they have a very high win rate strategy but< but that is not necessarily the case for but that is not necessarily the case for all< all the types of strategy because all the types of strategy because there's< there's many different ways that you can there's many different ways that you can actually< actually trade a high win rate strategy actually trade a high win rate strategy right< right for example this strategy over right for example this strategy over here< here is based off a 90% win rate here is based off a 90% win rate strategy< strategy and already there have been strategy and already there have been quite< quite a number of losses that are quite quite a number of losses that are quite big< big so again when we are trading this big so again when we are trading this option< option selling strategies the higher the option selling strategies the higher the win< win rate usually there'll be the higher win rate usually there'll be the higher the< the losses right but that does not mean the losses right but that does not mean that< that it's going to wipe out your account that it's going to wipe out your account if< if you know how to trade it properly so if you know how to trade it properly so as< as you can see down here the equity as you can see down here the equity curve< curve for this strategy is actually curve for this strategy is actually pretty< pretty good so the most important thing pretty good so the most important thing or< or takeway you want to have for this or takeway you want to have for this probability< probability profit is this that the pop probability profit is this that the pop alone< alone is meaningless and not enough to alone is meaningless and not enough to determine< determine whether a strategy is determine whether a strategy is profitable< profitable or not in the long term right profitable or not in the long term right so< so the pop only helps with the so the pop only helps with the psychology< psychology whether it's profit or not psychology whether it's profit or not comes< comes down to next important element comes down to next important element which< which is the average profit or loss which is the average profit or loss which< which means to say how much on average which means to say how much on average you< you make when the trade is a winner and you make when the trade is a winner and how< how much on average you lose when the how much on average you lose when the trade< trade is a loser so to have a proper trade is a loser so to have a proper understanding< understanding on the profitability of understanding on the profitability of the< the option strategy you're trading you the option strategy you're trading you need< need to know the average profit and loss need to know the average profit and loss so< so this is where you can start to so this is where you can start to calculate< calculate the expectancy so remember calculate the expectancy so remember earlier< earlier on we talked about expectancy so earlier on we talked about expectancy so expectancy< expectancy the calculation is actually expectancy the calculation is actually pretty< pretty simple right basically it's the pretty simple right basically it's the probability< probability of the profit that means probability of the profit that means your< your win rate times the average profit your win rate times the average profit minus< minus the probability of loss which is minus the probability of loss which is your< your losing rate and you multiply that your losing rate and you multiply that by< by your average loss so for example by your average loss so for example let's< let's say your probability of profit is let's say your probability of profit is 77%< 77% your probability of losing is 23% 77% your probability of losing is 23% your< your average profit is your average profit is $269< $269 your average loss is $269 your average loss is $23< $23 so with this we can actually $23 so with this we can actually calculate< calculate our expectancy which comes out calculate our expectancy which comes out to< to about to about $160< $160 44 which means to say on average $160 44 which means to say on average every< every time you put on the trade it will every time you put on the trade it will be< be a profit of $1 be a profit of $1 16044< 16044 and this is not just some numbers 16044 and this is not just some numbers that< that I plucked out of the air right this that I plucked out of the air right this are< are actual trade numbers that from my are actual trade numbers that from my own< own actual trades so as you can see over own actual trades so as you can see over here< here this is of the last 100 trades of a here this is of the last 100 trades of a strategy< strategy that has a win rate of strategy that has a win rate of 77%< 77% right again this is of the strangle 77% right again this is of the strangle so< so 16 Delta strangle based on Theory so 16 Delta strangle based on Theory should< should be 68% but it's coming out with a should be 68% but it's coming out with a 77%< 77% so again this is the difference 77% so again this is the difference between< between your theory and your practical between your theory and your practical now< now at this point you might be asking me now at this point you might be asking me this< this and I've had people that ask me this and I've had people that ask me this< this as well before but Davis I put on a this as well before but Davis I put on a 70%< 70% win rate strategy and my first four 70% win rate strategy and my first four trades< trades are losses this shouldn't be trades are losses this shouldn't be happening< happening what's going on so this is happening what's going on so this is where< where you need to truly understand where you need to truly understand losing< losing streaks and more specifically the losing streaks and more specifically the probability< probability of losing streaks so as you probability of losing streaks so as you can< can see over here this is a probability can see over here this is a probability table< table of showing what is the chances table of showing what is the chances right< right or probability of having X number right or probability of having X number of< of consecutive losing trades within a of consecutive losing trades within a 100< 100 Trade sequence that means to say if 100 Trade sequence that means to say if you< you put on a trade or the strategy for a you put on a trade or the strategy for a 100< 100 trades this is the probability of 100 trades this is the probability of the< the number of losers that can happen so the number of losers that can happen so let's< let's just say let's take a look at the let's just say let's take a look at the 70%< 70% win rate strategy so the person 70% win rate strategy so the person mentioned< mentioned that you know there are four mentioned that you know there are four losses< losses in a r this shouldn't be losses in a r this shouldn't be happening< happening well let's really examine happening well let's really examine based< based on probability can this actually based on probability can this actually happen< happen so if you will take a look at happen so if you will take a look at this< this over here four losses in a row you this over here four losses in a row you will< will see that over here there is will see that over here there is actually< actually a 55% chance that you can actually a 55% chance that you can actually< actually lose four times in a row as you actually lose four times in a row as you can< can see this is actually better than a can see this is actually better than a coin< coin flip probability which means to say coin flip probability which means to say it's< it's very very probable right you can it's very very probable right you can even< even have a five losing streak in a row even have a five losing streak in a row at< at 21% chance right even six losses in a at 21% chance right even six losses in a row< row 7% now 7% and below this is very row 7% now 7% and below this is very improbable< improbable yes we know that the improbable yes we know that the percentage< percentage is low but does this mean percentage is low but does this mean that< that it's impossible that you're not that it's impossible that you're not ever< ever going to have six losses in a row ever going to have six losses in a row definitely< definitely not right 7% just means that definitely not right 7% just means that there's< there's a very low chance but it can there's a very low chance but it can happen< happen if you trade long enough so if happen if you trade long enough so if you< you were to trade such strategies with a you were to trade such strategies with a 70%< 70% win rate don't go thinking that you 70% win rate don't go thinking that you know< know there's no way you're going to lose know there's no way you're going to lose five< five or six losses in a row because five or six losses in a row because probability< probability already depicts that it can probability already depicts that it can actually< actually happen and in fact this six actually happen and in fact this six losses< losses in a row has actually happened to losses in a row has actually happened to me< me before right as you can see over here me before right as you can see over here this< this is the same 100 trades which I this is the same 100 trades which I showed< showed you earlier where the overall showed you earlier where the overall expectancy< expectancy is a positive and we in fact expectancy is a positive and we in fact have< have 77% win rate but you can see over have 77% win rate but you can see over here< here I suffered six losses in a row so here I suffered six losses in a row so how< how many of you can actually sit through how many of you can actually sit through the< the six losses in a row a number of you the six losses in a row a number of you may< may just say hit after three trades I'm may just say hit after three trades I'm going< going to stop four trades no way am I going to stop four trades no way am I going< going to continue this strategy it going to continue this strategy it doesn't< doesn't work but if you are going to doesn't work but if you are going to stop< stop there then you're going to miss up stop there then you're going to miss up on< on all the other trades that would have on all the other trades that would have eventually< eventually put the trade into a positive eventually put the trade into a positive so< so that is why it's very important to so that is why it's very important to understand< understand about the probability of understand about the probability of losing< losing streaks now at this point you losing streaks now at this point you might< might also be asking but Davis after 10 might also be. asking but Davis after 10 trades< trades I'm still overall in a loss is trades I'm still overall in a loss is the< the strategy no longer working right the strategy no longer working right I've< I've had one or two people have actually I've had one or two people have actually reached< reached out to me say that Davis I tried reached out to me say that Davis I tried some< some of your strategies that you shared some of your strategies that you shared on< on YouTube I put on three trades five on YouTube I put on three trades five trades< trades and overall I'm still a loss trades and overall I'm still a loss what's< what's going on right so you need to what's going on right so you need to understand< understand the next very important understand the next very important concept< concept if you want to be able to be concept if you want to be able to be profitable< profitable for the long term and that is profitable for the long term and that is the< the law of large numbers the law of the law of large numbers the law of large< large numbers is a very important large numbers is a very important concept< concept when it comes to trading of any concept when it comes to trading of any type< type right so for probabilities to play type right so for probabilities to play out< out you need to understand the law of out you need to understand the law of large< large numbers for example if you flip an large numbers for example if you flip an unbiased< unbiased coin just five times is it unbiased coin just five times is it possible< possible to get hits or tails five times possible to get hits or tails five times well< well I've actually tried it out on a well I've actually tried it out on a random< random number generator online and you random number generator online and you can< can do this as well and it's definitely can do this as well and it's definitely possible< possible so as you can see over here possible so as you can see over here this< this is one of those uh website where this is one of those uh website where just< just does this coin flip simulator and just does this coin flip simulator and just< just the first few tries I was already just the first few tries I was already able< able to get five hits in a row but does able to get five hits in a row but does this< this mean that the probability of this mean that the probability of getting< getting hits is 100% on an unbiased coin getting hits is 100% on an unbiased coin well< well the answer is of course not what if well the answer is of course not what if you< you flip the unbiased coin a 100 times you flip the unbiased coin a 100 times is< is it then possible to get it all hits is it then possible to get it all hits or< or tails well I've tried it as well the or tails well I've tried it as well the answer< answer is extremely unlikely in fact answer is extremely unlikely in fact I've< I've tried this so many times that I I've tried this so many times that I cannot< cannot even get once that is even close cannot even get once that is even close to< to a 100 times and you can do this on to a 100 times and you can do this on your< your own as well just go to Google your own as well just go to Google search< search for coin flip simulator try it search for coin flip simulator try it for< for yourself so if you were to flip this for yourself so if you were to flip this 100< 100 times you'll find that it's very 100 times you'll find that it's very unlikely< unlikely now what if you flip the unlikely now what if you flip the unbiased< unbiased coin over a thousand times is unbiased coin over a thousand times is it< it then possible to get it all hits of it then possible to get it all hits of Tails< Tails the answer is impossible so as you Tails the answer is impossible so as you can< can see the more flips you do at the end can see the more flips you do at the end of< of the day you're going to get a of the day you're going to get a probability< probability that is going to be very probability that is going to be very very< very close or even exact to the actual very close or even exact to the actual true< true prob probility of the actual coin true prob probility of the actual coin itself< itself right the coin is 50 50% chance itself right the coin is 50 50% chance to< to get hits or tails so what am I trying to get hits or tails so what am I trying to< to see over here so what I'm trying to to see over here so what I'm trying to say< say is that the larger the sample size say is that the larger the sample size the< the more it will reach the true the more it will reach the true probability< probability so for those of you who have probability so for those of you who have tried< tried you know some of the strategies tried you know some of the strategies that< that I put on YouTube you put on five that I put on YouTube you put on five trades< trades 10 trades but overall you're not trades 10 trades but overall you're not profitable< profitable it's only because your sample profitable it's only because your sample size< size is just way too small right you can size is just way too small right you can see< see over here the coin flip the smaller see over here the coin flip the smaller your< your sample size the smaller the number your sample size the smaller the number of< of flips the chances of you actually of flips the chances of you actually getting< getting a very skew rate probability of getting a very skew rate probability of getting< getting hits or tail is very high right getting hits or tail is very high right you< you could get 80% of the chance 70% of you could get 80% of the chance 70% of the< the time either heads or tail but once the time either heads or tail but once you< you start to flip them many many times you start to flip them many many times you< you notice that the true probability you notice that the true probability actually< actually starts to show up and this is actually starts to show up and this is the< the same for options trading as well as the same for options trading as well as you< you can see over here this is a study you can see over here this is a study done< done by the tasty trade team and they done by the tasty trade team and they say< say that increasing sample size makes say that increasing sample size makes the< the win rate or realize probably your the win rate or realize probably your profit< profit more consistent over long periods profit more consistent over long periods of< of time so same thing as well if you of time so same thing as well if you take< take a look at this table on the left take a look at this table on the left hand< hand side you can see that the swing is hand side you can see that the swing is very< very erratic right it can go from 100% very erratic right it can go from 100% all< all the way down to about 55% so this is all the way down to about 55% so this is based< based off a 80% win rate strategy so if based off a 80% win rate strategy so if you< you were to put on this trade for maybe you were to put on this trade for maybe just< just 10 times you could see right maybe just 10 times you could see right maybe only< only 55% win rate if you're very unlucky only 55% win rate if you're very unlucky on< on the other hand you could be 100% win on the other hand you could be 100% win rate< rate but this does not show that this rate but this does not show that this this< this is the true probability you need this is the true probability you need more< more trades to put in so as you can see more trades to put in so as you can see over< over here same thing as well in my own over here same thing as well in my own trading< trading if you were to just focus in on trading if you were to just focus in on the< the first 10 trades over here so let's the first 10 trades over here so let's just< just box out the first 10 trades at the just box out the first 10 trades at the end< end of the day it could be actually a end of the day it could be actually a break< break given or maybe even a slight loss break given or maybe even a slight loss right< right but does this mean that the whole right but does this mean that the whole strategy< strategy doesn't work definitely not strategy doesn't work definitely not same< same thing over here what if you were same thing over here what if you were really< really unlucky and your first 10 trades really unlucky and your first 10 trades is< is where the very first six losses in a is where the very first six losses in a row< row happen then guess what you're going row happen then guess what you're going to< to think that this is a very crap to think that this is a very crap strategy< strategy and you're going to start to strategy and you're going to start to make< make a lot of noise right but the truth make a lot of noise right but the truth is< is that once you start to place more is that once you start to place more trades< trades this is where the probability and trades this is where the probability and the< the edge of your strategy will the edge of your strategy will eventually< eventually play out so here's the key to eventually play out so here's the key to long-term< long-term profitability in options long-term profitability in options trading< trading so first of all we do want a trading so first of all we do want a reasonably< reasonably High win rate option selling reasonably High win rate option selling strategy< strategy why because this actually strategy why because this actually benefits< benefits your psychology with shorter benefits your psychology with shorter losing< losing streaks a lot of time many people losing streaks a lot of time many people underestimate< underestimate this they get very fearful underestimate this they get very fearful just< just from the big losses but if your just from the big losses but if your numbers< numbers work out like I mentioned if you numbers work out like I mentioned if you use< use the edge whereby the expected move use the edge whereby the expected move is< is most often the time more than the is most often the time more than the realized< realized move then this is where you can realized move then this is where you can have< have the numbers play out for you in the have the numbers play out for you in the long< long term even though you're going to long term even though you're going to have< have some big losses right those big have some big losses right those big losses< losses compared to your small wins is losses compared to your small wins is just< just normal right but if the numbers just normal right but if the numbers work< work out you can still win in the long work out you can still win in the long term< term but the more important thing term but the more important thing regarding< regarding this High win rate is because regarding this High win rate is because of< of your psychology if you were to go for of your psychology if you were to go for a< a lower win rate strategy like maybe the a lower win rate strategy like maybe the debit< debit spread with of 50% if you reach a debit spread with of 50% if you reach a point< point where you have six losses in a row point where you have six losses in a row and< and the probability table the and the probability table the probability< probability of losses table have already probability of losses table have already shown< shown that it's very possible Right take shown that it's very possible Right take a< a look at 50% you can see that there is a look at 50% you can see that there is a< a very good chance or rather a 52% a very good chance or rather a 52% chance< chance coin flip chance of getting seven chance coin flip chance of getting seven losses< losses in a losses in a how< how many of you can actually sit through how many of you can actually sit through this< this draw down many people would after this draw down many people would after four< four losses or five losses they're just four losses or five losses they're just going< going to throw in the towel and stop going to throw in the towel and stop trading< trading it so that is why having a high trading it so that is why having a high win< win rate is important for our psychology win rate is important for our psychology to< to continue putting on the trade to to continue putting on the trade to eventually< eventually Let The Edge play out in the eventually Let The Edge play out in the long< long term number two risk reward ratio long term number two risk reward ratio is< is not as important as the average is not as important as the average profit< profit and loss that makes the profit and loss that makes the expectancy< expectancy work because when we are expectancy work because when we are trading< trading options it's not all the time trading options it's not all the time you're< you're going to hold to expiration in you're going to hold to expiration in fact< fact I've shown in quite a number of uh fact I've shown in quite a number of uh my< my other videos that we want to get out my other videos that we want to get out latest< latest at 21 DTE so when you exit latest at 21 DTE so when you exit earlier< earlier than what the expiration earlier than what the expiration suggests< suggests then you're not going to suggests then you're not going to actually< actually realize the max profit or the actually realize the max profit or the max< max loss it's going to be somewhere in max loss it's going to be somewhere in between< between so this is where the average between so this is where the average profit< profit and loss comes in next you also profit and loss comes in next you also need< need a very firm understanding that need a very firm understanding that losses< losses are inevitable so I cannot losses are inevitable so I cannot emphasize< emphasize this enough because a lot of emphasize this enough because a lot of time< time many people people put on trades to time many people people put on trades to avoid< avoid losses so probability alone avoid losses so probability alone already< already tells you that you can lose one already tells you that you can lose one time< time or another right you trade long time or another right you trade long enough< enough losses will come even if you have enough losses will come even if you have a< a high rate strategy like 80% or 90% a high rate strategy like 80% or 90% there's< there's still a 10 or 20% chance that's there's still a 10 or 20% chance that's going< going to be a loss so when the loss come going to be a loss so when the loss come just< just take it also draw Downs are just take it also draw Downs are expected< expected that means you could suffer a expected that means you could suffer a period< period of time that you could be still period of time that you could be still in< in the negative right for example if the in the negative right for example if the first< first 10 trades overall going to be a first 10 trades overall going to be a loss< loss that's a draw down but again this loss that's a draw down but again this is< is where you need to continue to put on is where you need to continue to put on the< the trades so that over time you're the trades so that over time you're going< going to let the numbers play out the going to let the numbers play out the probies< probies play out your Edge play out and probies play out your Edge play out and take< take things back to the positive again take things back to the positive again and< and losing streaks will happen so that and losing streaks will happen so that is< is why this again ties back to a high is why this again ties back to a high win< win rate if you have a higher win rate win rate if you have a higher win rate your< your losing streaks is not going to be your losing streaks is not going to be that< that long drawn out but with that said that long drawn out but with that said that's< that's still going to be a losing Stak that's still going to be a losing Stak so< so for example you saw in the so for example you saw in the spreadsheet< spreadsheet I shown you earlier six spreadsheet I shown you earlier six losses< losses in a row can happen again losses in a row can happen again depending< depending on the probability of the depending on the probability of the strategy< strategy that you're trading so that is strategy that you're trading so that is why< why proper risk and money management is why proper risk and money management is very< very important to ensure you're still in very important to ensure you're still in the< the game even after going through losses the game even after going through losses draw< draw downs and losing streaks so proper draw downs and losing streaks so proper risk< risk and money management just basically risk and money management just basically comes< comes down to proper position sizing comes down to proper position sizing that< that means the risk that you put on per that means the risk that you put on per trade< trade and also how much of your total trade and also how much of your total Capital< Capital you're going to risk at any Capital you're going to risk at any single< single time so when you have this two single time so when you have this two correctly< correctly and you you don't over correctly and you you don't over leverage< leverage to the point where you're using leverage to the point where you're using the< the whole capital in your account then the whole capital in your account then you< you never get into a point whereby you never get into a point whereby single< single trade will wipe out your entire single trade will wipe out your entire account< account and finally let the edge work account and finally let the edge work out< out over the long term through the law out over the long term through the law of< of large numbers if you're still not of large numbers if you're still not getting< getting the results that you think you getting the results that you think you should< should be getting or an overall positive should be getting or an overall positive take< take a look at how many trades you take a look at how many trades you actually< actually put on right generally for any actually put on right generally for any proper< proper expectancy to really show it's uh proper expectancy to really show it's uh true< true kind of profitability at least a true kind of profitability at least a 100< 100 trades so you definitely want to 100 trades so you definitely want to focus< focus at least on the next 100 trades focus at least on the next 100 trades rather< rather than just the next 10 to 20 rather than just the next 10 to 20 trades< trades or so when you put all this trades or so when you put all this together< together then this is how you can be together then this is how you can be profitable< profitable in the long term when you profitable in the long term when you selling< selling options by the way if you like selling options by the way if you like this< this video then you're absolutely going this video then you're absolutely going to< to love this next video which I have for to love

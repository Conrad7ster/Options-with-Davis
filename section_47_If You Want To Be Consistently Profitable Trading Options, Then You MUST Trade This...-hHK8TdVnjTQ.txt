Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we< we are gonna be talking about cash we are gonna be talking about cash settle< settle index options what are they and settle index options what are they and more< more importantly how do you treat them more importantly how do you treat them profitably< profitably and also why I think this is profitably and also why I think this is a< a very good way for you to get started a very good way for you to get started in< in trading options right if you're in trading options right if you're relatively< relatively new or you've been trading relatively new or you've been trading for< for under a year all right so let's Dive for under a year all right so let's Dive Right< Right In so first off what exactly are Right In so first off what exactly are cash< cash shuttle index options so as the cash shuttle index options so as the name< name suggests cash shuttle index options name suggests cash shuttle index options are< are options that are only settled in are options that are only settled in cash< cash and not shares all right so let me cash and not shares all right so let me just< just give you an example down here so just give you an example down here so for< for example let's say you sold a shot for example let's say you sold a shot put< put on XSP so if you're not familiar put on XSP so if you're not familiar with< with what XSP is it's just basically the with what XSP is it's just basically the Mini< Mini version of the SPX right so SPX is Mini version of the SPX right so SPX is the< the S P 500 Index option so XSP is the the S P 500 Index option so XSP is the Mini< Mini version which is about one tenth Mini version which is about one tenth this< this size right so let's say you sold a this size right so let's say you sold a shot< shot put at about 440 dollars down here shot put at about 440 dollars down here the< the strike price and you receive a the strike price and you receive a credit< credit of four dollars all right so then credit of four dollars all right so then let's< let's say at expiration XSP went below let's say at expiration XSP went below 440< 440 so right now your shot put is in the 440 so right now your shot put is in the money< money and your shot put is now worth money and your shot put is now worth nine< nine dollars right so you sold it for nine dollars right so you sold it for four< four dollars and now it's worth nine four dollars and now it's worth nine dollars< dollars and now it has pretty much dollars and now it has pretty much expired< expired right it's expiration day so at expired right it's expiration day so at this< this point what happens right so if you this point what happens right so if you were< were trading an index ETF right let's were trading an index ETF right let's say< say for example you were trading the say for example you were trading the index< index ETF counterpart the Spy or maybe index ETF counterpart the Spy or maybe even< even the individual stock then what will even the individual stock then what will happen< happen is that you'll actually be happen is that you'll actually be assigned< assigned a hundred shares at four assigned a hundred shares at four hundred< hundred and forty dollars of expiration hundred and forty dollars of expiration right< right basically any uh in the money right basically any uh in the money options< options any short options that's in options any short options that's in money< money and expiration you'll be assigned money and expiration you'll be assigned right< right so in this case you have a shot right so in this case you have a shot put< put you'll be assigned a hundred shares put you'll be assigned a hundred shares so< so if you assign 100 shares that means so if you assign 100 shares that means that< that you have to have a capital of forty that you have to have a capital of forty four< four thousand dollars in this case in a four thousand dollars in this case in a cash< cash account or IRA account or if you cash account or IRA account or if you have< have a margin account then you know have a margin account then you know depending< depending on your margin right for the depending on your margin right for the default< default it's mostly fifty percent so you default it's mostly fifty percent so you you< you need about twenty two thousand you need about twenty two thousand dollars< dollars to fulfill the obligations of dollars to fulfill the obligations of this< this 100 shares and what happens is that this 100 shares and what happens is that if< if you do not have the funds for this if you do not have the funds for this 100< 100 shares then guess what you're gonna 100 shares then guess what you're gonna get< get Margin Call the broker is going to get Margin Call the broker is going to call< call you ask you to top up your account call you ask you to top up your account now< now what if this was actually a cash now what if this was actually a cash shuttle< shuttle index option right so in this shuttle index option right so in this case< case XSP so in this case at expiration case XSP so in this case at expiration even< even though if it's in the money what even though if it's in the money what happens< happens is that you actually no longer happens is that you actually no longer have< have any position and you'll just simply have any position and you'll just simply realize< realize any profit or loss at the point realize any profit or loss at the point right< right so if it's in the money most right so if it's in the money most likely< likely you've already lost money right likely you've already lost money right if< if it's a greater than the credit which if it's a greater than the credit which you< you receive you receive so< so in this case because you sold it at so in this case because you sold it at four< four dollars and then at expiration it's four dollars and then at expiration it's nine< nine dollars so the difference is nine dollars so the difference is actually< actually five dollars right so basically actually five dollars right so basically you< you are being credited four dollars into you are being credited four dollars into your< your account which is 400 but then you your account which is 400 but then you have< have to pay out nine hundred dollars so have to pay out nine hundred dollars so the< the net is a loss of five hundred the net is a loss of five hundred dollars< dollars so instead of actually getting dollars so instead of actually getting shares< shares into your trading account what shares into your trading account what you'll< you'll just see is that it settled all you'll just see is that it settled all in< in cash right so your trading account in cash right so your trading account let's< let's say if you started off with say let's say if you started off with say twenty< twenty thousand dollars then if this is twenty thousand dollars then if this is the< the only position that you put on then the only position that you put on then your< your loss is 500 you end up with your loss is 500 you end up with nineteen< nineteen thousand five hundred dollars nineteen thousand five hundred dollars so< so as you can see it's pretty so as you can see it's pretty straightforward< straightforward and you don't have all straightforward and you don't have all the< the messiness of getting assigned so the messiness of getting assigned so that< that is why you know if you're afraid of that is why you know if you're afraid of getting< getting a sign or you don't want to have getting a sign or you don't want to have to< to deal with unwinding your shares then to deal with unwinding your shares then the< the better option to trade would be to the better option to trade would be to trade< trade a cash Shadow index options right trade a cash Shadow index options right rather< rather than individual stocks or index rather than individual stocks or index ETFs< ETFs now also cash settle index options ETFs now also cash settle index options are< are European style options so this is a are European style options so this is a term< term that you will come by quite often term that you will come by quite often if< if if you are trading the cash shuttle if if you are trading the cash shuttle index< index option so basically there are two index option so basically there are two types< types right I mentioned this in a number types right I mentioned this in a number of< of my videos before I'll just quickly of my videos before I'll just quickly mention< mention them again so there are two mention them again so there are two types< types right the first type is the types right the first type is the American< American style options those are the American style options those are the ones< ones that you're already very familiar ones that you're already very familiar with< with if you have been trading for some with if you have been trading for some time< time right those are the style options time right those are the style options basically< basically on index ETFs on individual basically on index ETFs on individual stocks< stocks where there is early assignment stocks where there is early assignment that< that means as long as your short options that means as long as your short options are< are in the money the buyer of those are in the money the buyer of those options< options have the right to actually options have the right to actually exercise< exercise those options and you're going exercise those options and you're going to< to get a sign but for European style to get a sign but for European style options< options it can only be assigned at options it can only be assigned at expiration< expiration right so even though if your expiration right so even though if your Sean< Sean options are in the money at any Sean options are in the money at any time< time during you know the duration or time during you know the duration or option< option you don't really have to worry option you don't really have to worry because< because there's no early assignment because there's no early assignment right< right so that's the difference between right so that's the difference between European< European style and American style okay European style and. American style okay so< so that means there is no early so that means there is no early assignment< assignment and you can get only assigned assignment and you can get only assigned at< at expression that means that even if at expression that means that even if your< your options are in the money you can your options are in the money you can choose< choose to hold it to expiration which is choose to hold it to expiration which is pretty< pretty good because quite a number of pretty good because quite a number of people< people actually actually want to hold people actually actually want to hold the< the expression because whenever they're the expression because whenever they're trading< trading any options strategies with the trading any options strategies with the credit< credit spread or the iron Condor all credit spread or the iron Condor all right< right in this case let me just draw the right in this case let me just draw the iron< iron Condor so the iron Condor will look iron Condor so the iron Condor will look something< something like this this is the p l something like this this is the p l graph< graph so this is the zero dollar line so graph so this is the zero dollar line so anything< anything that is above zero dollars is anything that is above zero dollars is in< in a profit anything below zero dollars in a profit anything below zero dollars is< is in a loss so many times you know is in a loss so many times you know people< people choose to hold their trade you people choose to hold their trade you know< know all the way to expiration because know all the way to expiration because maybe< maybe you know about 20 days into the maybe you know about 20 days into the trade< trade maybe the market is somewhere trade maybe the market is somewhere around< around here so if you were holding on to around here so if you were holding on to a< a normal American style option right on a normal American style option right on the< the index ETF or individual stocks then the index ETF or individual stocks then at< at this point there is you know some at this point there is you know some chance< chance that you could get an early chance that you could get an early assignment< assignment on your put option here right assignment on your put option here right so< so this is where you have your shot put so this is where you have your shot put down< down here so anything that is below the down here so anything that is below the shot< shot put you know there is always a shot put you know there is always a chance< chance of getting a sign but with this chance of getting a sign but with this European< European style options this cash shuttle European style options this cash shuttle index< index options you won't get any index options you won't get any assignment< assignment at all so this is where assignment at all so this is where people< people will actually just choose to hold people will actually just choose to hold on< on the trade you know and they don't on the trade you know and they don't have< have to worry because because maybe you have to worry because because maybe you know< know over the next few weeks or days the know over the next few weeks or days the market< market could just bounce back up and market could just bounce back up and then< then get into this huge profit Zone and then get into this huge profit Zone and then< then if they hold it to expiration who then if they hold it to expiration who knows< knows it might just stay within this knows it might just stay within this Zone< Zone and they're going to rip the max Zone and they're going to rip the max profit< profit of this iron Condor right so that profit of this iron Condor right so that is< is why if you like to hold all the way is why if you like to hold all the way to< to expiration then trading this cash to expiration then trading this cash shuttle< shuttle index options might be very shuttle index options might be very suitable< suitable for you so basically right you suitable for you so basically right you can< can just hold it to expiration wait for can just hold it to expiration wait for the< the position to turn around and not the position to turn around and not worry< worry about an assignment all right so worry about an assignment all right so what< what are some cash shuttle index options what are some cash shuttle index options that< that are available for you to trade so that are available for you to trade so the< the first one is SPX I'm pretty sure you the first one is SPX I'm pretty sure you would< would already know about this if you are would already know about this if you are trading< trading for quite a while now this is trading for quite a while now this is probably< probably the most liquid of this you probably the most liquid of this you know< know whole list that I have here then know whole list that I have here then you< you have XSP which I just mentioned you have XSP which I just mentioned earlier< earlier is just the mini SPX 500 Index earlier is just the mini SPX 500 Index options< options then you have rut which is the options then you have rut which is the Russell< Russell 2000 Index options you have the Russell 2000 Index options you have the M< M Rod which is the Mini version and then M Rod which is the Mini version and then you< you have the ndx and the oex right so you have the ndx and the oex right so ndx< ndx is the most likely the biggest one ndx is the most likely the biggest one so< so it's even bigger than SPX so if you so it's even bigger than SPX so if you do< do not have that big of an account then do not have that big of an account then chances< chances are that you might likely want chances are that you might likely want to< to just stick to you know the XSP and to just stick to you know the XSP and also< also the M run so why do you want to also the M run so why do you want to trade< trade cash shuttle index options as trade cash shuttle index options as opposed< opposed to index ETFs or individual opposed to index ETFs or individual stocks< stocks right what are the advantages stocks right what are the advantages over< over you know them so here are a few over you know them so here are a few reasons< reasons why you might want to trade them reasons why you might want to trade them so< so first of all it's decently tight bid so first of all it's decently tight bid enough< enough spread is pretty high liquidity enough spread is pretty high liquidity now< now the liquidity of course is not as now the liquidity of course is not as high< high as index ETFs but it's pretty high as index ETFs but it's pretty decent< decent right you know let's say for decent right you know let's say for example< example on spy Spy maybe your spread example on spy Spy maybe your spread could< could be you know just a few cents wide could be you know just a few cents wide right< right one cents two cents three cents right one cents two cents three cents wide< wide but for XSP it's not that tight of wide but for XSP it's not that tight of a< a spread compared to the Spy but it's a spread compared to the Spy but it's still< still pretty decent right I think it's still pretty decent right I think it's about< about 10 cents wide thereabouts right so about 10 cents wide thereabouts right so it's< it's still definitely tradable now the it's still definitely tradable now the next< next reason is that there is no need to next reason is that there is no need to worry< worry about early assignment right so worry about early assignment right so this< this is a very big plus for why you this is a very big plus for why you might< might want to trade cash shuttle index might want to trade cash shuttle index options< options and then there is no need to options and then there is no need to worry< worry about getting into a margin call worry about getting into a margin call from< from assignment or share so this is one from assignment or share so this is one of< of the biggest uh scariest things that of the biggest uh scariest things that many< many Traders or newer Traders they feel many Traders or newer Traders they feel when< when they get into training options when they get into training options right< right the moment the options get into right the moment the options get into the< the money right once it's in the money the money right once it's in the money they< they start to panic right but if you they start to panic right but if you trade< trade cash Shadow index options then trade cash Shadow index options then guess< guess what there's no need to panic guess what there's no need to panic because< because there's no such thing as early because there's no such thing as early assignment< assignment or even assignment of shares assignment or even assignment of shares so< so what that means is that you can hold so what that means is that you can hold your< your trades to expiration if you want your trades to expiration if you want and< and it's a very good way for beginners and it's a very good way for beginners to< to get started trading options alright to get started trading

com slash blueprint< blueprint or right back to the video now blueprint or right back to the video now first< first of all you can trade The Usual first of all you can trade The Usual Suspects< Suspects right the usual ones that you Suspects right the usual ones that you would< would normally trade on the index ETFs would normally trade on the index ETFs and< and that would be the credit spreads and that would be the credit spreads right< right you have the blue put spread which right you have the blue put spread which is< is the put credit spread and then you is the put credit spread and then you also< also have the bad call spread also known also have the bad call spread also known as< as the call Credit spread so all this as the call Credit spread so all this are< are pretty good as well because one are pretty good as well because one thing< thing is that if the market you know thing is that if the market you know breaches< breaches your short strike even breaches breaches your short strike even breaches your< your long strike there's no need for you your long strike there's no need for you to< to do anything you can even just hold on to do anything you can even just hold on to< to it all the way to expiration if you to it all the way to expiration if you want< want because the max loss that you can want because the max loss that you can have< have is already you know you already have is already you know you already know< know what's your max risk right it's know what's your max risk right it's just< just basically the width minus of the just basically the width minus of the credit< credit which you receive and there's no credit which you receive and there's no risk< risk of early assignments so there's no risk of early assignments so there's no need< need to worry right if you will hold it need to worry right if you will hold it on< on the index ETFs then if there's you on the index ETFs then if there's you know< know less than 21 DTE and the extrinsic know less than 21 DTE and the extrinsic value< value of this shock call is not much value of this shock call is not much then< then guess what there's a pretty good then guess what there's a pretty good chance< chance you're going to get assigned but chance you're going to get assigned but on< on the cash shuttle index options you on the cash shuttle index options you don't< don't have to worry about that now you don't have to worry about that now you have< have the iron content as well so iron have the iron content as well so iron condo< condo can be a pretty good trade so condo can be a pretty good trade so again< again you can hold this all the way to again you can hold this all the way to expiration< expiration and you know you reach the expiration and you know you reach the max< max profit if you want max profit if you want and< and if you have a bigger account size and if you have a bigger account size right< right then you can trade the strangle right then you can trade the strangle right< right strangle is basically the right strangle is basically the undefined< undefined risk version of the iron undefined risk version of the iron Condor< Condor and you can also trade the shot Condor and you can also trade the shot put< put right short put is just the put right short put is just the undefined< undefined risk version of the blue put undefined risk version of the blue put spread< spread but notice that I did not put the spread but notice that I did not put the short< short call here reason is because these short call here reason is because these are< are indexes right so indexes generally are indexes right so indexes generally have< have a positive drift that means over have a positive drift that means over time< time it generally wants to go up so I do time it generally wants to go up so I do not< not suggest that you trade any naked not suggest that you trade any naked call< call for whatever reason because if you call for whatever reason because if you get< get caught in it then even though if get caught in it then even though if it's< it's a cash settle index option you it's a cash settle index option you still< still can lose a lot of money if the still can lose a lot of money if the market< market just you know keeps going up so market just you know keeps going up so these< these are the strategies that you can these are the strategies that you can trade< trade for the cash Shadow index options trade for the cash Shadow index options however< however in my opinion the best strategy however in my opinion the best strategy is< is to trade cash shuttle index options is to trade cash shuttle index options are< are actually what I call slow spreads are actually what I call slow spreads right< right so what are slow spreads so there right so what are slow spreads so there are< are slow spreads like the Iron Butterfly are slow spreads like the Iron Butterfly so< so the Iron Butterfly is basically you so the Iron Butterfly is basically you know< know you have a call spread and a put know you have a call spread and a put spread< spread together just that the short spread together just that the short strikes< strikes of your shot caller and the shot strikes of your shot caller and the shot put< put are the same strike right so you end put are the same strike right so you end up< up with this kind of p l right so it's up with this kind of p l right so it's pretty< pretty much like a tent down here and pretty much like a tent down here and then< then your p l the graph the zero will be then your p l the graph the zero will be somewhere< somewhere down here so anything above somewhere down here so anything above here< here would be in a profit okay and here would be in a profit okay and anything< anything below here would be a loss and anything below here would be a loss and as< as you can see the original reward here as you can see the original reward here is< is pretty good right the the downside of is pretty good right the the downside of this< this is that you know you're probably a this is that you know you're probably a profit< profit is not that high right although profit is not that high right although you< you get you know a pretty nice you know you get you know a pretty nice you know Max< Max profit if you so happen to hit this Max profit if you so happen to hit this uh< uh tent the highest point of the tent to uh tent the highest point of the tent to get< get your max profit all right so this is get your max profit all right so this is the< the Iron Butterfly so another slow the Iron Butterfly so another slow spread< spread is the put broken wing butterfly spread is the put broken wing butterfly so< so basically it's the same as the so basically it's the same as the butterfly< butterfly for this just that you shift butterfly for this just that you shift it< it down right so if you shift down and it down right so if you shift down and then< then you use all put options instead then you use all put options instead right< right so as you can see down here it's right so as you can see down here it's all< all consists of put options then you all consists of put options then you have< have the put broken wing butterfly right have the put broken wing butterfly right basically< basically what it is is that you're basically what it is is that you're using< using the put spread down here right using the put spread down here right just< just imagine down here this is a put just imagine down here this is a put spread< spread minus one put and plus one you spread minus one put and plus one you are< are selling this put spread to finance a are selling this put spread to finance a debit< debit spread down here right so you are debit spread down here right so you are selling< selling the put spread to finance a long selling the put spread to finance a long put< put spread so this is how you get a put put spread so this is how you get a put broken< broken butterfly so there is no risk to broken butterfly so there is no risk to the< the upside so this is also what I the upside so this is also what I consider< consider a slow spread and the last one consider a slow spread and the last one is< is if you have a little bit more Capital is if you have a little bit more Capital then< then you can trade the put ratio spread then you can trade the put ratio spread so< so the put ratio spread is something I so the put ratio spread is something I talked< talked quite a bit on my channel it's talked quite a bit on my channel it's one< one of my favorite strategies as well go one of my favorite strategies as well go ahead< ahead to my channel if you're interested ahead to my channel if you're interested you< you know just type up put ratio spread you know just type up put ratio spread you< you will be able to see quite a number you will be able to see quite a number of< of videos in my channel so basically the of videos in my channel so basically the put< put ratio spread is the undefined wrist put ratio spread is the undefined wrist version< version of the put broken wing butterfly version of the put broken wing butterfly now< now what exactly are slow spread so I've now what exactly are slow spread so I've been< been talking about slow spread so what been talking about slow spread so what exactly< exactly are they and why do I think they exactly are they and why do I think they are< are the best strategies to trade on cash are the best strategies to trade on cash shuttle< shuttle index options so slow spreads shuttle index options so slow spreads are< are basically just slow moving spreads are basically just slow moving spreads right< right slow moving spreads basically what right slow moving spreads basically what it< it means is that it takes a long time to it means is that it takes a long time to hit< hit its Max profit potential and it's hit its Max profit potential and it's difficult< difficult to hold this press to difficult to hold this press to expiration< expiration on index ETFs and stocks expiration on index ETFs and stocks because< because there's a chance of being because there's a chance of being assigned< assigned right so I give you two assigned right so I give you two examples< examples down here so on the top side examples down here so on the top side you< you can see this is the iron Condor you can see this is the iron Condor right< right so as you can see this is the iron right so as you can see this is the iron Condor< Condor I use the example of the 47 DTE Condor I use the example of the 47 DTE iron< iron Condor and this is at 14 DTE what iron Condor and this is at 14 DTE what it< it means is that I when I open the it means is that I when I open the spread< spread it's at 47 DTE and this p l graph spread it's at 47 DTE and this p l graph down< down here you can see this purple line down here you can see this purple line this< this is when there's 14 days left to this is when there's 14 days left to expiration< expiration that means after 14 days this expiration that means after 14 days this whole< whole spread will expire so that means whole spread will expire so that means at< at this point it has been helpful about at this point it has been helpful about what< what 33 days so you can see that at 33 what 33 days so you can see that at 33 days< days is this purple line down here now days is this purple line down here now this< this purple line down here as you can this purple line down here as you can see< see at this center point it's almost at see at this center point it's almost at the< the max profit right the max profit is the max profit right the max profit is where< where the green line is and that's where where the green line is and that's where it's< it's at expiration so an expiration it's at expiration so an expiration basically< basically your p l will be the. green basically your p l will be the green line< line so at 14 DT you can see that the line so at 14 DT you can see that the line< line is pretty close to where your max line is pretty close to where your max profit< profit is so it means that if the market profit is so it means that if the market you< you know settles somewhere in the middle you know settles somewhere in the middle at< at around 14 DTE you can safely take you at around 14 DTE you can safely take you know< know more than 50 of the profit right know more than 50 of the profit right but< but now let's take a look at the Iron but now let's take a look at the Iron Butterfly< Butterfly now Iron Butterfly we have the Butterfly now Iron Butterfly we have the same< same parameters right we put it on at 47 same parameters right we put it on at 47 DTE< DTE now there's a 14 DTE left but as you DTE now there's a 14 DTE left but as you can< can see down here if the price or rather can see down here if the price or rather the< the market is somewhere in the middle the market is somewhere in the middle where< where it is when we first put it on well where it is when we first put it on well you< you can see that it's not even at 50 you can see that it's not even at 50 right< right at this point down here it's not right at this point down here it's not even< even at 50 so as you can see this is why even at 50 so as you can see this is why it's< it's a very very slow spread and the it's a very very slow spread and the reason< reason is because right the strikes are reason is because right the strikes are very< very close to each other so the closer very close to each other so the closer the< the strikes are to each other and where the strikes are to each other and where your< your max profit is is basically where your max profit is is basically where you< you know Market has to be the expiration you know Market has to be the expiration then< then it's going to be very difficult for then it's going to be very difficult for it< it to achieve its Max profit until you it to achieve its Max profit until you know< know it's very close to expiration like know it's very close to expiration like one< one or two days left now let's fast one or two days left now let's fast forward< forward this to 7 DTE right so that forward this to 7 DTE right so that means< means another seven days have passed means another seven days have passed since< since the 14 DTE so now there's just one since the 14 DTE so now there's just one week< week left to expiration and as you can week left to expiration and as you can see< see for the iron Condor it has pretty see for the iron Condor it has pretty much< much you know pretty much just touched much you know pretty much just touched the< the max profit at the center line down the max profit at the center line down here< here at the center of the iron Condor here at the center of the iron Condor but< but whereas for the Iron Butterfly you but whereas for the Iron Butterfly you can< can see that it is not anywhere close can see that it is not anywhere close right< right it's probably at 50 right maybe right it's probably at 50 right maybe not< not even at 50 so this is at 7 DTE so not even at 50 so this is at 7 DTE so many< many days have passed right 4 40 days many days have passed right 4 40 days have< have passed but it's still nowhere near have passed but it's still nowhere near the< the max profit Zone down here as you can the max profit Zone down here as you can see< see you know there's quite a big see you know there's quite a big difference< difference in the profit zone so you difference in the profit zone so you have< have helped for 40 days and not even 50 have helped for 40 days and not even 50 of< of it has been reached but if you were of it has been reached but if you were to< to hold it for just seven more days then to hold it for just seven more days then it's< it's going to realize you know the it's going to realize you know the profit< profit potential is going to be much profit potential is going to be much greater< greater than where it is so as you can greater than where it is so as you can see< see this is what I mean by a slow moving see this is what I mean by a slow moving spread< spread it takes a very long time for you spread it takes a very long time for you to< to reach the max profit so if you were to reach the max profit so if you were to< to trade this traditionally on the index to trade this traditionally on the index ETFs< ETFs you'll find it very very difficult ETFs you'll find it very very difficult for< for you to actually try and you know for you to actually try and you know milk< milk the most profit out of this milk the most profit out of this strategy< strategy because you have the problem of strategy because you have the problem of being< being early assigned right for this Iron being early assigned right for this Iron Butterfly< Butterfly it has to be close to where Butterfly it has to be close to where the< the short strike is and it has to be the short strike is and it has to be there< there at expiration but if you are there at expiration but if you are already< already in the money right if you notice already in the money right if you notice you< you have a shot put and a short call you have a shot put and a short call that< that means that regardless of where you that means that regardless of where you know< know the price is one of the strikes is know the price is one of the strikes is going< going to be in the money right if it's going to be in the money right if it's going< going to be somewhere at this point down going to be somewhere at this point down here here here then< then your shot put is going to be in the then your shot put is going to be in the money< money and if somewhere down here then money and if somewhere down here then your< your short call is going to be in the your short call is going to be in the money< money because your shot put and your money because your shot put and your short< short call are all down here right you short call are all down here right you have< have one shot put and you have one short have one shot put and you have one short call< call and once it's very close to call and once it's very close to expiration< expiration then there's a very good expiration then there's a very good chance< chance you're going to get a sign so chance you're going to get a sign so imagine< imagine you get assigned on one side imagine you get assigned on one side let's< let's say for example you get assigned let's say for example you get assigned on< on the put side you're going to have 100 on the put side you're going to have 100 shares< shares then you're gonna have one short shares then you're gonna have one short call< call you're gonna have one long call one call you're gonna have one long call one long< long put and this is going to be very long put and this is going to be very confusing< confusing right for many people so that confusing right for many people so that is< is why this types of strategies is much is why this types of strategies is much better< better to be put on your cash shuttle better to be put on your cash shuttle index< index option so the reason why slow index option so the reason why slow spreads< spreads are very good to trade on cash spreads are very good to trade on cash shuttle< shuttle index options is because you can shuttle index options is because you can hold< hold your expiration or close to hold your expiration or close to expiration< expiration if you choose to and not expiration if you choose to and not worry< worry about getting a sign so this is worry about getting a sign so this is one< one of the reasons why I kind of like to one of the reasons why I kind of like to trade< trade a lot of this uh slow spreads on trade a lot of this uh slow spreads on cash< cash Shadow index options as you can see cash Shadow index options as you can see I< I like to trade the M rod and I also I like to trade the M rod and I also like< like to trade the XSP and as of this like to trade the XSP and as of this recording< recording you can see that I have a recording you can see that I have a ratio< ratio spread on right you can see this ratio spread on right you can see this is< is the put ratio spread on this is where is the put ratio spread on this is where the< the max profit is which is roughly the max profit is which is roughly around< around a thousand five hundred dollars around a thousand five hundred dollars at< at this point and then right now this is at this point and then right now this is where< where the current market price is so at where the current market price is so at this< this point down here is roughly about this point down here is roughly about you< you know 530 odd dollars okay so this is you know 530 odd dollars okay so this is roughly< roughly about three days left to roughly about three days left to expiration< expiration or maybe even you know two or expiration or maybe even you know two or four< four somewhere around there and that is four somewhere around there and that is why< why you can see down here the purple why you can see down here the purple line< line it is pretty close to where the line it is pretty close to where the expiration< expiration uh line the p l graph is but expiration uh line the p l graph is but as< as you can see it's still nowhere close as you can see it's still nowhere close right< right it's about fifty percent about 50 right it's about fifty percent about 50 and< and the remaining 50 will only be you and the remaining 50 will only be you know< know potentially reached at you know the know potentially reached at you know the next< next two to three days so again this is next two to three days so again this is why< why you want to trade slow moving spread why you want to trade slow moving spread only< only a cash settle index options all only a cash settle index options all right< right guys so I hope this video has been right guys so I hope this video has been helpful< helpful for you and if you have never helpful for you and if you have never traded< traded the cash shuttle index options traded the cash shuttle index options before< before I do suggest maybe you just do a before I do suggest maybe you just do a little< little paper trading on it first you little paper trading on it first you know< know just to get a feel for it and once know just to get a feel for it and once you< you know you're comfortable with it then you know you're comfortable with it then you< you can start to trade your real money you can start to trade your real money with< with it by the way if you like this with it by the way if you like this video< video

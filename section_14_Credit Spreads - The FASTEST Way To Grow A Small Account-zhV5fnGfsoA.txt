========================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so today's video I'm all right alrighty so today's video I'm going< going to be talking about credit spreads going to be talking about credit spreads and< and in my opinion I think that this is and in my opinion I think that this is the< the fastest way to grow a small account the fastest way to grow a small account especially< especially if you have an account size especially if you have an account size that< that is under 25 000 that means you that is under 25 000 that means you could< could have an account size of fifteen could have an account size of fifteen thousand< thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars or< or even five thousand dollars and I'm or even five thousand dollars and I'm gonna< gonna explain to you why but first off gonna explain to you why but first off what< what are credit spreads right so credit what are credit spreads right so credit spreads< spreads they are also called the short spreads they are also called the short vertical< vertical spreads and these are premium vertical spreads and these are premium selling< selling defined risk option strategies selling defined risk option strategies that< that lets you take a semi-directional that lets you take a semi-directional bat< bat in the market which also means that bat in the market which also means that you< you do not necessarily have to be right you do not necessarily have to be right on< on the direction if you're slightly on the direction if you're slightly wrong< wrong you still are able to profit from wrong you still are able to profit from this< this code Express and I'm going to this code Express and I'm going to explain< explain to you why later on but credit explain to you why later on but credit spreads< spreads well basically they come in two spreads well basically they come in two flavors< flavors you have the bullish flavor flavors you have the bullish flavor which< which is what you call the shot put which is what you call the shot put spread< spread also known as The Bull put spread spread also known as The Bull put spread so< so basically what you do is you sell and so basically what you do is you sell and all< all of the money put option all of the money put option all< all right selling automatic production all right selling automatic production and< and then you buy back in further out of and then you buy back in further out of the< the money put option so in this case the money put option so in this case you're< you're pretty much hedging your risk you're pretty much hedging your risk because< because if you just sold the shot put because if you just sold the shot put down< down here this would be considered just down here this would be considered just a< a naked put and the wrist would a naked put and the wrist would basically< basically be unlimited until zero so if basically be unlimited until zero so if the< the stock really goes to zero then the stock really goes to zero then you're< you're gonna lose a lot of money down you're gonna lose a lot of money down here< here so that is why we have this long here so that is why we have this long put< put so assuming right this is the stock put so assuming right this is the stock and< and let's say that you have a bullish and let's say that you have a bullish Outlook< Outlook you think that the market is Outlook you think that the market is going< going to bounce back so what you do is going to bounce back so what you do is basically< basically you sell a put option that is basically you sell a put option that is out< out of the money right so you sell put out of the money right so you sell put option< option here that's further out the money option here that's further out the money and< and then you buy back another put option and then you buy back another put option that< that is further out of the money so in that is further out of the money so in this< this case you kind of hatch the risk to this case you kind of hatch the risk to the< the maximum of the width of this spread the maximum of the width of this spread so< so from here to here now some people so from here to here now some people also< also do add the money uh put spread so also do add the money uh put spread so that< that means you could have sold the shot that means you could have sold the shot put< put here right you sold the put option put here right you sold the put option here< here and then maybe you buy and put here and then maybe you buy and put option< option here this is at the money some option here this is at the money some people< people would even go to do an in the people would even go to do an in the money< money uh shot put spread that means that money uh shot put spread that means that they're< they're going to have the shot put that they're going to have the shot put that is< is in the money right that is above the is in the money right that is above the current< current market price and then you have current market price and then you have the< the loan put somewhere either at the the loan put somewhere either at the market< market or for the Art Market now market or for the Art Market now for< for me personally I do not do that I for me personally I do not do that I prefer< prefer to go for the approach where I go prefer to go for the approach where I go for< for the uh out of the money right that for the uh out of the money right that is< is because you have the probability in is because you have the probability in your< your favor basically what it means is your favor basically what it means is that< that if the market still all right let that if the market still all right let me< me just remove this so you can see it me just remove this so you can see it more< more clearly so let's say for example if more clearly so let's say for example if the< the market the market you're< you're slightly wrong in the direction you're slightly wrong in the direction it< it comes down here and then it just it comes down here and then it just dwindles< dwindles sideways does nothing at dwindles sideways does nothing at expression< expression so in this case in a sense expression so in this case in a sense you're< you're wrong in the direction right you're wrong in the direction right because< because it came down lower from whence because it came down lower from whence you< you put on this shot uh put spread but you put on this shot uh put spread but you're< you're still able to profit because it you're still able to profit because it did< did not Bridge your short put strike of did not Bridge your short put strike of your< your shot put spread right but if you your shot put spread right but if you had< had done let's say and add the money had done let's say and add the money all< all right so imagine this is the shot all right so imagine this is the shot put< put all right the shot put and then you put all right the shot put and then you let's< let's say you bought a long put just let's say you bought a long put just below< below that right now in this case it below that right now in this case it would< would be a loss because the price has would be a. loss because the price has now< now gone below your shot put strike now gone below your shot put strike right< right so you don't really have a right so you don't really have a probability< probability in your favor although you probability in your favor although you have< have a larger credit up front now in have a larger credit up front now in this< this case for me I prefer credit spreads this case for me I prefer credit spreads where< where I do have an advantage in terms of where I do have an advantage in terms of probability< probability so that in the long run probability so that in the long run right< right at least I will I'll tend to win right at least I will I'll tend to win more< more often than I lose right so some more often than I lose right so some people< people do add the money some people do people do add the money some people do in< in the money I prefer out of the money in the money I prefer out of the money now< now the next flavor is the bearish now the next flavor is the bearish flavor< flavor right so this is what you call flavor right so this is what you call the< the short call spread also known as the the short call spread also known as the bear< bear color spread so this is the bear color spread so this is the opposite< opposite of the boot spread so the bull opposite of the boot spread so the bull pull< pull spread we are using basically put pull spread we are using basically put options< options for this bearish credit spread options for this bearish credit spread we're< we're going to use call options so it's we're going to use call options so it's basically< basically just the opposite right so basically just the opposite right so you're< you're gonna sell the all the money call you're gonna sell the all the money call option< option and then you're gonna launch it option and then you're gonna launch it further< further out of the money call option so further out of the money call option so for< for example this is the market right for example this is the market right let's< let's say it's going up and you think let's say it's going up and you think that< that the market is going to go back down that the market is going to go back down you< you have a bearish outlook on this so you have a bearish outlook on this so what< what we're going to do is you're going what we're going to do is you're going to< to sell in all of the money call option to sell in all of the money call option and< and then you hedge it or rather you and then you hedge it or rather you define< define the risk on this uh naked call define the risk on this uh naked call right< right with a long call option so this right with a long call option so this way< way you have a spread so this way way you have a spread so this way again< again the max loss will be the distance again the max loss will be the distance of< of this width minus of the credit which of this width minus of the credit which you< you receive I'm going to explain more you receive I'm going to explain more about< about this later on but basically what about this later on but basically what you< you need to know here is that your max you need to know here is that your max risk< risk is kept right so you have always risk is kept right so you have always heard< heard that you know it's dangerous to go heard that you know it's dangerous to go naked< naked right to go naked put naked call naked right to go naked put naked call and< and that is true to a certain extent if and that is true to a certain extent if you< you don't know what you're doing but in you don't know what you're doing but in a< a sense if you have a small account a sense if you have a small account where< where your account size is small then where your account size is small then it's< it's definitely much better if you are it's definitely much better if you are to< to do a credit spread because this case to do a credit spread because this case right< right you do not just let one trade go right you do not just let one trade go against< against you because what if the market against you because what if the market right< right let's say it really shoots to the right let's say it really shoots to the Moon< Moon right it goes all the way to you Moon right it goes all the way to you know< know from a dollar maybe shoots up to know from a dollar maybe shoots up to 100< 100 or something like that in this case 100 or something like that in this case even< even though it goes to 100 your max loss even though it goes to 100 your max loss has< has been kept but if you have a naked has been kept but if you have a naked call< call then guess what you have to absorb call then guess what you have to absorb all< all the losses as it goes up and really all the losses as it goes up and really your< your loss will be unlimited right so your loss will be unlimited right so this< this is why the credit spread is good this is why the credit spread is good for< for this small account so for this small account so let's< let's get into this a little bit more so let's get into this a little bit more so why< why use credit spreads for small counts why use credit spreads for small counts well< well first of all is a high probability well first of all is a high probability trade< trade setup right generally the way I do trade setup right generally the way I do it< it is where the probability of profit is it is where the probability of profit is more< more than 70 right I'm going to share more than 70 right I'm going to share with< with you the mechanics but basically in with you the mechanics but basically in a< a nutshell I like to go for the shot put a nutshell I like to go for the shot put strike< strike somewhere around 30 Deltas right strike somewhere around 30 Deltas right 30< 30 Deltas or less so this way I'm always 30 Deltas or less so this way I'm always selling< selling uh slightly away from the market selling uh slightly away from the market so< so as you can see this is a shot put so as you can see this is a shot put spread< spread also known as The Bull Hood spread also known as The Bull Hood spread< spread so this is where the current spread so this is where the current market< market price is so you can see that most market price is so you can see that most of< of the time when we are doing the credit of the time when we are doing the credit spread< spread but rather the shot put spread in spread but rather the shot put spread in this< this case we're going to sell the shot this case we're going to sell the shot put< put spread away from the current market put spread away from the current market right< right so in this case we're gonna go right so in this case we're gonna go below< below the market if you're doing a bad below the market if you're doing a bad call< call spread you'll be above the current call spread you'll be above the current market< market price so this way uh you can see market price so this way uh you can see down< down here the percentage is 71. 37 so down here the percentage is 71.

37 so you're< you're gonna be right more often than you're gonna be right more often than you're< you're wrong right so you're going to be you're wrong right so you're going to be winning< winning more often than you're not so winning more often than you're not so the< the good thing about this credit spread the good thing about this credit spread as< as well is that time Decay is on your as well is that time Decay is on your side< side so because this is a premium side so because this is a premium selling< selling strategy so as you can see this selling strategy so as you can see this curve< curve right here is the p l that you curve right here is the p l that you have< have for when you put on the trade right have for when you put on the trade right so< so as in the moment you put on the trade so as in the moment you put on the trade let's< let's say today you put on the trade let's say today you put on the trade this< this is your p l graph but you notice this is your p l graph but you notice the< the green line is at expiration so it the green line is at expiration so it means< means that let's say for example if the means that let's say for example if the market< market actually goes down to 180 dollars market actually goes down to 180 dollars right< right at this point today itself you'll right at this point today itself you'll be< be losing money right you can see at be losing money right you can see at this< this point this is the zero dollars line this point this is the zero dollars line right< right anything below the zero dollars right anything below the zero dollars this< this this line down here you're in a this this line down here you're in a loss< loss anything above here is a profit so loss anything above here is a profit so let's< let's say it goes down to 180 today for let's say it goes down to 180 today for some< some reason right then you would be at a some reason right then you would be at a loss< loss but guess what because of time loss but guess what because of time Decay< Decay on your side and because you have Decay on your side and because you have a< a short put strike that is out of the a short put strike that is out of the money< money which is beef uh way below this money which is beef uh way below this current< current price current price at< at expiration what happens is that this at expiration what happens is that this purple< purple line will slowly go up because of purple line will slowly go up because of time< time Decay to this final Point down here time Decay to this final Point down here so< so that means that if you actually help so that means that if you actually help this< this shot put spread all the way to this shot put spread all the way to expiration< expiration and assuming that the price expiration and assuming that the price actually< actually just settles at 180 at actually just settles at 180 at expiration< expiration you'd still be at a profit expiration you'd still be at a profit even< even though right you entered this trade even though right you entered this trade when< when the current market price is much when the current market price is much higher< higher so that is why this is time Decay higher so that is why this is time Decay right< right time Decay is going to work for right time Decay. is going to work for you< you if you are inside of the break-even you if you are inside of the break-even point< point so this is the break-even point point so this is the break-even point down< down here down here all< all right anything past this is you're all right anything past this is you're gonna< gonna lose money above this and gonna lose money above this and expiration< expiration you're gonna make money so expiration you're gonna make money so let< let me just remove all this uh drawings let me just remove all this uh drawings to< to make it much clearer to make it much clearer so< so basically what you want is to ensure so basically what you want is to ensure that< that the price right does not go past that the price right does not go past this< this very even point so bring even Point this very even point so bring even Point anything< anything uh below before this point all anything uh below before this point all the< the way above here the time Decay is the way above here the time Decay is going< going to work for you because you as you going to work for you because you as you can< can see you're gonna lose lesser right can see you're gonna lose lesser right you're< you're going to lose lesser as this p l you're going to lose lesser as this p l graph< graph is going to fit up anything below graph is going to fit up anything below here< here or rather the break-in Point uh here or rather the break-in Point uh past< past this point in fact you're going to past this point in fact you're going to start< start to lose even more money as time start to lose even more money as time goes< goes on so this is where the time Decay goes on so this is where the time Decay actually< actually works against you because actually works against you because remember< remember you have a spread on that means remember you have a spread on that means you< you have a short strike and a long you have a short strike and a long strike< strike and that is why this friction strike and that is why this friction between< between these two strikes is causing between these two strikes is causing this< this part right towards expiration is this part right towards expiration is going< going to finally come down to this graph going to finally come down to this graph down< down here so I'm going to show you how down here so I'm going to show you how to< to manage it later on to manage it later on because< because at most of the time I do not because at most of the time I do not tend< tend to hold the spread to expiration tend to hold the spread to expiration especially< especially if it's outside of this especially if it's outside of this break-even< break-even point this way you will limit break-even point this way you will limit your< your loss all right so next quick your loss all right so next quick profits< profits if you're right on the direction profits if you're right on the direction so< so as you can see this is a bullish uh so as you can see this is a bullish uh setup< setup there's a bullish option strategy setup there's a bullish option strategy so< so if at the point of time when you put so if at the point of time when you put it< it on if the market goes up it on if the market goes up let's< let's say from 180 it goes all the way let's say from 180 it goes all the way to< to sorry around 180 2. 5 goes all the way to sorry around 180 2.

5 goes all the way to< to around 190 something you're going to to around 190 something you're going to make< make money right so it takes a few days make money right so it takes a few days you're< you're gonna make money it's definitely you're gonna make money it's definitely much< much faster than neutral strategies such much faster than neutral strategies such as< as iron Condors right iron Condors is as iron Condors right iron Condors is basically< basically both sides of the credit basically both sides of the credit spread< spread so you have the shot put spread spread so you have the shot put spread plus< plus the short call spread so you get plus the short call spread so you get iron< iron Condor now if you're not very iron Condor now if you're not very familiar< familiar with the iron Condor is I've familiar with the iron Condor is I've actually< actually created a video dedicated to actually created a video dedicated to the< the iron Condor you can go ahead and the iron Condor you can go ahead and watch< watch that I'll put the link at the top watch that I'll put the link at the top right< right hand of the corner but basically right hand of the corner but basically what< what you need to know is that because what you need to know is that because this< this is a semi-directional right some this is a semi-directional right some people< people say it's a directional trade people say it's a directional trade either< either way you want to put it as long as either way you want to put it as long as the< the trade goes in the direction of where the trade goes in the direction of where you< you put it you're going to see the you put it you're going to see the profits< profits very quickly right iron Condor profits very quickly right iron Condor you're< you're going to be a friction because you're going to be a friction because you< you want to make sure it stays in within you want to make sure it stays in within a< a certain range right let's say for a certain range right let's say for example< example you have the call spread down example you have the call spread down here< here all the way to the bottom so here all the way to the bottom so basically< basically you want to stay in within basically you want to stay in within this< this range between this range and this range between this range and expiration< expiration so it takes much longer next expiration so it takes much longer next is< is that you can be wrong in Direction is that you can be wrong in Direction but< but still profit as I mentioned earlier but still profit as I mentioned earlier right< right if the market comes down to this right if the market comes down to this point< point expiration you still can profit point expiration you still can profit right< right as you can see the p l graph will right as you can see the p l graph will be< be at Max profit at this point even be at Max profit at this point even though< though it's below the current price when though it's below the current price when you< you first put it on you first put it on the< the max risk is defined we talked about the max risk is defined we talked about it< it about this as well so this is it about this as well so this is important< important because with a small account important because with a small account you< you don't have a lot of cash you don't you don't have a lot of cash you don't have< have a lot of bullets so to speak so if have a lot of bullets so to speak so if you're< you're going to let just one single you're going to let just one single Trade< Trade A lot of people like to put on Trade A lot of people like to put on naked< naked puts and naked calls especially if naked puts and naked calls especially if you< you do them on those kinds of uh stocks you do them on those kinds of uh stocks or< or ETF that is a very high price then or ETF that is a very high price then you're< you're going to see that if one time the you're going to see that if one time the market< market actually moves against you very market actually moves against you very quickly< quickly you're going to lose a lot of quickly you're going to lose a lot of money< money especially what we've seen during money especially what we've seen during the< the pandemic and the recent 2022 crash the pandemic and the recent 2022 crash right right right so< so that is why with this uh vertical so that is why with this uh vertical spread< spread with this uh shot put spread in spread with this uh shot put spread in this< this graph you can see your loss is this graph you can see your loss is limited< limited so the market can go to zero for limited so the market can go to zero for all< all at once you're still going to lose all at once you're still going to lose the< the maximum down here now you can also the maximum down here now you can also use< use this on any stock or ETF regardless use this on any stock or ETF regardless of< of price compared to naked option of price compared to naked option strategies< strategies right nickel option strategies right nickel option strategies< strategies you have to take note of the strategies you have to take note of the buying< buying power and sometimes the buying buying power and sometimes the buying power< power will vary uh very dependent on power will vary uh very dependent on firstly< firstly the price of the stock of course firstly the price of the stock of course the< the more expensive stock you're going to the more expensive stock you're going to have< have higher buying power reduction so have higher buying power reduction so that's< that's going to take up much more of that's going to take up much more of your< your account and secondly when the your account and secondly when the market< market actually crashes when there's market actually crashes when there's High< High volatility your broker will High volatility your broker will increase< increase the buying power requirement increase the buying power requirement and< and that's going to increase the amount and that's going to increase the amount of< of uh Capital that's going to be hold up of uh Capital that's going to be hold up in< in that trade right so you're going to in that trade right so you're going to be< be uh you're not very sure how you're be uh you're not very sure how you're going< going to manage your position sizing but going to manage your position sizing but with< with this credit spread you know for with this credit spread you know for sure< sure every time what is your maximum sure every time what is your maximum risk< risk okay so you because your trade is risk okay so you because your trade is fixed< fixed your risk per trade is fixed fixed your risk per trade is fixed you're< you're able to pursue position size this you're able to pursue position size this is< is very properly alright so let's get is very properly alright so let's get into< into the mechanics so you know a little into the mechanics so you know a little bit< bit of how to put on this bull spread bit of how to put on this bull spread I'm< I'm going to share with you my mechanics I'm going to share with you my mechanics now< now you can change them in a way which now you can change them in a way which is< is suitable for you this is what I like is suitable for you this is what I like to< to do now there's no one set way you to do now there's no one set way you find< find one that is good for you but this find one that is good for you but this is< is mine so basically what I like to do is mine so basically what I like to do is< is I like to wait for the stochastic is I like to wait for the stochastic oscillator< oscillator to be oversold oscillator to be oversold all< all right I talk about the stochastic all right I talk about the stochastic oscillator< oscillator in another video as well you oscillator in another video as well you can< can go ahead and click the re-link at can go ahead and click the re-link at the< the top right hand corner of this video the top right hand corner of this video you< you. want to find out more about you want to find out more about stochastic< stochastic oscillator but basically what stochastic oscillator but basically what it< it does is that it just measures whether it does is that it just measures whether the< the market is overbought oversold the market is overbought oversold conditions< conditions right so if the we're going conditions right so if the we're going to< to go for a bullish setup then we want to go for a bullish setup then we want to< to try and put all the odds in our favor to try and put all the odds in our favor so< so one of the ways is to ensure that the so one of the ways is to ensure that the stochastic< stochastic oscillator is to be oversold stochastic oscillator is to be oversold right< right so if you want to put on a bullish right so if you want to put on a bullish trade< trade would you rather put it when it's trade would you rather put it when it's overboard< overboard or it's oversold right you overboard or it's oversold right you definitely< definitely want to put it oversold now definitely want to put it oversold now of< of course you can always go more of course you can always go more oversold< oversold and so on as I always mention oversold and so on as I always mention all< all those videos but at least you have a all those videos but at least you have a higher< higher chance of it working out right higher chance of it working out right you're< you're not going to win all the time but you're not going to win all the time but you're< you're going to win a lot of the times you're going to win a lot of the times and< and each time we win we want to make and each time we win we want to make sure< sure that the conditions are right next sure that the conditions are right next we< we want to sell on a down day right we we want to sell on a down day right we want< want to sell on a down day for increased want to sell on a down day for increased volatility< volatility because when the market is volatility because when the market is selling< selling off volatility increases and selling off volatility increases and because< because this is a credit spread this is because this is a credit spread this is a< a premium selling spread we tend to get a premium selling spread we tend to get more< more premium when the market is has an more premium when the market is has an increased< increased volatility so that's why we increased volatility so that's why we sell< sell on the down day now for me I like sell on the down day now for me I like to< to sell the 30 to 60 days to expiration to sell the 30 to 60 days to expiration some< some people like to go for the weekly some people like to go for the weekly again< again this is something that you want to again this is something that you want to try< try out for yourself I prefer the longer try out for yourself I prefer the longer data< data expiration only because I can get a data expiration only because I can get a strike< strike that is further out of the money strike that is further out of the money so< so for example if the stock is let's say so for example if the stock is let's say it's< it's doing this and let's say I want to it's doing this and let's say I want to get< get a strike somewhere at this point get a strike somewhere at this point down< down here all right pardon this uh not down here all right pardon this uh not so< so straight line let me just try that so straight line let me just try that again again again there< there you go all right so let's say I there you go all right so let's say I want< want to go for this strike I've decided want to go for this strike I've decided I< I want to go for this strike so now I I want to go for this strike so now I have< have two options if you have the weekly have two options if you have the weekly options< options chances are that I might not be options chances are that I might not be able< able to get this strike because weekly able to get this strike because weekly options< options right if you're going to go for options right if you're going to go for something< something 30 Deltas it might be nearer something 30 Deltas it might be nearer to< to the market and I might not be that to the market and I might not be that comfortable< comfortable with that but if I go comfortable with that but if I go something< something for 30 to 60 days to something for 30 to 60 days to expiration< expiration I can see that I can get a expiration I can see that I can get a further< further away strike which is what I want further away strike which is what I want which< which is also technically I might be which is also technically I might be looking looking looking all< all right maybe this is the previous law all right maybe this is the previous law right< right so this is previously I want to right so this is previously I want to make< make sure that my short strike point is make sure that my short strike point is below< below this previous low so if you're below this previous low so if you're going< going to go for a weekly option maybe going to go for a weekly option maybe two< two weeks out three weeks out right you two weeks out three weeks out right you may< may have to wait for the market to calm may have to wait for the market to calm down< down a little bit further before you down a little bit further before you enter< enter the trade or you might just have enter the trade or you might just have to< to you know just go for a nearest strike to you know just go for a nearest strike okay< okay again this is all up to you to go okay again this is all up to you to go and< and try out for yourself next for the and try out for yourself next for the shock< shock strike I like to go for around 20 shock strike I like to go for around 20 to< to 30 Deltas that is how I ensure to 30 Deltas that is how I ensure roughly< roughly my trade is around 70 sometimes roughly my trade is around 70 sometimes 60< 60 something percent right and 60 something percent right and preferably< preferably below a support level or preferably below a support level or previous< previous low which I talked about all previous low which I talked about all right< right you're gonna look at the previous right you're gonna look at the previous low< low and I'm going to show you with a few low and I'm going to show you with a few trade< trade examples as well and your long trade examples as well and your long strike< strike I generally like to do it at five strike I generally like to do it at five dollars< dollars away right five dollars some dollars away right five dollars some people< people do ten dollars some people to two people do ten dollars some people to two dollars dollars dollars I< I like to do five dollars because this I like to do five dollars because this way< way I can have a proper way of counting way I can have a proper way of counting what< what is my uh risk so in this sense what is my uh risk so in this sense let's< let's say for example if your spread is let's say for example if your spread is five< five dollars why that means the maximum five dollars why that means the maximum loss< loss is gonna be five dollars minus the loss is gonna be five dollars minus the credit< credit you take so let's say if you take credit you take so let's say if you take a< a credit of one dollars and fifty cents a credit of one dollars and fifty cents which< which is what I suggest to get anywhere which is what I suggest to get anywhere from< from one dollars to one hundred one from one dollars to one hundred one dollar< dollar fifty cents in credit which is dollar fifty cents in credit which is 100< 100 150 per contract right so your 100 150 per contract right so your maximum< maximum risk will be five dollars minus maximum risk will be five dollars minus 100. 50< 100.

50 which is three dollars fifty 100. 50 which is three dollars fifty cents< cents right that's your maximum risk per cents right that's your maximum risk per trade< trade so I tend to always aim for this trade so I tend to always aim for this amount< amount next you want to raise a maximum amount next you want to raise a maximum of< of one to five percent per trade now the of one to five percent per trade now the next< next is trade management so this is next is trade management so this is pretty< pretty important so I want you to take pretty important so I want you to take some< some time to really uh listen to this some time to really uh listen to this part part part because< because there are four different methods because there are four different methods that< that you can use to manage it right so that you can use to manage it right so the< the first method is to just take profit the first method is to just take profit at< at 50 so what you want to do is you just at 50 so what you want to do is you just place< place a tip profit at 50 so it will place a tip profit at 50 so it will either< either expire when you lose the full either expire when you lose the full amount< amount or you get to take fifty percent amount or you get to take fifty percent profit< profit right so this is basically the profit right so this is basically the first< first method now the second method is first method now the second method is that< that you can just simply hold it to that you can just simply hold it to expiration< expiration or in a sense close to expiration or in a sense close to expiration< expiration right so you want to close it expiration right so you want to close it either< either a day before expiration two days either a day before expiration two days on< on an expiration date itself on an expiration date itself right< right so this way you're either going to right so this way you're either going to get< get close to the max profit or you're get close to the max profit or you're going< going to get close to the max loss so if going to get close to the max loss so if I< I bring up this graph again you can see I bring up this graph again you can see that that that chances< chances are if you're going to hold the chances are if you're going to hold the expiration< expiration it's either going to fall expiration it's either going to fall from< from this point on from this green line from this point on from this green line down< down here the max profit or from here so down here the max profit or from here so it's< it's either one of them it's either one of them now< now the next method right is to manage now the next method right is to manage your< your loss more aggressively and that is your loss more aggressively and that is to< to wait until 21 days to expiration and to wait until 21 days to expiration and close< close the trade regardless whether it's close the trade regardless whether it's a< a win or loss right now there is a lot a win or loss right now there is a lot of< of studies done by the tasty trade folks of studies done by the tasty trade folks right< right you can go to the website search right you can go to the website search for< for 21 DTE and you'll notice that they for 21 DTE and you'll notice that they did< did a lot of research on closing out did a lot of research on closing out option< option trades around 31 days of option trades around 31 days of expiration< expiration and they found that you can expiration and they found that you can actually< actually have an improved performance actually have an improved performance right< right that means overall you're going to right that means overall you're going to have< have a higher return if you are managing have a higher return if you are managing at< at 21 days to expiration so this way at 21 days to expiration so this way even< even though it is uh even though it is uh in< in the loss you're going to close it in in the loss you're going to close it in a< a win you're gonna close it small win a win you're gonna close it small win small< small loss 21 days to expiration you small loss 21 days to expiration you close< close it but what I prefer is actually close it but what I prefer is actually method< method four that means first of all I'll method four that means first of all I'll wait< wait to 21 days to expression and then wait to 21 days to expression and then I'll< I'll take a look where it is on the p l I'll take a look where it is on the p l graph< graph right so if it's outside of the graph right so if it's outside of the break-even< break-even I'm gonna close it for a loss break-even I'm gonna close it for a loss but< but if it's inside the break even I'm but if it's inside the break even I'm going< going to just hold it until I hit the 50 going to just hold it until I hit the 50 profit< profit or until it goes outside of the profit or until it goes outside of the break< break even then I'm just going to close break even then I'm just going to close it it it uh< uh for a loss right so I'm just gonna uh for a loss right so I'm just gonna give< give you an example of what I mean down give you an example of what. I mean down here< here let me just remove all this drawing here let me just remove all this drawing so< so you notice that my our shot put so you notice that my our shot put Sprite< Sprite is here and our break even is at Sprite is here and our break even is at this< this point right so generally anything this point right so generally anything past< past this break-even point I will past this break-even point I will consider< consider it as a loss anything above consider it as a loss anything above this< this break even Point there's still a this break even Point there's still a chance< chance for a profit now if you use the chance for a profit now if you use the 21< 21 DTE kind of a strategy where you just 21 DTE kind of a strategy where you just close< close it when it's 21 days to expression close it when it's 21 days to expression chances< chances are that if the market actually chances are that if the market actually lands< lands somewhere 180 right let's say it lands somewhere 180 right let's say it goes< goes 180 dollars you notice that it goes 180 dollars you notice that it shows< shows a loss right it's a loss all right shows a loss right it's a loss all right it's< it's below the zero line but the thing it's below the zero line but the thing is< is that it's still above our shot put is that it's still above our shot put strike< strike so that means there's still a strike so that means there's still a chance< chance for it to work out right it could chance for it to work out right it could still< still go out right so that is why I like still go out right so that is why I like to< to wait for it to see where it's at the to wait for it to see where it's at the 21< 21 DTE Mark so let's say at 21 DTA Mark 21 DTE Mark so let's say at 21 DTA Mark it's< it's at this point down here it's at this point down here what< what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna hold< hold it right I'm just gonna hold it hold it right I'm just gonna hold it because< because as time passes remember this uh because as time passes remember this uh graph< graph down here this p l purple line graph down here this p l purple line down< down here it will start to move up down here it will start to move up you'll< you'll start to gravitate all the way to you'll start to gravitate all the way to this< this point so it can actually become a this point so it can actually become a winner< winner or even better yet if the market winner or even better yet if the market starts< starts to go up after that then I'm starts to go up after that then I'm going< going to profit even quicker all right going to profit even quicker all right but< but the main thing is I'm trying to give but the main thing is I'm trying to give it< it a chance for the price to come back it a chance for the price to come back up< up right so this is the method which I up right so this is the method which I choose< choose and the only time I'll close it choose and the only time I'll close it is< is let's say it's 21 days to expiration is let's say it's 21 days to expiration it's< it's down here but then it's down here but then um< um a week later goes by and then it um a week later goes by and then it starts< starts to bridge this break-even point starts to bridge this break-even point the< the moment it breaks this brick uh Break the moment it breaks this brick uh Break Even< Even Point let's say it goes to around Even Point let's say it goes to around one< one seven five or something like that one seven five or something like that this< this at this point I know that as I hold this at this point I know that as I hold the< the trade right this p l graph down here the trade right this p l graph down here this< this purple line is going to start to this purple line is going to start to drop< drop down so you have to start to go drop down so you have to start to go down< down it's going to make me lose even down it's going to make me lose even more< more so this is where I will close the more so this is where I will close the trade< trade so that is how I manage my blue trade so that is how I manage my blue puts< puts brand and you want to choose one puts brand and you want to choose one where< where you feel comfortable with all where you feel comfortable with all right< right so I'm going to share with you right so I'm going to share with you some< some trade examples so the first trade some trade examples so the first trade example< example this is iwm which is the ishars example this is iwm which is the ishars at< at Russell 2000 ETF so on this day as at Russell 2000 ETF so on this day as you< you can see it is oversold you can see it is oversold right< right and it's oversold you can see down right and it's oversold you can see down here< here the stochastics so the market is here the stochastics so the market is going< going down so what I did is I placed uh going down so what I did is I placed uh the< the shot put spread at 175 and 170.

so the shot put spread at 175 and 170. so as< as you can see I was very fortunate as you can see I was very fortunate enough< enough that the market rallied right enough that the market rallied right after< after that and I managed to take my after that and I managed to take my profit< profit roughly one week plus right in 11 profit roughly one week plus right in 11 days< days so as you can see it's pretty quick days so as you can see it's pretty quick and< and here's the thing if you actually and here's the thing if you actually held< held it to expiration you decided to you held it to expiration you decided to you know< know you go for the method to hold to know you go for the method to hold to expiration< expiration then there's a chance that expiration then there's a chance that you< you might hit into a loss right because you might hit into a loss right because the< the market came down later on because the market came down later on because you< you did not take the profit but then you did not take the profit but then again< again if the market went all the way again if the market went all the way back< back up you could have gotten the full back up you could have gotten the full profit< profit whereas. I've only gotten 50 so profit whereas I've only gotten 50 so again< again we never know so it comes down to again we never know so it comes down to the< the mechanics that you want to choose the mechanics that you want to choose how< how you want to manage it and then you how you want to manage it and then you want< want to stick to it and then just just want to stick to it and then just just monitor< monitor the trades that you put on from monitor the trades that you put on from there there there all< all right trait number two again this is all right trait number two again this is iwm< iwm so iwm again on this day you can see iwm so iwm again on this day you can see that< that this is uh right after this trade that this is uh right after this trade which< which I put on the market became which I put on the market became oversold< oversold again right as you can see it's oversold again right as you can see it's oversold< oversold so at this point I'm looking to oversold so at this point I'm looking to put< put a shot put spread so the shot put put a shot put spread so the shot put spread< spread I put is roughly around 27.

25 spread I put is roughly around 27. 25 Deltas< Deltas around there so 160 155 Deltas around there so 160 155 and< and then this is uh basically what I and then this is uh basically what I mean< mean where you are not exactly right on mean where you are not exactly right on the< the direction but you still make money the direction but you still make money right< right so because when I put on the trade right so because when I put on the trade the< the market was around 170 right it was the market was around 170 right it was around< around 170 and you notice the market around 170 and you notice the market actually< actually dropped right dropped to actually dropped right dropped to roughly< roughly around one six maybe one six roughly around one six maybe one six three< three one six two and at this point it three one six two and at this point it was< was showing a loss but then because of was showing a loss but then because of the< the nature of this shot put spread of the nature of this shot put spread of the< the time as the market goes up the time as the market goes up and< and time Decay I managed to hit the 50 and time Decay I managed to hit the 50 take< take profit in 13 days take profit in 13 days now< now next I have another shot put spread now next I have another shot put spread example< example this is on spy all right spy example this is on spy all right spy again< again down here this is uh oversold again down here this is uh oversold again< again oversold down here so what I'm again oversold down here so what I'm looking< looking to do is put on a short put looking to do is put on a short put spread spread spread so< so a short put spread I want to put is so a short put spread I want to put is 360< 360 and 355 and I like to put this below 360 and 355 and I like to put this below the< the previous low as you can see this is the previous low as you can see this is the< the previous low so this way there's a the previous low so this way there's a chance< chance in case like you know if it hits chance in case like you know if it hits this< this there's some sort of a support it this there's some sort of a support it might< might bounce back up or at least this is might bounce back up or at least this is the< the thinking that I have when I put on the thinking that I have when I put on this< this trip right as long as you have the this trip right as long as you have the odds< odds against you right even though if odds against you right even though if you< you lose that's fine because you know you lose that's fine because you know that< that in the long term it's gonna work that in the long term it's gonna work out< out because you have things in your out because you have things in your favor< favor right you put it below a support favor right you put it below a support level< level or at a spot level and then the level or at a spot level and then the stochastics< stochastics is showing oversold right stochastics is showing oversold right definitely< definitely you want to do this that you definitely you want to do this that you know< know you want to put on a bullish trade know you want to put on a bullish trade when< when it's oversold rather than when it's when it's oversold rather than when it's overbought< overbought right so again overbought right so again try< try to put as many uh things in your try to put as many uh things in your favor< favor to make it work out right so as favor to make it work out right so as you< you can see in this trade again this is you can see in this trade again this is another< another example the trade where you're another example the trade where you're wrong< wrong with the direction as you can see wrong with the direction as you can see actually< actually blew past my long put strike actually blew past my long put strike for< for the credit spread but I still for the credit spread but I still managed< managed to take profit managed to take profit right< right much later no this is not 30 days right much later no this is not 30 days later< later this should be about 30 days later later this should be about 30 days later 30< 30 days this is a typo it took much 30 days this is a typo it took much later< later as you can see from here later as you can see from here at< at this point the market this is where I at this point the market this is where I put< put on at this this candle down here put on at this this candle down here when< when I put on this shot put spread the when I put on this shot put spread the market< market just went you know further down market just went you know further down right< right but at this point down here here's right but at this point down here here's the< the the beauty about this thing it has the the beauty about this thing it has not< not crossed the 21 days Mark when I put not crossed the 21 days Mark when I put on< on this shot put spread I think it's on this shot put spread I think it's around< around 50 something days 40 something or around 50 something days 40 something or 50< 50 something days and then at this point 50 something days and then at this point of< of time there was still more than 21 of time there was still more than 21 days< days so I wasn't looking to cut my trade days so I wasn't looking to cut my trade yet< yet right but if it's already past the yet right but if it's already past the 21< 21 days then I would be quite unlucky I 21 days then I would be quite unlucky I have< have no choice I would be cutting this have no choice I would be cutting this tray< tray down here for a loss according to tray down here for a loss according to my< my trade management style right so in my trade management style right so in this< this case it has not hit the 21 days it this case it has not hit the 21 days it was< was still still more than 21 days that was still still. more than 21 days that is< is why I held on to the trade is why I held on to the trade and< and then when it reached the 21 days it and then when it reached the 21 days it was< was still above my shot put strike so was still above my shot put strike so there's< there's no reason for me to close out there's no reason for me to close out the< the trade so I just held on until the 50 the trade so I just held on until the 50 was< was hit and it got hit uh a few days was hit and it got hit uh a few days later< later from here so overall the trade later from here so overall the trade roughly< roughly took about 30 plus days so this roughly took about 30 plus days so this way< way as you can see even though I am way as you can see even though I am wrong< wrong on the trade the direction it's wrong on the trade the direction it's still< still pretty forgiving because still pretty forgiving because I< I I have this spread on and I already I I have this spread on and I already have< have my trip Management in place so as have my trip Management in place so as the< the market bounce up I could take profit the market bounce up I could take profit by< by the way guys if this video has been by the way guys if this video has been helpful< helpful to you so far I'd really helpful to you so far I'd really appreciate< appreciate if you hit the thumbs up appreciate if you hit the thumbs up button< button and also share this to people button and also share this to people that< that you think will benefit from this that you think will benefit from this video< video and also subscribe to my channel video and also subscribe to my channel so< so this way you know I'll be motivated so this way you know I'll be motivated to< to create more videos like this for you to create more videos like this for you in< in the future all right back to the in the future all right back to the video< video alright so for the next flavor video alright so for the next flavor which< which is the bearish flavor of the which is the bearish flavor of the credit< credit spread you have the short call credit spread you have the short call spread< spread mechanics also known as the back spread mechanics also known as the back out< out spread so now basically this is just out spread so now basically this is just the< the opposite so whatever you have the opposite so whatever you have learned< learned from the shot put spread learned from the shot put spread mechanics< mechanics this is the opposite right so mechanics this is the opposite right so instead< instead of saying oversold you want to instead of saying oversold you want to wait< wait for it it's overbought instead of a wait for it it's overbought instead of a down< down day you want to wait for it until down day you want to wait for it until it's< it's an update so same thing 30 to 60 it's an update so same thing 30 to 60 days< days to expiration this is same 20 to 30 days to expiration this is same 20 to 30 Deltas< Deltas all this is the same whereas the Deltas all this is the same whereas the shot< shot put spread and your trade shot put spread and your trade management< management is the same as well so again management is the same as well so again you< you want to choose the method that you you want to choose the method that you feel< feel most comfortable with all right so feel most comfortable with all right so let's< let's get into a few examples and again let's get into a few examples and again this< this is on iwm so on this day this is on iwm so on this day you< you can see that the market you can see that the market right< right it wasn't update it was uh moving right it wasn't update it was uh moving up< up at this point I can see that the up at this point I can see that the market< market is overbought right so it's market is overbought right so it's overbought< overbought this is where I decided to overbought this is where I decided to put< put my short call spread so from here I put my short call spread so from here I put< put on a 190 strike 195 again Five put on a 190 strike 195 again Five Points< Points wide per contract Points wide per contract again< again position its size to your account again position its size to your account size size size so< so you can see on this day right again so you can see on this day right again pretty< pretty fortunate I got uh hit 50 uh 13 pretty fortunate I got uh hit 50 uh 13 days< days down here when the market uh went days down here when the market uh went down< down on this bar so I got my 50 so again down on this bar so I got my 50 so again as< as you can see after that the market as you can see after that the market actually< actually rallied so if you held this to actually rallied so if you held this to expiration expiration expiration uh< uh at this point you'll be still pretty uh at this point you'll be still pretty safe< safe because it hasn't hit the shot call safe because it hasn't hit the shot call a< a strike so what you want to do is a strike so what you want to do is manage< manage it according to the trade manage it according to the trade management< management style right so if it's time management style right so if it's time to< to cut loss you want to cut loss next to cut loss you want to cut loss next trade< trade example is on SMH now this is trade example is on SMH now this is another< another ETF this is on the semiconductor another ETF this is on the semiconductor ETF< ETF so on this day you can see the ETF so on this day you can see the market< market has rallied again it is market has rallied again it is overbought< overbought all right so again for this overbought all right so again for this what< what I'm looking out for is to place a what I'm looking out for is to place a trade< trade above the previous high so in this trade above the previous high so in this case< case would be the 250.

now you will case would be the 250. now you will notice< notice that the market actually is notice that the market actually is oversold< oversold at this point down here right oversold at this point down here right this< this candle down here is over bought this candle down here is over bought sorry< sorry it's already overbought sorry it's already overbought right< right but I did not place a trade here right but I did not place a trade here why< why because I wanted to place the 250 why because I wanted to place the 250 strike< strike which is above this point if I strike which is above this point if I were< were to place it right at this candle were to place it right at this candle what's< what's going to happen is that chances what's going to happen is that chances are< are this Delta is going to be maybe like are this Delta is going to be maybe like 10< 10 10 Deltas or 15 Deltas now 10 15 10 10 Deltas or 15 Deltas now 10 15 Deltas< Deltas what's going to happen is that Deltas what's going to happen is that although< although. you're going to have a higher although you're going to have a higher probability< probability a profit maybe it's like 85 probability a profit maybe it's like 85 maybe< maybe even 90 profit of a profit maybe even 90 profit of a profit probability< probability or profit the problem is probability or profit the problem is that< that you're going to receive very little that you're going to receive very little credit< credit right you're most likely going to credit right you're most likely going to receive< receive under a dollar right so what it receive under a dollar right so what it means< means is that if you're going to receive means is that if you're going to receive under< under a dollar you're gonna have to win under a dollar you're gonna have to win many< many more times in order to cover just many more times in order to cover just one< one loss right so I'd rather just wait one loss right so I'd rather just wait for< for this to go up and then place a trade for this to go up and then place a trade at< at 250.

so that means that at this point at 250. so that means that at this point in< in time I've already placed my credit in time I've already placed my credit spread< spread order and roughly around 1 to 150 spread order and roughly around 1 to 150 so< so the moment it goes up it will so the moment it goes up it will automatically< automatically fill my this credit spread automatically fill my this credit spread my< my short call spread and then I'll get my short call spread and then I'll get filled< filled so in this case I got fueled when filled so in this case I got fueled when the< the market was at this point which is the market was at this point which is pretty< pretty much closer to where this short pretty much closer to where this short strike< strike is so if you were to go for the strike is so if you were to go for the weekly< weekly option you will find that this is weekly option you will find that this is where< where your problem lies right so if where your problem lies right so if you're< you're going to go for the weekly option you're going to go for the weekly option chances< chances are that your 30 Deltas is going chances are that your 30 Deltas is going to< to get you somewhere around here maybe to get you somewhere around here maybe 240< 240 and it's going to be below this one 240 and it's going to. be below this one so< so it's going to be a little bit more so it's going to be a little bit more aggressive< aggressive so if you want to go for the aggressive so if you want to go for the 250< 250 if you're going for the weekly you 250 if you're going for the weekly you might< might want to wait for it to go a little might want to wait for it to go a little bit< bit higher and if it doesn't go higher bit higher and if it doesn't go higher and< and it goes down from here then you know and it goes down from here then you know you're< you're just gonna miss that trade right you're just gonna miss that trade right miss< miss the opportunity miss the opportunity all< all right so on with this trade so as all right so on with this trade so as you< you can see the market continued to go you can see the market continued to go up< up so in this case it never hit my short up so in this case it never hit my short strike< strike another case whereby I am wrong strike another case whereby I am wrong on< on the direction because from this point on the direction because from this point I< I place the short call spread it went up I place the short call spread it went up but< but it never hit my short strike at 250.

but it never hit my short strike at 250. eventually< eventually it went back down as you can eventually it went back down as you can see< see it hit my take profit 20 days later see it hit my take profit 20 days later all< all right so this is for the SMH and all right so this is for the SMH and finally< finally the third example is on CRM finally the third example is on CRM remember< remember I said that I generally do not remember I said that I generally do not like< like to trade on individual stocks but like to trade on individual stocks but during< during this time I had a number of

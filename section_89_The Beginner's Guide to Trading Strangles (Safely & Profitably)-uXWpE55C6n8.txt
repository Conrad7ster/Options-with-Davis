===============================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about how I we're going to be talking about how I trade< trade the short strangle so I'm going to trade the short strangle so I'm going to get< get into the entry the exit as well as get into the entry the exit as well as how< how I manage those trades now before I how I manage those trades now before I get< get into them the first thing that I get into them the first thing that I want< want to share with you is the want to share with you is the performance< performance of the last 100 trades that performance of the last 100 trades that I< I did for the strangle right so whenever I did for the strangle right so whenever you're< you're putting on any strategy it's you're putting on any strategy it's important< important to at least get a sample size important to at least get a sample size of< of a 100 trades or more then this way of a 100 trades or more then this way you'll< you'll be able to get a much better you'll be able to get a much better picture< picture of how the strategy is doing picture of how the strategy is doing right< right so many people you know make the right so many people you know make the mistake< mistake of just putting on five trades mistake of just putting on five trades or< or maybe even just 10 trades and then or maybe even just 10 trades and then think< think that you know that's going to think that you know that's going to decide< decide how the strategy is going to play decide how the strategy is going to play out< out in the future the most important out in the future the most important thing< thing is that. you do need a large sample thing is that you do need a large sample size< size right the more sample size that you size right the more sample size that you have< have the more the true probability of have the more the true probability of the< the strategy is going to play out over the strategy is going to play out over the< the long term okay so let's take a look the long term okay so let's take a look at< at some statistics down here so it's the at some statistics down here so it's the last< last 100 trades that I did so so as you last 100 trades that I did so so as you can< can see over here the win rate is can see over here the win rate is 79%< 79% which is somewhat in line with the 79% which is somewhat in line with the strangle< strangle strategy uh based on certain strangle strategy uh based on certain mechanics< mechanics which I'm going to share with mechanics which I'm going to share with you< you later on and then the loss rate you later on and then the loss rate basically< basically is 21% and then the average basically is 21% and then the average win< win as you can see is about win as you can see is about $27< $27 and the average loss is $27 and the average loss is $221< $221 which is slightly bigger than the $221 which is slightly bigger than the average< average win which is normal right average win which is normal right generally< generally your average loss for the generally your average loss for the strangle< strangle would always be bigger than strangle would always be bigger than your< your average win and if you're someone your average win and if you're someone that< that is interested in expectancy then that is interested in expectancy then the< the expectancy is about the expectancy is about $17. 12< $17.

12 right so basically the expectancy $17. 12 right so basically the expectancy is< is you know when you calculate it it is you know when you calculate it it kind< kind of tells you whether the strategy kind of tells you whether the strategy is< is you know profitable or not profitable is you know profitable or not profitable uh< uh based on the 100 trades right and uh based on the 100 trades right and this< this is what we kind of expect as it this is what we kind of expect as it move< move forward so again it's very move forward so again it's very important< important to put on at least a 100 important to put on at least a 100 trades< trades so for any strategy that you want trades so for any strategy that you want to< to put on the law of large numbers apply to put on the law of large numbers apply right< right the more traits that you have the right the more traits that you have the the< the more the probability will pretty the more the probability will pretty much< much show in the long term so for much show in the long term so for example< example if you were to just flip a coin example if you were to just flip a coin and< and unbiased coin has a 50% chance of and unbiased coin has a 50% chance of getting< getting hits of tail right but if you getting hits of tail right but if you were< were only to flip it five times and if were only to flip it five times and if you're< you're very lucky then it's very you're very lucky then it's very possible< possible that you know you could flip possible that you know you could flip hits< hits five times right then you might be hits five times right then you might be inclined< inclined to think that hey this coin is inclined to think that hey this coin is unbiased< unbiased right but is that really true unbiased right but is that really true now< now that's not true because if you were now that's not true because if you were to< to flip that coin for about 100 times a to flip that coin for about 100 times a thousand< thousand times 10,000 times then you thousand times 10,000 times then you will< will see that the uh probability of will see that the uh probability of getting< getting hits slowly start to go to the getting hits slowly start to go to the actual< actual mean of the probability which is actual mean of the probability which is about< about 50% so the same thing applies for about 50% so the same thing applies for this< this strategy down here so one thing this strategy down here so one thing very< very interesting for you to note down very interesting for you to note down here< here is that if you were just to take a here is that if you were just to take a look< look that the last oneir of the trades look that the last oneir of the trades that< that I've done this last onethird is that I've done this last onethird is actually< actually a negative right that means you actually a negative right that means you are< are actually in a loss after you place are actually in a loss after you place about< about 34 trades and many people right about 34 trades and many people right especially< especially if you come in during this especially if you come in during this time< time and you put on the strangle and you time and you put on the strangle and you have< have 34 trades or so and imagine that have 34 trades or so and imagine that this< this 34 trades have spent across maybe a this 34 trades have spent across maybe a couple< couple of months right maybe two three couple of months right maybe two three months< months or so and then at this point you months or so and then at this point you might< might be you know very demoralized might be you know very demoralized thinking< thinking that this strategy doesn't work thinking that this strategy doesn't work and< and you might just want to discard it and you might just want to discard it but< but if you have discarded it then you but if you have discarded it then you would< would have missed you know the other would have missed you know the other trades< trades that would in the end play out trades that would in the end play out the< the probability right so as you can see the probability right so as you can see down< down here the first 2/3 of the trades down here the first 2/3 of the trades will< will were actually pretty good right will were actually pretty good right they< they were all profitable in fact the they were all profitable in fact the probability< probability was a little bit way too probability was a little bit way too high< high for the strategy right you notice high for the strategy right you notice that< that among about 66 trades there's only that among about 66 trades there's only like< like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight losses so eight like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight losses so eight losses< losses out of 66 that is a very very losses out of 66 that is a very very high< high win rate but the strategy by itself high win rate but the strategy by itself does< does not actually have a very very high does not actually have a very very high win< win rate right the mean should be around win rate right the mean should be around 70< 70 odd perc so if you start to trade it 70 odd perc so if you start to trade it more< more slowly the probability will start more slowly the probability will start to< to show by itself so to show by itself so again< again uh this whole uh sample size down again uh this whole uh sample size down here< here is to show you the importance of at here is to show you the importance of at least< least putting on 100 trades or more in least putting on 100 trades or more in order< order for you to know the True order for you to know the True Performance< Performance of this strategy all right Performance of this strategy all right so< so this is the performance of the last so this is the performance of the last 100< 100 Trade so how did I actually enter 100 Trade so how did I actually enter exit< exit as well as manage my strangles to exit as well as manage my strangles to get< get this kind of performance so I'm get this kind of performance so I'm going< going to get into it right now so first going to get into it right now so first off< off if you're new to trading the off if you're new to trading the strangle< strangle the strangle is basically an strangle the strangle is basically an undefined< undefined risk strategy that cons undefined risk strategy that cons consist< consist of two naked positions right you consist of two naked positions right you have< have your short put as well as your have your short put as well as your short< short call so both of them are out of short call so both of them are out of the< the money now when I'm trading the the money now when I'm trading the strangle< strangle there are basically three strangle there are basically three different< different strangle types that I trade different strangle types that I trade right< right when I enter into the market it right when I enter into the market it depends< depends on you know the underlying depends on you know the underlying Market< Market condition and my view of the Market condition and my view of the underlying< underlying market right so this three underlying market right so this three strangle< strangle types the first one is the strangle types the first one is the neutral< neutral strangle so the neutral strangle neutral strangle so the neutral strangle for< for both the uh short put as well the for both the uh short put as well the short< short call is around 16 to 20 Deltas so short call is around 16 to 20 Deltas so basically< basically when you're trading this basically when you're trading this you're< you're trading What's called the you're trading What's called the expected< expected move so uh as you can see down expected move so uh as you can see down here< here this is a study done by the tasty here this is a study done by the tasty trade< trade team whereby they tested all the trade team whereby they tested all the different< different Delta for the strangle so as different Delta for the strangle so as you< you can see down here the one that I you can see down here the one that I usually< usually trade is somewhere around 16 to usually trade is somewhere around 16 to 20< 20 Delta and as you can see right this 20 Delta and as you can see right this strategy< strategy by itself even though if you go strategy by itself even though if you go somewhere< somewhere around 40 Deltas which is a somewhere around 40 Deltas which is a pretty< pretty high Delta that means your short pretty high Delta that means your short put< put and short call is much closer to put and short call is much closer to where< where the current market price. is so where the current market price is so let's< let's say for example this is a current let's say for example this is a current market< market price around 179 then your 40 market price around 179 then your 40 Deltas< Deltas might be somewhere around here Deltas might be somewhere around here right< right so this will be your short put right so this will be your short put this< this will be your short call so you this will be your short call so you actually< actually have a pretty narrow profit actually have a pretty narrow profit Zone< Zone but if you notice in the long term Zone but if you notice in the long term it's< it's actually still profitable right so it's actually still profitable right so this< this sample size or rather this uh test this sample size or rather this uh test which< which the tasty trade team have done is which the tasty trade team have done is over< over quite a number of years so in terms over quite a number of years so in terms of< of statistics is rather significant so of statistics is rather significant so as< as you can see down here the net p&amp;l per as you can see down here the net p&amp;l per trade< trade is all a positive right so that's trade is all a positive right so that's why< why again it's very important to put it why again it's very important to put it over< over the long term rather than just put over the long term rather than just put over< over two three trades or so because if I over two three trades or so because if I were< were to just go back to the table down were to just go back to the table down here< here you can see that I've actually here you can see that I've actually suffered< suffered you know about four to five suffered you know about four to five losses< losses in a row right let's just imagine losses in a row right let's just imagine that< that I didn't take this trade for some that I didn't take this trade for some reason< reason right and then I just went on reason right and then I just went on with< with this five trades you will see that with this five trades you will see that these< these are five losses in a row and the these are five losses in a row and the losses< losses are pretty big right you have a losses are pretty big right you have a loss< loss of total maybe up to 2,000 over loss of total maybe up to 2,000 over dollars< dollars so at this point in time you dollars so at this point in time you might< might be very demoralized thinking that might be very demoralized thinking that this< this strategy is not working but again this strategy is not working but again you< you know it's very important to just you know it's very important to just keep< keep on putting the trades over and over keep on putting the trades over and over again< again until the probability plays out so again until the probability plays out so uh< uh the one that I put for the neutral uh the one that I put for the neutral strangle< strangle is generally around 16 to 20 strangle is generally around 16 to 20 Delta< Delta so you can see that for them they Delta so you can see that for them they exit< exit at 21 DTE so for them is very exit at 21 DTE so for them is very mechanical< mechanical how they exit so they just mechanical how they exit so they just put< put on the strangle and whenever it's 21 put on the strangle and whenever it's 21 DTE< DTE they close that that and then they DTE they close that that and then they put< put it on again and based on the 16 to put it on again and based on the 16 to 20< 20 Delta the strangle they have a win 20 Delta the strangle they have a win rate< rate about 74 to 75% which is not too rate about 74 to 75% which is not too far< far off from the win rate which I got far off from the win rate which I got right< right so my win rate is about 79% is right so my win rate is about 79% is slightly< slightly higher and one of the main slightly higher and one of the main reasons< reasons is because uh on my trades I reasons is because uh on my trades I also< also tend to take profit slightly also tend to take profit slightly earlier< earlier than the 21 DTE depending on the earlier than the 21 DTE depending on the situation< situation which I'm going to share with situation which I'm going to share with you< you again right but basically you can you again right but basically you can see< see the probability is somewhere around see the probability is somewhere around there< there so this is for the neutral there so this is for the neutral strangle< strangle now the other strangle that I strangle now the other strangle that I put< put on is what I call the bullish put on is what I call the bullish strangle< strangle that means that if I think that strangle that means that if I think that the< the market might be going up then I the market might be going up then I might< might choose to go for a more bullish might choose to go for a more bullish strangle< strangle whereby I'm pretty much just strangle whereby I'm pretty much just shifting< shifting the whole strangle structure shifting the whole strangle structure upwards< upwards right so as you can see down upwards right so as you can see down here< here this is the neutral so let me just here this is the neutral so let me just remove< remove the drawing so what I'm going to remove the drawing so what I'm going to do< do with the bullish triangle is that I do with the bullish triangle is that I pretty< pretty much just shift this to upwards pretty much just shift this to upwards right< right so as you can see down here this right so as you can see down here this is< is the bullish triangle now the bullish is the bullish triangle now the bullish triangle< triangle for the short putut I'll be triangle for the short putut I'll be slightly< slightly more aggressive with the delta slightly more aggressive with the delta Del< Del so it's more than 20 Delta so Del so it's more than 20 Delta so sometimes< sometimes I go for 20 to 25 to 30 35 sometimes I go for 20 to 25 to 30 35 depending< depending on you know how bullish I am depending on you know how bullish I am in< in the market and then for the short in the market and then for the short call< call I tend to put it slightly further call I tend to put it slightly further away< away right so it's about 5 to 15 Delta away right so it's about 5 to 15 Delta now< now the last triangle that I put on now the last triangle that I put on would< would be the bearish triangle so if I would be the bearish triangle so if I think< think that the market is going to go think that the market is going to go down< down based on you know the Market's down based on you know the Market's movement< movement if I think like for example if movement if I think like for example if it's< it's over exhausted to the upside the it's over exhausted to the upside the market< market has gone up quite a lot then I market has gone up quite a lot then I might< might just choose to put on a bearish might just choose to put on a bearish strangle< strangle so in which case now the short strangle so in which case now the short call< call will be more than 20 deltas and the call will be more than 20 deltas and the short< short put will be somewhere 5 to 15 short put will be somewhere 5 to 15 Delta< Delta so basically I'm now Shifting the Delta so basically I'm now Shifting the structure< structure downwards so these are the structure downwards so these are the three< three different types of strangle that three different types of strangle that you< you can also put on now next let's get you can also put on now next let's get into< into the exit Rules by the way if you into the exit Rules by the way if you like< like this video so far Please Subscribe like this video so far Please

com blueprint all options with davis. com blueprint all right< right back to the video so I have a few right back to the video so I have a few rules< rules when I trade the short strangle rules when I trade the short strangle and< and these rules are going to be pretty and these rules are going to be pretty strict< strict mainly also because this is an strict mainly also because this is an undefined< undefined risk strategy so with an undefined risk strategy so with an undefined< undefined risk strategy if you don't undefined risk strategy if you don't manage< manage it properly then it's very easy manage it properly then it's very easy for< for you to get you know huge losses that for you to get you know huge losses that you< you may not even recover from so as much you may not even recover from so as much as< as possible I always want to manage my as possible I always want to manage my risk< risk very well so the very first rule is risk very well so the very first rule is that< that my latest exit will be around 21 that my latest exit will be around 21 DTE< DTE in terms of time right so as you can DTE in terms of time right so as you can see< see down here this study over here is see down here this study over here is done< done by the tasty trade team as well done by the tasty trade team as well where< where they compare two management style where they compare two management style right< right the first is you exit at 21 DTE right the first is you exit at 21 DTE which< which they call it managing earlier and which they call it managing earlier and the< the other one is if you exit at the other one is if you exit at exporation< exporation so in both cases they're both exporation so in both cases they're both profitable< profitable it's just that when you exit profitable it's just that when you exit at< at 21 DTE your per performance is better at 21 DTE your per performance is better right< right because you also tend to limit right because you also tend to limit your< your losses so there are times whereby your losses so there are times whereby the< the market can go all the way in One the market can go all the way in One Direction< Direction and if you hold all the way to Direction and if you hold all the way to expiration< expiration then that's a time where you expiration then that's a time where you could< could suffer a pretty big loss could suffer a pretty big loss especially< especially as you can see down here especially as you can see down here during< during Market crashes this was during during Market crashes this was during 2008< 2008 2009 during the subprime crisis so 2008 2009 during the subprime crisis so this< this is time where the market really this is time where the market really crashed< crashed and as you can see if you held crashed and as you can see if you held all< all the way to expiration your draw down all the way to expiration your draw down would< would be bigger than if you were to exit would be bigger than if you were to exit 21< 21 DTE so for myself this is a rule that 21 DTE so for myself this is a rule that I< I always hold on to now the next rule is I always hold on to now the next rule is that< that I also choose to take profit at 50% that I also choose to take profit at 50% right< right so for my rule will be either 50% right so for my rule will be either 50% or< or 21 DTE for some of my trades right or 21 DTE for some of my trades right some< some of my trades I will do this and some of my trades I will do this and some< some of my trades I will just leave it some of my trades I will just leave it to< to 21 DTE so whenever I'm trading the to 21 DTE so whenever I'm trading the strangle< strangle I tend to have a few positions strangle I tend to have a few positions on< on at the same time and as you can see on at the same time and as you can see down< down here this is the study done by the down here this is the study done by the tasty< tasty trade team on the different tasty trade team on the different management< management styles as well so previous management styles as well so previous table< table I showed you just only the 21 DTE table I showed you just only the 21 DTE as< as well as the expiration now for this as well as the expiration now for this they< they have two other management style so they have two other management style so the< the first one is the combo so the combo the first one is the combo so the combo is< is basically 50% takeprofit or 21 DTE is basically 50% takeprofit or 21 DTE whichever< whichever comes first now the winner is whichever comes first now the winner is basically< basically 50% take profit or expiration basically 50% take profit or expiration and< and then the one that is earlier is and then the one that is earlier is basically< basically managing at 21 DTE that means basically managing at 21 DTE that means you< you exit at 21 DTE and finally the last you exit at 21 DTE and finally the last one< one is to exit at expiration so as you one is to exit at expiration so as you can< can see as long as you do exit your can see as long as you do exit your trade< trade at expiration right you you tend trade at expiration right you you tend to< to have a better results if you choose to have a better results if you choose one< one of the other ones now the third exit one of the other ones now the third exit rule< rule is that if there are multiple rule is that if there are multiple positions< positions with the same DTE then I'll positions with the same DTE then I'll generally< generally stagger my exits right so generally stagger my exits right so here's< here's what I mean so let's say for here's what I mean so let's say for example< example I have three strangles on and example I have three strangles on and all< all of them have the same DTE which is all of them have the same DTE which is currently< currently at around 23 DTE so at this currently at around 23 DTE so at this point< point what I'll choose to do is that I point what I'll choose to do is that I might< might just close out one of them first might just close out one of them first right< right I'll close out one of them first right I'll close out one of them first at< at 23 DTE left and then just leave the at 23 DTE left and then just leave the remaining< remaining two then the next day comes remaining two then the next day comes and< and then both of them becomes 22 DTE at and then both of them becomes 22 DTE at this< this point I'll close out one more and this point I'll close out one more and then< then finally on the last uh strangle then finally on the last uh strangle position< position which I have which is at 21 DTE position which I have which is at 21 DTE this< this is when I'll close out the final this is when I'll close out the final trade< trade so when I do it this way I pretty trade so when I do it this way I pretty much< much am smoothing my p&amp;l as well as I'm much am smoothing my p&amp;l as well as I'm diversifying< diversifying my trade as well because diversifying my trade as well because you< you know I might not know what's going you know I might not know what's going to< to happen the next day right for example to happen the next day right for example what< what if the market suddenly crashes the what if the market suddenly crashes the next< next day if the market crashes next day next day if the market crashes next day then< then I have all three positions all of a then I have all three positions all of a sudden< sudden taking a very big hit so if I had sudden taking a very big hit so if I had actually< actually exited some of the positions actually exited some of the positions first< first then I'm going to take hit on you first then I'm going to take hit on you know< know only a couple or just one position know only a couple or just one position which< which is not that bad right so all I'm which is not that bad right so all I'm doing< doing down here is as much as possible doing down here is as much as possible I'm< I'm trying to diversify my exits as well I'm trying to diversify my exits as well as< as smoothen my p&amp;l now the very last as smoothen my p&amp;l now the very last exit< exit rule that I have is if the loss exit rule that I have is if the loss exceeds< exceeds the initial buying power exceeds the initial buying power requirement< requirement for putting on the trade requirement for putting on the trade then< then I I close the trade so again this then I I close the trade so again this is< is because this is an undefined risk is because this is an undefined risk strategy< strategy so if you were to take a look strategy so if you were to take a look down< down here it says your max loss is down here it says your max loss is negative< negative Infinity basically what it negative Infinity basically what it means< means is that if. the underline goes to means is that if the underline goes to zero< zero you could lose a lot more than you zero you could lose a lot more than you know< know what you have in your trading know what you have in your trading account< account so that is why it's very account so that is why it's very important< important to manage your max risk for important to manage your max risk for any< any undefined risk trade so for the any undefined risk trade so for the strangle< strangle as long as it hits the buying strangle as long as it hits the buying power< power effect that I put on for the trade power effect that I put on for the trade so< so for example as you can see down here so for example as you can see down here this< this buying power effect or buying power this buying power effect or buying power requirement< requirement both are pretty much the requirement both are pretty much the same< same term so as long as it hits this same term so as long as it hits this amount< amount that I used to put on for the amount that I used to put on for the trade< trade in the first place that means I trade in the first place that means I use< use this Capital to open up this trade use this Capital to open up this trade I'm< I'm going to exit it right so this is a I'm going to exit it right so this is a non-negotiable< non-negotiable rule this is as much as non-negotiable rule this is as much as possible< possible not to let any single trade possible not to let any single trade wipe< wipe out my account okay so especially wipe out my account okay so especially when< when the market crashes this is the time when the market crashes this is the time where< where you really need to be on your toes where you really need to be on your toes to< to see hey has your loss already reached to see hey has your loss already reached the< the uh initial buying power requirement the uh initial buying power requirement if< if it has then it's time to just close if it has then it's time to just close the< the trade so these are the four exit the trade so these are the four exit rules< rules that I have now finally let's get rules that I have now finally let's get into< into trade management so trade into trade management so trade management< management basically just involves management basically just involves rolling< rolling right so I only decide whether rolling right so I only decide whether to< to roll if either of my short strikes to roll if either of my short strikes are< are tested right I do not roll if my are tested right I do not roll if my short< short strikes are not tested as much as short strikes are not tested as much as possible< possible I don't really want to roll and possible I don't really want to roll and just< just keep this Max profit Zone down here just keep this Max profit Zone down here the< the same width it's only when I get the same width it's only when I get tested< tested on either side then I choose to tested on either side then I choose to roll< roll or not now if I do roll I only roll roll or not now if I do roll I only roll the< the untested side so this is very the untested side so this is very important< important to understand so for example important to understand so for example if< if I'm tested on the put side then I if I'm tested on the put side then I will< will generally want to roll down my call will generally want to roll down my call option< option okay and if I'm tested on the option okay and if I'm tested on the call< call side then I'll be rolling up my put call side then I'll be rolling up my put option< option so I do not roll the tested side option so I do not roll the tested side so< so some people have asked before you so some people have asked before you know< know saying hey Davis you know if I've know saying hey Davis you know if I've got< got tested on the call side can I just got tested on the call side can I just roll< roll this further away so this way what roll this further away so this way what happens< happens is that your profit zone now happens is that your profit zone now becomes< becomes wider because you had your becomes wider because you had your original< original uh short putut let's say your original uh short putut let's say your original< original shot putut was here then you original shot putut was here then you have< have a much wider profit Zone compared have a much wider profit Zone compared to< to uh the previous one when you first to uh the previous one when you first put< put it on and the answer is that I don't put it on and the answer is that I don't really< really do this is because when you roll really do this is because when you roll this< this short call up what happens is that this short call up what happens is that you're< you're actually going to pay a debit you're actually going to pay a debit right< right if you pay a debit that means right if you pay a debit that means you're< you're increasing the risk and reducing you're increasing the risk and reducing your< your credit on your uh trade so then is your credit on your uh trade so then is why< why I do not roll the tested side I only why I do not roll the tested side I only roll< roll the untested side next if I have roll the untested side next if I have multiple< multiple positions I will only roll some multiple positions I will only roll some and< and leave the rest to diversify and and leave the rest to diversify and smoothen< smoothen my p&amp;l as well so let's say for smoothen my p&amp;l as well so let's say for example< example if I have say um two positions example if I have say um two positions two< two strangles that has been tested on two strangles that has been tested on the< the call side then what I could do is the call side then what I could do is that< that one of them I will actually roll that one of them I will actually roll the< the put and on the other one I'm not the put and on the other one I'm not going< going to roll it I'm just going to leave going to roll it I'm just going to leave it< it and the reason is because I I want to it and the reason is because I I want to prepare< prepare for the the uh possibility that prepare for the the uh possibility that in< in case the market comes back down I in case the market comes back down I don't< don't want it to come down and test both don't want it to come down and test both my< my strangles right because if I had not my strangles right because if I had not actually< actually wrote them then I would have actually wrote them then I would have been< been in a very good profit zone right so been in a very good profit zone right so let's< let's say for example the original one let's say for example the original one is< is this right so right now I can have is this right so right now I can have two< two strangles one I wrote and one I left two strangles one I wrote and one I left it< it so if the market actually comes down it so if the market actually comes down then< then this one that I wrote down here is then this one that I wrote down here is most< most likely going to be now back into a most likely going to be now back into a loss< loss right because it came down too far loss right because it came down too far and< and it tested the put strike that I and it tested the put strike that I rolled< rolled to but I have another one which I rolled to but I have another one which I didn't< didn't roll so this one will now nicely didn't roll so this one will now nicely be< be in a profit so in this case I'm be in a profit so in this case I'm diversifying< diversifying my p&amp;l as well all right so diversifying my p&amp;l as well all right so this< this is how I trade the short strangle this is how I trade the short strangle and< and if you found this video helpful I and if you found this video

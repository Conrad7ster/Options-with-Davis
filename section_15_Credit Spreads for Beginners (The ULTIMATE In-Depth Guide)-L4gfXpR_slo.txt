guide and this is for spreads trading guide and this is for you< you if you are a beginner right so if you if you are a beginner right so if you're< you're just starting out into trading you're just starting out into trading options< options then this is definitely the options then this is definitely the guide< guide for you or if you are you know new guide for you or if you are you know new to< to credit spreads that means you have to credit spreads that means you have been< been trading options for quite some time been trading options for quite some time but< but you have never really dealt into but you have never really dealt into spreads< spreads then this is going to be good spreads then this is going to be good for< for you as well because I'm going to go for you as well because I'm going to go in< in depth into some of the topics right in depth into some of the topics right so< so for this video here is the table of so for this video here is the table of content< content so first of all I'm going to get content so first of all I'm going to get into< into what exactly are credit spreads and into what exactly are credit spreads and also< also why you should trade credit spreads also why you should trade credit spreads and< and how to enter into a credit spread and how to enter into a credit spread how< how to exit a credit spread and more how to exit a credit spread and more importantly< importantly how to manage a losing importantly how to manage a losing credit< credit spread so this is one of the most credit spread so this is one of the most important< important topic that a lot of people important topic that a lot of people actually< actually ask about because inevitably actually ask about because inevitably when< when you enter into one of this credit when you enter into one of this credit spreads< spreads sooner or later you will spreads sooner or later you will definitely< definitely have positions that is like definitely have positions that is like in< in a draw down so this is at a point you in a draw down so this is at a point you know< know where you really need to know how know where you really need to know how to< to manage it properly all right so are to manage it properly all right so are you< you ready if you're ready please get a you ready if you're ready please get a pen< pen and a paper as well so you can start pen and a paper as well so you can start taking< taking some notes as we go through this taking some notes as we go through this video< video all right so let's dive into the video all right so let's dive into the very< very first one so what exactly are very first one so what exactly are credit< credit spreads so credit spreads are credit spreads so credit spreads are short< short option strategies which is the short option strategies which is the opposite< opposite of long option strategies that opposite of long option strategies that gives< gives you a credit Upfront for putting gives you a credit Upfront for putting on< on a trade so this is one of those terms on a trade so this is one of those terms where< where where you hear you know people say where where you hear you know people say it< it pretty often when they're trading it pretty often when they're trading options< options and that is selling premium so options and that is selling premium so if< if somebody tell you that they are if somebody tell you that they are selling< selling premium then you know that they selling premium then you know that they are< are trading basically short option are trading basically short option strategies< strategies where you receive a credit strategies where you receive a credit upfront< upfront so this is opposite to Long upfront so this is opposite to Long option< option strategies so long option option strategies so long option strategies< strategies for example the most basic strategies for example the most basic one< one is to buy a call option right so one is to buy a call option right so basically< basically we've buying a call option basically we've buying a call option what< what you do is that you have to you know what you do is that you have to you know out< out the funds first to put on the out the funds first to put on the trade< trade and then once you sell it you see trade and then once you sell it you see you< you know what's the price differential you know what's the price differential now< now sh option strategies is the opposite now sh option strategies is the opposite where< where you receive the credit up front where you receive the credit up front first< first right now this credit which you first right now this credit which you receive< receive is actually put into your receive is actually put into your training< training account immediately right and training account immediately right and you< you can actually use it right so for you can actually use it right so for example< example if I were to sell a credit example if I were to sell a credit spread< spread for spread for a133< a133 it just means that I will be a133 it just means that I will be receiving receiving receiving $133< $133 into my trading account right so $133 into my trading account right so let's< let's say for example if my trading let's say for example if my trading account< account let's say I start off with account let's say I start off with $5,000< $5,000 now after I sell this credit $5,000 now after I sell this credit spread< spread you'll notice that your account spread you'll notice that your account suddenly< suddenly now becomes suddenly now becomes $5,000< $5,000 $133 right so you have $5,000 $133 right so you have $533< $533 but what you need to understand is $533 but what you need to understand is that< that. although that they have given you that although that they have given you the< the credit $133 they actually hold a the credit $133 they actually hold a certain< certain amount of money for you to put certain amount of money for you to put on< on the trade right this is what you call on the trade right this is what you call the< the buying power reduction so here's a the buying power reduction so here's a very< very important thing to understand when very important thing to understand when you< you put on this credit spread it doesn't you put on this credit spread it doesn't mean< mean that you've already profited on the mean that you've already profited on the trade< trade while the premium has already been trade while the premium has already been credited< credited to your account now the p&amp;l of credited to your account now the p&amp;l of the< the trade will only be finalized when the trade will only be finalized when the< the trade has ended and what do I mean the trade has ended and what do I mean by< by ended ended just means that either by ended ended just means that either you< you have already closed out your trade you have already closed out your trade or< or you wait until it expires so every or you wait until it expires so every option< option has an expiration date so either option has an expiration date so either one< one of them right either you close it one of them right either you close it out< out or until the trade expires that is out or until the trade expires that is when< when the trade has ended and then you when the trade has ended and then you see< see your p&amp;l so your final amount may see your p&amp;l so your final amount may not< not necessarily be this not necessarily be this $513< $513 that you receive up front right so $513 that you receive up front right so this< this is the balance which you have once this is the balance which you have once you< you put on the trade now once the trade you put on the trade now once the trade closes< closes it really depends on whether you closes it really depends on whether you have< have made or lost right if let's say for have made or lost right if let's say for example< example you made the full profit on a example you made the full profit on a trade< trade right the trade maybe expired out trade right the trade maybe expired out of< of the money then this will be your of the money then this will be your finalized< finalized amount but if you actually finalized amount but if you actually let's< let's say for example you only made $33 let's say for example you only made $33 on< on the trade right let's say you receive on the trade right let's say you receive $133< $133 but based on the trade when you $133 but based on the trade when you closed< closed it out you only made $33 so what closed it out you only made $33 so what it< it means is that your account now will it means is that your account now will only< only show only show $533< $533 now what if you lost right if you $533 now what if you lost right if you lost< lost this amount could actually dropped lost this amount could actually dropped below< below $5,000 so how do you know exactly below $5,000 so how do you know exactly what< what is your max loss so you can take a what is your max loss so you can take a look< look down here this is the order ticket look down here this is the order ticket for< for T trade now it depends on what for T trade now it depends on what platform< platform that you're using but all the platform that you're using but all the platforms< platforms should actually show you platforms should actually show you what's< what's the max loss on your trade so as what's the max loss on your trade so as you< you can see down here for this you can see down here for this particular< particular trade the max loss is particular trade the max loss is $367< $367 so you actually lost money on the $367 so you actually lost money on the trade< trade then you'll see that your account trade then you'll see that your account will< will drop to around 4,000 something will drop to around 4,000 something right< right so it depends on exactly how much right so it depends on exactly how much you< you lose so again don't think that you lose so again don't think that because< because you receed the money up front because you receed the money up front that< that is yours for you to keep right now that is yours for you to keep right now right< right you still have to wait until the right you still have to wait until the trade< trade actually closes now next how do trade actually closes now next how do you< you tell whether you are in a profit or you tell whether you are in a profit or a< a loss right because this is where a lot a loss right because this is where a lot of< of uh beginners when they just get of uh beginners when they just get started< started into trading credit option started into trading credit option strategies< strategies or any short option strategies or any short option strategies< strategies they get a little bit strategies they get a little bit confused< confused right because most of the time confused right because most of the time when< when they get into you know trading or when they get into you know trading or rather< rather if they came from the outright rather if they came from the outright trading< trading World they are used to seeing trading World they are used to seeing you< you know the current price higher than you know the current price higher than where< where they first bought it at so let's where they first bought it at so let's say< say for example if you bought it at a say for example if you bought it at a dollar< dollar and then let's say the buck is dollar and then let's say the buck is showing< showing you a showing you a $1. 50< $1.

50 right this is in terms of let's $1. 50 right this is in terms of let's say< say debit strategies let's say you say debit strategies let's say you bought< bought a debit strategy or maybe you buy bought. a debit strategy or maybe you buy a< a call option for a dollar and now this a call option for a dollar and now this call< call option is worth $1.

50 then now you call option is worth $1. 50 then now you know< know that you have made 50 cents right know that you have made 50 cents right so< so remember one contract controls a 100 so remember one contract controls a 100 of< of the underlying shares so it just of the underlying shares so it just means< means that you have made about $50 right means that you have made about $50 right $50< $50 for 50 cents profit right 50 cents $50 for 50 cents profit right 50 cents profit< profit is equals to $50 so this is where profit is equals to $50 so this is where many< many people get confused because when many people get confused because when you're< you're trading credit spreads it's you're trading credit spreads it's actually< actually the opposite right now right actually the opposite right now right you< you want to see the opposite what you you want to see the opposite what you want< want to see is that you want the number want to see is that you want the number to< to be lower than where you sold it at to be lower than where you sold it at right< right so let me just remove this drawing right so let me just remove this drawing down< down here so for example if you sold it down here so for example if you sold it at at at a133< a133 uh like the last example that I a133 uh like the last example that I show< show you what you want to see on the show you what you want to see on the mark< mark which is the current price of what mark which is the current price of what you're< you're trade is to be lower than a133 so you're trade is to be lower than a133 so for< for example if it's at a dollar then you for example if it's at a dollar then you know< know that you have made 33 cents so to know that you have made 33 cents so to profit< profit on a trade you have to buy back profit on a trade you have to buy back lower< lower than when you sold it and it's a lower than when you sold it and it's a loss< loss if you buy back higher than when loss if you buy back higher than when you< you sold it right that will be a loss so you sold it right that will be a loss so as< as you can see down here there's an as you can see down here there's an example< example so again this is on the tasty example so again this is on the tasty trade< trade uh platform so as you can see on trade uh platform so as you can see on the< the left hand side this is where you the left hand side this is where you know< know I sold the trade for right as you know I sold the trade for right as you can< can see down here it says trade price so can see down here it says trade price so you< you notice that it's sold for you notice that it's sold for $252< $252 and right now it's currently $252 and right now it's currently marking< marking that means the current price is marking that means the current price is at< at a187 so for this trade it's in a at a187 so for this trade it's in a profit< profit so as you can see it shows $65 profit so as you can see it shows $65 now< now for the one below you notice that now for the one below you notice that it's it's it's a138< a138 at where the trade price is that a138 at where the trade price is that when< when you open up the trade now it's when you open up the trade now it's marking< marking for $157 which means to say marking for $157 which means to say you're< you're in a loss right so remember if you're in a loss right so remember if you're< you're trading credit spreads when you're trading credit spreads when you're< you're looking at your position step you're looking at your position step what< what you want to see is that the mark what you want to see is that the mark the< the current price is lower than when you the current price is lower than when you first< first sold it then you know that you're first sold it then you know that you're in< in a profit now next there are two types in a profit now next there are two types of< of credit spreads right so credit of credit spreads right so credit spreads< spreads come in two flavors so we are spreads come in two flavors so we are talking< talking it as though it's like an ice talking it as though it's like an ice cream< cream or something like that so you have cream or something like that so you have the< the bullish flavor and that is the put the bullish flavor and that is the put credit< credit spread also known as The Bull put credit spread also known as The Bull put spread< spread so you want to choose the put spread so you want to choose the put. credit< credit spread if you are bullish on the credit spread if you are bullish on the market< market if you think the market is going market if you think the market is going to< to go up then this is where you want to to go up then this is where you want to put< put on a put credit spread so how do you put on a put credit spread so how do you put< put on the put credit spread so it's put on the put credit spread so it's actually< actually very simple right to put on the actually very simple right to put on the put< put credit spread there's just two put credit spread there's just two options< options that you have to put on right options that you have to put on right the< the first one is the short put that you the first one is the short put that you have< have to put on right so as you can see have to put on right so as you can see down< down here this is the short putut and down here this is the short putut and what< what you want to do is you want to what you want to do is you want to generally< generally put it out of the money right generally put it out of the money right so< so for the put option out of the money so for the put option out of the money just< just means that it's below where the just means that it's below where the current< current market price is so as you can current market price is so as you can see< see down here the current market price see down here the current market price is< is around 194 so out of the money just is around 194 so out of the money just means< means it's below right and the next means it's below right and the next option< option that you want to put on is the option that you want to put on is the long< long put option so you want to buy this long put option so you want to buy this below< below where your short put is and this below where your short put is and this is< is where it actually defines your risk is where it actually defines your risk defines< defines your max loss right so in this defines your max loss right so in this case< case if the market actually goes way case if the market actually goes way past< past or even if the stock goes all the past or even if the stock goes all the way< way to zero you cannot lose more than way to zero you cannot lose more than where< where you place this long put option at where you place this long put option at right< right so what it does is to really limit right so what it does is to really limit your< your loss so when you're training the your loss so when you're training the credit< credit spread it's important that you credit spread it's important that you put< put this two together at the same time put this two together at the same time rather< rather than you know you spread them out rather than you know you spread them out right< right some people like to put on the right some people like to put on the short< short put first and then later on put on short put first and then later on put on the< the long put and generally you don't the long put and generally you don't really< really want to do that because you get really want to do that because you get into< into legging race so you want to put into legging race so you want to put these< these two together at the same time in these two together at the same time in one< one order ticket okay so this is for the one order ticket okay so this is for the put< put credit spread now if you are bearish put credit spread now if you are bearish on< on the underlying Market that means you on the underlying Market that means you think< think that the market is going to go think that the market is going to go down< down then you want to put on what is down then you want to put on what is called< called the call Credit spread also known called the call Credit spread also known as< as the bare call spread so the bare call as the bare call spread so the bare call spread< spread consists of two call options spread consists of two call options right< right one of them is the short call right one of them is the short call option< option and again you want to put this option and again you want to put this out< out of the money and for the calls out out of the money and for the calls out of< of the money is basically above where of the money is basically above where the< the current market price is so you can the current market price is so you can see< see the current market price again is see the current market price again is n4.

7< n4. 7 so anything that is out of the n4.

7 so anything that is out of the money< money for the call site is above where money for the call site is above where the< the market price is so for this you want the market price is so for this you want to< to sell an out of money call option and to sell an out of money call option and then< then you want to buy a call option then you want to buy a call option further< further out of the money right so this further out of the money right so this is< is above where the shot call is and is above where the shot call is and again< again same thing this is what you call again same thing this is what you call the< the width of the call spread that means the width of the call spread that means this< this is how wide your call spread is and this is how wide your call spread is and your< your loss is also limited to where this your loss is also limited to where this long< long call option is that means if the long call option is that means if the market< market let's say for example it shoots market let's say for example it shoots to< to the Moon again you only can lose up to the Moon again you only can lose up to< to the point whereby where you place to the point whereby where you place your< your call option right your long call your call option right your long call option< option so this is also one of the things option so this is also one of the things you< you know why people say that you know you know why people say that you know selling< selling a naked call option is very selling a naked call option is very dangerous< dangerous why because let's say for dangerous why because let's say for example< example you do not have this call option example you do not have this call option down< down here then if the market really down here then if the market really shoots< shoots all the moon then guess what you shoots all. the moon then guess what you can< can keep losing money as the market can keep losing money as the market keeps< keeps going higher if you do not have keeps going higher if you do not have this< this long call option so when you have this long call option so when you have this< this long call option in place this this long call option in place this actually< actually protects you to the upside so actually protects you to the upside so again< again very important you have to put again very important you have to put this< this two at the same time rather than this two at the same time rather than you< you L them in because you could get into you L them in because you could get into legging< legging risk now next how do you know legging risk now next how do you know what< what is the max profit for a credit what is the max profit for a credit spread< spread now if you were to just buy a spread now if you were to just buy a very< very simple you know call option right a very simple you know call option right a long< long call option strategy then your max long call option strategy then your max profit< profit is basically unlimited right profit is basically unlimited right because< because if the market just keeps going because if the market just keeps going up< up then you can just keep profiting on up then you can just keep profiting on the< the call option right but for the credit the call option right but for the credit spread< spread it's very different it's the spread it's very different it's the opposite< opposite right for credit spreads your opposite right for credit spreads your max< max profit is actually already kept max profit is actually already kept right< right and it's kept to the credit that right and it's kept to the credit that you< you receive at the start so for example you receive at the start so for example Le< Le this I sold this credit spread at Le this I sold this credit spread at $1. 33< $1.

33 what it just means is that your $1. 33 what it just means is that your max< max profit is actually this is max profit is actually this is $133< $133 per credit spread that you put on $133 per credit spread that you put on right< right so if you're not sure uh exactly right so if you're not sure uh exactly what< what is the max profit all you have to what is the max profit all you have to do< do again you just pull up your order do again you just pull up your order ticket< ticket right your order ticket as you ticket right your order ticket as you can< can see it shows can see it shows $133< $133 now how do you know what is your $133 now how do you know what is your max< max loss so the max loss is actually max loss so the max loss is actually also< also pretty simple to calculate all you also pretty simple to calculate all you have< have to do is first you have to know have to do is first you have to know what< what is the width of your spread so as what is the width of your spread so as you< you can see down here the width of the you can see down here the width of the spread< spread is $5 wide $5 wide so against for spread is $5 wide $5 wide so against for each< each contract that you put on it each contract that you put on it controls< controls 100 shares so that's $500 $500 controls 100 shares so that's $500 $500 loss< loss minus the credit that you receive loss minus the credit that you receive so< so in this case it's $500 minus so in this case it's $500 minus $133< $133 and that's where you get the max $133 and that's where you get the max loss< loss of loss of $367< $367 so this is pretty simple to $367 so this is pretty simple to calculate< calculate right if you don't want to calculate right if you don't want to calculate< calculate this by yourself of course calculate this by yourself of course just< just go ahead to take a look at the just go ahead to take a look at the order< order ticket now this is something that order ticket now this is something that you< you have to understand with a trading you have to understand with a trading credit< credit spread right some people will be credit spread right some people will be asking< asking you know if the risk to reward asking you know if the risk to reward ratio< ratio is so bad why do want to trade the ratio is so bad why do want to trade the credit< credit spread because if you notice your credit spread because if you notice your max< max profit is max profit is $133< $133 but your max loss is $133 but your max loss is $367< $367 so in a sense whereby every time $367 so in a sense whereby every time when< when you lose the max loss you need when you lose the max loss you need quite< quite a number of the max profit in quite a number of the max profit in order< order for you to recover that loss right order for you to recover that loss right so< so I'm pretty sure you're asking that so I'm pretty sure you're asking that question< question right and the reason why you question right and the reason why you want< want to trade a credit spread and want to trade a credit spread and something< something that not many people actually something that not many people actually notice< notice is the profit probability right notice is the profit probability right the< the probability of profit down here as the probability of profit down here as you< you can see it's 60% right most of the you can see it's 60% right most of the time< time when you put on a normal uh trading time when you put on a normal uh trading strategy< strategy let's say for example like if strategy let's say for example like if you< you go to outright trading you just buy you go to outright trading you just buy a< a share that would be a 50% probability a share that would be a 50% probability right< right because the moment where you first right because the moment where you first buy< buy the seles for example the stock is buy the seles for example the stock is down< down here this is where the current down here this is where the current price< price is the moment where you. buy at price is the moment where you buy at this< this point down here there's a 50% this point down here there's a 50% chance< chance of whether you make money or loss chance of whether you make money or loss right< right because if it goes up 50% of the right because if it goes up 50% of the time< time you make goes down 50% of the time time you make goes down 50% of the time you< you lose money now of course we don't you lose money now of course we don't want< want to take into you know the fact that want to take into you know the fact that maybe< maybe you have some strategy that is maybe you have some strategy that is going< going to work out in the long term where going to work out in the long term where you< you know you have an edge in technical you know you have an edge in technical analysis< analysis let's put that all aside for analysis let's put that all aside for now< now let's just take a look simply at now let's just take a look simply at Price< Price Right simply at Price when you Price Right simply at Price when you enter< enter at this point down here there's a enter at this point down here there's a 50%< 50% it will go up 50% it will go down 50% it will go up 50% it will go down that< that is why it's a 50% win rate strategy that is why it's a 50% win rate strategy now< now for the credit spread is very now for the credit spread is very different< different right so if you take a look at different right so if you take a look at this< this put credit spread as an example you this put credit spread as an example you notice< notice that the current price is here notice that the current price is here but< but your p credit spread is below here but your p credit spread is below here right< right so what does this mean it means right so what does this mean it means that< that if the market actually comes down that if the market actually comes down and< and let's say for example at this point and let's say for example at this point it< it expires right it expires that mean it expires right it expires that mean the< the trade has finalized so do you the trade has finalized so do you actually< actually win or lose money at this point actually win or lose money at this point well< well the answer is that you actually well the answer is that you actually made< made money on this trade because made money on this trade because although< although it has gone down it did not go although it has gone down it did not go below< below your this short putut strike so below your this short putut strike so anything< anything that is above your short put anything that is above your short put strike< strike at expiration it's a profit so strike at expiration it's a profit so what< what you notice down here which is very what you notice down here which is very different< different from you know outright trading different from you know outright trading if< if the market goes down you could if the market goes down you could actually< actually still be in profit right so actually still be in profit right so that< that is why there is the higher that is why there is the higher probability< probability of profit now the other probability of profit now the other thing< thing to understand is that some people thing to understand is that some people actually< actually calculate expectancy right that actually calculate expectancy right that means< means they will take the probability of means they will take the probability of win< win times the average uh profit and then win times the average uh profit and then the< the minus of the probity of loss times the minus of the probity of loss times the< the average loss now you don't want to the average loss now you don't want to use< use the numbers down here to calculate use the numbers down here to calculate your< your expectancy because it's not your expectancy because it's not accurate< accurate right because it's not definite accurate right because it's not definite that< that let's say for example you see 60% that let's say for example you see 60% is< is profit it's not that 60% of the time is profit it's not that 60% of the time right< right 0.

6 or rather 60% all right let me right 0. 6 or rather 60% all right let me just< just remove all this drawing to make it just remove all this drawing to make it much< much clearer it doesn't mean that 60% of much clearer it doesn't mean that 60% of the< the time you will definitely make the time you will definitely make $133< $133 and doesn't mean that 40% of the $133 and doesn't mean that 40% of the time< time when you lose you will be time when you lose you will be guaranteed< guaranteed a guaranteed a $367< $367 loss no it's not like that right $367 loss no it's not like that right because< because there are varying profit levels because there are varying profit levels and< and varying loss level the trade may be and varying loss level the trade may be for< for example a profit of only you know for example a profit of only you know $100< $100 at one point at one time or maybe $100 at one point at one time or maybe your< your next trade could be $50 profit only your next trade could be $50 profit only right< right so you need to take the average of right so you need to take the average of that< that and also the loss as well right so that and also the loss as well right so let< let me put a minus down here to be clear let me put a minus down here to be clear so< so it's not every time you lose the max so it's not every time you lose the max profit< profit right the only time you can lose profit right the only time you can lose the< the max profit is if the market Market the max profit is if the market Market goes< goes all the way down here and at goes all the way down here and at expiration< expiration right this trade closes below expiration right this trade closes below this< this long put option right only at this long put option right only at expiration< expiration if you close up before that expiration if you close up before that it< it may not necessarily be a Max loss so it may not necessarily be a Max loss so this< this is something I'm going to be this is something I'm going to be talking< talking about later on how to actually talking about later on how to actually exit< exit the trade because not all the time exit the trade because not all the time you< you actually want to exit at expiration you actually want to exit at expiration right< right that's where you know quite a right that's where you know quite a number< number of uh new Traders make the number of uh new Traders make the mistake< mistake right they think that they have mistake right they think that they have to< to hold the trade all the way to to hold the trade all the way to expiration< expiration so it's either you make some expiration so it's either you make some money< money the pro Max profit or the max loss money the pro Max profit or the max loss right< right right that's not true right so the right right that's not true right so the only< only time you can lose money on this only time you can lose money on this trade< trade is if the max loss is realized at trade is if the max loss is realized at expiration< expiration where the market is below expiration where the market is below this< this long put strike now there are times this long put strike now there are times whereby< whereby it actually doesn't go below whereby it actually doesn't go below this< this long putut strike for example it this long putut strike for example it could< could go out down here and it expires could go out down here and it expires right< right so if it expires down here this is right so if it expires down here this is where< where it settles at you notice. it's not where it settles at you notice it's not below< below this long put strike down here if below this long put strike down here if it's< it's not below this long put strike you it's not below this long put strike you actually< actually do not realize the max loss actually do not realize the max loss right< right it's somewhere in between so that right it's somewhere in between so that is< is why it's important to not calculate is why it's important to not calculate you< you know your win and loss or the you know your win and loss or the probability< probability of whether you make money or probability of whether you make money or CR< CR sprads based on this number here you CR sprads based on this number here you actually< actually have to trade them out and actually have to trade them out and based< based on your numbers you calculate based on your numbers you calculate exactly< exactly what is that expectancy now exactly what is that expectancy now that's< that's the other thing I want to talk that's the other thing I want to talk about< about is in terms of this probability of about is in terms of this probability of profit< profit how you actually increase this profit how you actually increase this probability< probability of profit it depends on how probability of profit it depends on how far< far away you are from the current market far away you are from the current market right< right so for example this is the put right so for example this is the put credit< credit spread let's use this example credit spread let's use this example again< again so so let's say at this point of again so so let's say at this point of time< time let's say this is a 60% win rate uh time let's say this is a 60% win rate uh probability< probability in terms of uh this uh put probability in terms of uh this uh put credit< credit spread now for you to increase credit spread now for you to increase this< this win rate all you have to do is this win rate all you have to do is actually< actually push this put credit spread actually push this put credit spread down< down that means instead of selling this down that means instead of selling this put< put credit spread here you're selling put credit spread here you're selling your< your put credit spread down here instead your put credit spread down here instead right< right you have a much further away put right you have a much further away put credit< credit spread then from here your win credit spread then from here your win rate< rate will increase maybe it could go all rate will increase maybe it could go all the< the way to 75% or 80% depending on how the way to 75% or 80% depending on how far< far away the market is so for those who far away the market is so for those who want< want very high win rate you might be want very high win rate you might be inclined< inclined to actually put your put spread inclined to actually put your put spread very< very far away from the market this way very far away from the market this way you< you get to win most of the time right you get to win most of the time right but< but don't forget that it's actually a but don't forget that it's actually a tradeoff< tradeoff right the trade-off is that tradeoff right the trade-off is that although< although your probability of profit may although your probability of profit may increase< increase but your risk reward ratio increase but your risk reward ratio actually< actually becomes even worse right your actually becomes even worse right your risk< risk reward ratio may now become where risk reward ratio may now become where your< your max profit is only 50 and then your your max profit is only 50 and then your max< max loss is $4.

50 in terms of a five $5 max loss is $4. 50 in terms of a five $5 WID< WID spread right which means to say your WID spread right which means to say your max< max loss is $450 your max profit is $50 max loss is $450 your max profit is $50 so< so this is the trade-off guys right if so this is the trade-off guys right if you< you want a higher win rate you have to you want a higher win rate you have to settle< settle for a lower profit but a higher settle for a lower profit but a higher Max< Max loss so the whole idea down here is Max loss so the whole idea down here is not< not to think of something like what is not to think of something like what is the< the best credit spread to put on but the best credit spread to put on but rather< rather you know you want to find a good rather you know you want to find a good balance< balance between both of them so in terms balance between both of them so in terms of< of a credit spread what is a good of a credit spread what is a good balance< balance so that is what I'm going to balance so that is what I'm going to touch< touch on in the later slides but for now touch on in the later slides but for now the< the next thing I want to touch on is why the next thing I want to touch on is why Trade< Trade Credit spreads right so I'm going Trade Credit spreads right so I'm going to< to give you a few reasons well the first to give you a few reasons well the first reason< reason is that you don't have to be reason is that you don't have to be right< right on the direction and you can still right on the direction and you can still be< be profitable right like I mentioned be profitable right like I mentioned earlier< earlier if the market actually comes earlier if the market actually comes down< down and it expires down here you're down and it expires down here you're actually< actually still in a profit right you actually still in a profit right you notice< notice that you are wrong in the notice that you are wrong in the direction< direction right you think that the direction right you think that the market< market is going to go up but instead the market is going to go up but instead the market< market went down but because it didn't market went down but because it didn't go< go low enough past your this short foot go low enough past your this short foot strike< strike it expired out of the money strike it expired out of the money you're< you're still in profit right so this is you're still in profit right so this is The< The Edge actually you have compared to The Edge actually you have compared to you< you know just outright trading where you know just outright trading where it's< it's 50% short or even just buying a it's 50% short or even just buying a long< long call which is the worst way to long call which is the worst way to actually< actually get into a bullish uh trade actually get into a bullish uh trade right< right you definitely do not want to just right you definitely do not want to just go< go into a long outof the money call so go into a long outof the money call so to< to be profitable on a credit spread you to be profitable on a credit spread you don't< don't necessarily have to be 100% right don't necessarily have to be 100% right on< on the direction you just have to not be on the direction you just have to not be severely< severely wrong on the direction right severely wrong on the direction right you< you can be still wrong on the direction you can be still wrong on the direction just< just make sure that you're not so wrong just make sure that you're not so wrong that< that goes all the way past down there that goes all the way past down there all< all right so this is the first reason all right so this is the first reason now< now the next reason is that it actually now the next reason is that it actually has< has a high win rate compared to outright has a high win rate compared to outright trading< trading or even just buying out of money trading or even just buying out of money call< call options right so as you can see call options right so as you can see down< down here the win rate is very high so down here the win rate is very high so this< this is a study done by the tasty trade this is a study done by the tasty trade research< research team where they tested the 20 research team where they tested the 20 Delta< Delta put spread right the 20 Delta put Delta put spread right the 20 Delta put credit< credit spread as you can see down here credit spread as you can see down here the< the win rate is pretty impressive right the win rate is pretty impressive right you< you have for a dollar one $5 wide $10 you have for a dollar one $5 wide $10 wide< wide so regardless how wide it is you wide so regardless how wide it is you can< can see the win rate is above 90% for can see the win rate is above 90% for most< most of them right you can see it's most of them right you can see it's pretty< pretty pretty high so this is the kind pretty pretty high so this is the kind of< of win rate that you cannot get in of win rate that you cannot get in outright< outright trading or even just buying an outright trading or even just buying an outright< outright call option right out of the outright call option right out of the money< money call option so if you want to win money call option so if you want to win more< more often than you lose then definitely more often than you lose then definitely you< you want to go for the credit spread now you want to go for the credit spread now the< the next reason is that it's. easier to the next reason is that it's easier to construct< construct a credit spread compared to construct a credit spread compared to other< other option strategies like the iron other option strategies like the iron condo< condo the butterfly and then the boken condo the butterfly and then the boken wing< wing butterfly right because the curent wing butterfly right because the curent spread< spread only has two legs right you only spread only has two legs right you only have< have the short leg which is the first have the short leg which is the first one< one you normally should want to put on one you normally should want to put on and< and then you have the long strike the and then you have the long strike the long< long put option right for the put spread long put option right for the put spread right< right so this as you can see is the put right so this as you can see is the put option< option the put credit spread the call option the put credit spread the call Credit< Credit spread is just the same as well Credit spread is just the same as well you< you have two strikes as well but you have two strikes as well but basically< basically for credit spreads there's basically for credit spreads there's just< just two strikes for you to handle right just two strikes for you to handle right to< to manage very very simple easy to to manage very very simple easy to construct< construct and the next and very construct and the next and very important< important reason is that it has limited important reason is that it has limited risk< risk right the risk is kept to what you risk right the risk is kept to what you define< define as the risk at the start unlike define as the risk at the start unlike undefined< undefined risk strategies let's say for undefined risk strategies let's say for example< example if you put a short put if the example if you put a short put if the market< market keeps going down then you're market keeps going down then you're going< going to keep losing money as the market going to keep losing money as the market goes< goes down similar to the strangle or the goes down similar to the strangle or the put< put ratio spread as well but if you have put ratio spread as well but if you have a< a credit spread on or in this case the a credit spread on or in this case the put< put cage spread on your max loss is kept put cage spread on your max loss is kept basically< basically to where the long strike is so basically to where the long strike is so that< that means the market can you know just that means the market can you know just go< go all the way to zero you still won't go all the way to zero you still won't lose< lose more than whatever you RIS on this lose more than whatever you RIS on this trade< trade which is up to this point down trade which is up to this point down here< here so it's very good for you to get here so it's very good for you to get started< started especially you know if you're started especially you know if you're new< new to trading options and finally it's new to trading options and finally it's a< a very great way to get started if you a very great way to get started if you have< have a small starting Capital right have a small starting Capital right maybe< maybe you don't have that much funds or maybe you don't have that much funds or maybe< maybe if you're just starting out just maybe if you're just starting out just to< to test trading options you can to test trading options you can definitely< definitely Trade Credit spreads right definitely Trade Credit spreads right credit< credit spreads is not Capital intensive credit spreads is not Capital intensive and< and you can put on a trade for as little and you can put on a trade for as little as< as maybe about I would say about $300 to as maybe about I would say about $300 to $400< $400 on a trade based on you know a $5 $400 on a trade based on you know a $5 wide< wide spread right so if this is a $5 wide spread right so if this is a $5 wide< wide spread and according to the example wide spread and according to the example I< I shared with you earlier right let's I shared with you earlier right let's say< say you receive say you receive $133< $133 or $133 cents for this credit then $133 or $133 cents for this credit then your< your max loss is only 367 right that your max loss is only 367 right that means< means you only have to put up means you only have to put up $367< $367 per trade for this uh trade to for $367 per trade for this uh trade to for you< you to put it on right so if you have a you to put it on right so if you have a small< small account this is perfect for you small account this is perfect for you you< you now let's get into how you're going you now let's get into how

com blueprint over to options with davis. com blueprint all< all right back to the video so I'm going all right back to the video so I'm going to< to give you a few simple steps to get to give you a few simple steps to get started< started started so if you have a pen and started started so if you have a pen and paper< paper this is time for you to write it paper this is time for you to write it down< down so the very first step is to pick a down so the very first step is to pick a direction< direction right remember the credit direction right remember the credit spread< spread comes in two flavors you have the spread comes in two flavors you have the bullish< bullish flavor which is the bull put bullish flavor which is the bull put spread< spread and you have the bearish flavor spread and you have the bearish flavor which< which is the bare call spread so you which is the bare call spread so you have< have to first decide whether you know have to first decide whether you know you< you think the market is going to go up you think the market is going to go up or< or down so if you bullish then go with or down so if you bullish then go with the< the put credit spread right also known the put credit spread right also known as< as the bullo spread now if you're not as the bullo spread now if you're not good< good at you know reading charts or good at you know reading charts or technical< technical analysis then one simple way technical analysis then one simple way for< for for you to get started is just by for for you to get started is just by using< using what is called the stochastic using what is called the stochastic oscillator< oscillator right the stochastic oscillator right the stochastic oscillator< oscillator or the RSI so basically these oscillator or the RSI so basically these are< are indicators that just help you are indicators that just help you indicate< indicate whether the market is indicate whether the market is overbought< overbought oversold right so anything overbought oversold right so anything below< below this line down here is considered below this line down here is considered oversold< oversold and anything above this line oversold and anything above this line down< down here is considered overbought right down here is considered overbought right so< so uh as a general rule of thumb if the so uh as a general rule of thumb if the market< market goes to a point where it's over market goes to a point where it's over sold< sold right that mean it dips below this sold right that mean it dips below this line< line down here then this will be the line down here then this will be the time< time where you you can consider putting time where you you can consider putting on< on a put credit spread where you want to on a put credit spread where you want to get< get a little bit more bullish rather get a little bit more bullish rather than< than bearish now one thing to understand than bearish now one thing to understand again< again and and I explained this in many again and and I explained this in many of< of my videos when I talk about the of my videos when I talk about the stochastic< stochastic oscillator is that this is stochastic oscillator is that this is not< not some kind of a miracle or magic not some kind of a miracle or magic indicator< indicator right it's not like every time indicator right it's not like every time when< when it's oversold the market will when it's oversold the market will definitely< definitely bounce up right there'll be definitely bounce up right there'll be times< times where you know the indicator shows times where you know the indicator shows it's< it's oversold and the market continues it's oversold and the market continues to< to go down right that happens right you to go down right that happens right you just< just need to understand that just need to understand that strategically< strategically speaking if you want to strategically speaking if you want to put< put on a bullish spread do you think put on a bullish spread do you think it's< it's smarter for us to put it on when it's smarter for us to put it on when the< the market shows that it's oversold or the market shows that it's oversold or when< when it's overbought right so generally when it's overbought right so generally we< we want to be you know a little bit we want to be you know a little bit smarter< smarter when it comes to you know smarter when it comes to you know placing< placing bullish or bearish strategies so placing bullish or bearish strategies so this< this at least will help us you know put this at least will help us you know put the< the odds in our favor so one simple way the odds in our favor so one simple way just< just take a look at the stochastic just take a look at the stochastic oscillator< oscillator if it's over soap then you oscillator if it's over soap then you can< can start to uh think about putting on can start to uh think about putting on the< the put credit spread maybe this is the put credit spread maybe this is where< where you might take a look at where the where you might take a look at where the support< support is this is where you can start support is this is where you can start to< to look into putting on a put credit to look into putting on a put credit spread< spread and if you're bearish then you spread and if you're bearish then you can< can go with the call Credit spread so can go with the call Credit spread so basically< basically same thing if you're not sure basically same thing if you're not sure when< when is a good time to put on the call when is a good time to put on the call Credit< Credit spread then just take a look at Credit spread then just take a look at the< the indicator right the stochastic the indicator right the stochastic indicator< indicator or the RSI once it's indicator or the RSI once it's overbought< overbought then you can start to overbought then you can start to consider< consider putting on a cold cred spread consider putting on a cold cred spread maybe< maybe somewhere up here right so you can maybe somewhere up here right so you can see< see the market has already gone up quite see the market has already gone up quite high< high so at this point of time it looks a high so at this point of time it looks a little< little bit exhausted at the same time little bit exhausted at the same time there's< there's some resistance down here so I there's some resistance down here so I would< would say that you know putting a call would say that you know putting a call Credit< Credit spread above this line down here Credit spread above this line down here you< you know would be pretty strategic at you know would be pretty strategic at the< the same time you. can see it's the same time you can see it's overbought< overbought right so this is how you overbought right so this is how you would< would pick a direction now some people would pick a direction now some people have< have asked me hey Davis what is your have asked me hey Davis what is your setting< setting for stochastics so I already setting for stochastics so I already mentioned< mentioned this in another video you just mentioned this in another video you just go< go to my channel and search for go to my channel and search for stochastic< stochastic and there you'll find a video stochastic and there you'll find a video where< where I already just go into how you set where I already just go into how you set it< it up on your chart now next step number it up on your chart now next step number two< two is to choose your DTE so DTE just two is to choose your DTE so DTE just stands< stands for days to expiration so as you stands for days to expiration so as you can< can see there are many different can see there are many different expiration< expiration dates for you to choose from expiration dates for you to choose from on< on this uh option chain so how do you on this uh option chain so how do you decide< decide which DTE now some people like to decide which DTE now some people like to go< go very shortterm right because they go very shortterm right because they think< think that you know by going very think that you know by going very shortterm< shortterm you can get slightly higher shortterm you can get slightly higher premium< premium in terms of percentage return is premium in terms of percentage return is higher< higher and also you know you can you higher and also you know you can you know< know sell the cred spread more often know sell the cred spread more often that< that means let's say for example if you that means let's say for example if you choose< choose something like 12 DTE 12 days choose something like 12 DTE 12 days gone< gone past you put on another one again gone past you put on another one again right< right but for me personally I prefer to right but for me personally I prefer to go< go for a longer term one around 45 DTE go for a longer term one around 45 DTE that< that is because Studies have already that is because Studies have already shown< shown that you have an edge when you go shown that you have an edge when you go around< around the 45 DTE so if you want to have around the 45 DTE so if you want to have an< an edge in the long term then I will go an edge in the long term then I will go for< for somewhere around 45 to 65 DTE so for somewhere around 45 to 65 DTE so what< what is this Edge right so as you can what is this Edge right so as you can see< see down here this is a study done by see down here this is a study done by the< the tasty trade team again so they have the tasty trade team again so they have uh< uh studied the difference between the uh studied the difference between the expected< expected and the realized move uh for expected and the realized move uh for quite< quite a number of years as you can see quite a number of years as you can see this< this St is since 1993 so this a pretty this St is since 1993 so this a pretty statistical< statistical significant kind of a test statistical significant kind of a test set< set what you have to understand down set what you have to understand down here< here is that when we're trading short here is that when we're trading short options< options a lot of time right we want the options a lot of time right we want the fact< fact that the expected move has to be fact that the expected move has to be greater< greater than the realized move that is greater than the realized move that is where< where our Edge is right so if you're not where our Edge is right so if you're not very< very familiar with this expected move I very familiar with this expected move I suggest< suggest you go to my channel right I suggest you go to my channel right I already< already created a video very in-depth on already created a video very in-depth on it< it and why we want to use that as our it and why we want to use that as our Edge< Edge when we're trading options right Edge when we're trading options right the< the video is called the number one the video is called the number one secret< secret to becoming consistently secret to becoming consistently profitable< profitable trading options I'll put the profitable trading options I'll put the link< link at the top right hand corner of link at the top right hand corner of this< this video you haven't already watched this video you haven't already watched that< that now when we are trading options we that now when we are trading options we want< want to always ensure that the expected want to always ensure that the expected move< move is greater than the realized move move is greater than the realized move so< so this way we know that we have an edge so this way we know that we have an edge right< right but if you notice down here if we right but if you notice down here if we choose< choose the days that is below 45 days choose the days that is below 45 days right< right you can see that anywhere from 30 right you can see that anywhere from 30 days< days all the way to 7 Days down here days all the way to 7 Days down here that< that they have shown there's no Edge that they have shown there's no Edge right< right you can see the question question right you can see the question question down< down here they ask is expected bigger down here they ask is expected bigger than< than realized the answer is no right if than realized the answer is no right if it's< it's no it just means that we don't have it's no it just means that we don't have the< the edge here but whereas from 45 days the edge here but whereas from 45 days onwards< onwards all right as you can see down onwards all right as you can see down here< here 45 all the way to 90 days you see here 45 all the way to 90 days you see that< that the expected move is it bigger than that the expected move is it bigger than the< the realiz and the answer is yes it the realiz and the answer is yes it shows< shows that you actually have an edge shows that you actually have an edge when< when we are trading the longer term DTE when we are trading the longer term DTE right< right so you can see down here average right so you can see down here average expected< expected move for the 45 days is 5.

#### Topic 1

7% so expected move for the 45 days is 5. 7% so this< this is what the market expects it will this is what the market expects it will move< move in the next say 45 days but the move in the next say. 45 days but the average< average realized move that it actually average realized move that it actually happened< happened that means the actual move is happened that means the actual move is only< only 5.

2% that means it move actually only 5. 2% that means it move actually slightly< slightly smaller than the expected move slightly smaller than the expected move and< and this is important for us when we're and this is important for us when we're trading< trading you know short option strategies trading you know short option strategies because< because we do not want the market to because we do not want the market to move< move that much right we want the move that much right we want the underlying< underlying to stay as small as possible underlying to stay as small as possible or< or in the direction of our trade in in or in the direction of our trade in in this< this case for our credit spreads right this case for our credit spreads right so< so for example if you put on a put so for example if you put on a put credit< credit spread we want it to go up right credit spread we want it to go up right all< all the way up or if it doesn't go up at all the way up or if it doesn't go up at least< least you know don't move that much least you know don't move that much against< against us so when you have this Edge against us so when you have this Edge then< then at least when you put on a put then at least when you put on a put credit< credit spread or call Credit spread more credit spread or call Credit spread more often< often of the time the trade will work often of the time the trade will work out< out for us rather than it not working out for us rather than it not working out< out and let's say if it does go against out and let's say if it does go against us< us at least it won't go that far right us at least it won't go that far right so< so that is why I prefer to choose around so that is why I prefer to choose around 45< 45 to 65 days I don't like to go any 45 to 65 days I don't like to go any further< further out than that because if you go further out than that because if you go too< too far out then Theta is not really too far out then Theta is not really going< going to kick in right so we want time going to kick in right so we want time Decay< Decay to work on our side so anytime Decay to work on our side so anytime between< between 45 to 65 days would be good now between 45 to 65 days would be good now step< step number three and that is to decide step number three and that is to decide on< on your short Delta so when you're on your short Delta so when you're putting< putting on a crit spread the very first putting on a crit spread the very first thing< thing you have to decide on is the short thing you have to decide on is the short strike< strike right so if you're doing the put strike right so if you're doing the put crit< crit spread you have to decide on your crit spread you have to decide on your short< short put if you're doing the call short put if you're doing the call Credit< Credit spread you have to decide on the Credit spread you have to decide on the short< short call option so for here if you short call option so for here if you have< have a strong conviction on the have a strong conviction on the underlying< underlying Direction go for a higher underlying Direction go for a higher Delta< Delta so in this example we are using Delta so in this example we are using the< the put credit spread as an example so the put credit spread as an example so that< that means that you want to go somewhere that means that you want to go somewhere from< from around 40 Deltas to 30 Deltas if from around 40 Deltas to 30 Deltas if you're< you're pretty strong and your conviction you're pretty strong and your conviction right< right and if you're not that strong if right and if you're not that strong if you're< you're a little bit more conservative you're a little bit more conservative you< you want a higher win rate then you go you want a higher win rate then you go anywhere< anywhere around 30 to you know 20 Delta anywhere around 30 to you know 20 Delta something< something like that right remember again something like that right remember again there's< there's always a trade-off right if you there's always a trade-off right if you go< go for like 20 Delta now of course go for like 20 Delta now of course you're< you're going to win more often of the you're going to win more often of the time< time but whenever you have a loss it's time but whenever you have a loss it's going< going to be pretty big as well so it's a going to be pretty big as well so it's a trade-off< trade-off so for me I think somewhere trade-off so for me I think somewhere good< good would be around 30 Deltas that's good would be around 30 Deltas that's also< also uh where the tasty trade team the also uh where the tasty trade team the research< research team have done most of the research team have done most of the tests< tests right they've done a lot of tests tests right they've done a lot of tests regarding< regarding the 30 Delta so as you can see regarding the 30 Delta. so as you can see down< down here this put spread test which down here this put spread test which they< they have done is if I'm not mistaken they have done is if I'm not mistaken it's< it's around 30 Deltas or so right this it's around 30 Deltas or so right this is< is a put spread strategy so as you can is a put spread strategy so as you can see< see down here they did a test for $5 see down here they did a test for $5 wide< wide $10 wide and they also tested it at wide $10 wide and they also tested it at expiration< expiration and also where they exit the expiration and also where they exit the trade< trade early right where you exit the trade early right where you exit the trade< trade early basically it just means they trade early basically it just means they exit< exit at 21 DTE right it means that exit at 21 DTE right it means that there's< there's 21 days left until the there's 21 days left until the expiration< expiration of the option then they take expiration of the option then they take off< off the trade right as you can see in off the trade right as you can see in both< both cases it's still profitable right both cases it's still profitable right you< you can see the annual rooc but what you you can see the annual rooc but what you notice< notice that if you were to manage notice that if you were to manage earlier< earlier you get a slightly lower win earlier you get a slightly lower win rate< rate right but your annual return is rate right but your annual return is slightly< slightly higher and again as you can see slightly higher and again as you can see down< down here this is another test which down here this is another test which they< they did and you can see in the long they did and you can see in the long term< term this is for the put credit spread term this is for the put credit spread you< you actually have an edge in the market you actually have an edge in the market right< right because the market keeps going up right because the market keeps going up and< and you're putting on a bullish trade and you're putting on a bullish trade now< now of course you're going to be now of course you're going to be profitable< profitable on it in the long term but profitable on it in the long term but how< how profitable there are two ways right how profitable there are two ways right you< you have the 21 DTE and you have the one you have the 21 DTE and you have the one where< where you hold all the way to expiration where you hold all the way to expiration right< right but basically for this is when right but basically for this is when you're< you're choosing your short Delta you you're choosing your short Delta you want< want to choose something where you're want to choose something where you're comfortable< comfortable with right if you want more comfortable with right if you want more credit< credit go for a higher Delta if you want credit go for a higher Delta if you want a< a higher win rate go for a slightly a higher win rate go for a slightly lower< lower Delta now step number four once lower Delta now step number four once you've< you've already decided on your short you've already decided on your short option< option how do you define the long option option how do you define the long option right< right this is what is called Define your right this is what is called Define your long< long wings so the way to do it is to long wings so the way to do it is to base< base it on your max risk per trade so base it on your max risk per trade so the< the very first thing you want to do the very first thing you want to do before< before you enter into trade is you need before you enter into trade is you need to< to decide you know what is the max risk to decide you know what is the max risk you< you want to risk for the trade so let's you want to risk for the trade so let's say< say for example youve decided that $500 say for example youve decided that $500 is< is the max risk you want to put on the is the max risk you want to put on the trade< trade so the first thing you would do is trade so the first thing you would do is just< just go five point wi first right just just go five point wi first right just go< go 5 point wi first and then start to go 5 point wi first and then start to construct< construct it from there as a starting construct it from there as a starting point< point then adjust it right so let's say point then adjust it right so let's say for< for example you put on a $5 wide put for example you put on a $5 wide put spread< spread in this case and you see that the spread in this case and you see that the premium< premium which you receive premium which you receive is125< is125 now if you were to take a look at is125 now if you were to take a look at the< the max loss the max loss is actually the max loss the max loss is actually only only only $3.

75< $3. 75 which is $3.

75 which is $375< $375 per contract right so you you $375 per contract right so you you notice< notice that it's still a little bit shy notice that it's still a little bit shy from< from your $500 Max risk that means you from your $500 Max risk that means you still< still have about still have about $125< $125 uh risk that you can put on but at $125 uh risk that you can put on but at the< the same time you cannot go two the same time you cannot go two contracts< contracts right if you go two contracts contracts right if you go two contracts it< it will way exceed 500 because now it it will way exceed 500 because now it will< will become around $700 $50 so what do will. become around $700 $50 so what do you< you do in this case so in this case what you do in this case so in this case what you< you want to do is just simply widen out you want to do is just simply widen out your< your width right so now instead of 5o your width right so now instead of 5o white< white you stretch that long option to white you stretch that long option to additional< additional $1 white so from here as you additional $1 white so from here as you can< can see if you put on a $6 wide spread can see if you put on a $6 wide spread take< take a look at your premium first you take a look at your premium first you receive< receive $1. 50 and your max race now is receive $1.

50 and your max race now is $450< $450 which is $450 which is $450< $450 per contract which is pretty close $450 per contract which is pretty close to< to the max risk that you have already to the max risk that you have already decided< decided that you want for this trade decided that you want for this trade right< right so once you're comfortable with right so once you're comfortable with this< this all you have to do is put on the this all you have to do is put on the trade< trade okay so this is how you actually trade okay so this is how you actually Define< Define your wings now that you already Define your wings now. that you already constructed< constructed your credit spread the next constructed your credit spread the next step< step is to adjust your credit right so step is to adjust your credit right so they< they will give you credit at the start they will give you credit at the start so< so generally what I like to do is I like so generally what I like to do is I like to< to adjust my credit spread slightly to adjust my credit spread slightly higher< higher than the mid price so as you can higher than the mid price so as you can see< see down here they're saying that I can see down here they're saying that I can get get get $1. 97< $1.

97 so generally what I like to do is $1. 97 so generally what I like to do is just< just push it a little bit more to the just push it a little bit more to the right< right hand side that means try and get a right. hand side that means try and get a slightly< slightly higher credit and in this case slightly higher credit and in this case maybe< maybe I might go for something like maybe I might go for something like $1.

99< $1. 99 now what you want to understand $1.

99 now what you want to understand here< here is that there's a natural price here is that there's a natural price down< down here net net just means the natural down here net net just means the natural price< price that you will surely get filled price that you will surely get filled now< now this is the price where you do not now this is the price where you do not want< want to choose at the start because this want to choose at the start because this is< is the worst feeli that you can get is the worst feeli that you can get right< right instead go for something around right instead go for something around the< the mid price first and then you have the mid price first and then you have two< two options. right the first thing is two options right the first thing is that< that you could just wait to get Fu right that you could just wait to get Fu right you< you can just wait until the market you you can just wait until the market you know< know starts trading at this price for know starts trading at this price for your< your credit spr and then you get fued or your credit spr and then you get fued or if< if you want to get fued immediately then if you want to get fued immediately then this< this is where you want to adjust until this is where you want to adjust until you< you get Fu right so let's say for you get Fu right so let's say for example< example you start off with $1. 99 what example you start off with $1.

99 what I'll< I'll do is I will send the trade in and I'll do is I will send the trade in and then< then if within a few seconds I do not then if within a few seconds I do not get< get fill what I'll do is that I'll get fill what I'll do is that I'll adjust< adjust my credit down right I'll adjust adjust my credit down right I'll adjust it< it bit by bit. right so maybe in this it bit by bit right so maybe in this case< case I'm adjust to 198 then if I don't case I'm adjust to 198 then if I don't get< get fill I adjust to 197 if I don't get get fill I adjust to 197 if I don't get fill< fill I adjust to 196 if I don't get fill fill I adjust to 196 if I don't get fill I< I just do $1. 95 so on and so forth until I just do $1.

#### Topic 2

95 so on and so forth until I< I can finally get fill all right so I can finally get fill all right so these< these are the five steps for you to these are the five steps for you to enter< enter into a credit spread now that we enter into a credit spread now that we have< have entered into a credit spread the have entered into a credit spread the next< next question you might be asking is next question you might be asking is Davis< Davis how do you exit the credit spread Davis how do you exit the credit spread right< right now all right so I'm going to give right now all right so I'm going to give you< you five methods right five ways for you you five methods right five ways for you to< to exit a credit spread now the very to exit a credit spread now the very first< first method is to hold to expiration so first method is to hold to expiration so as< as you can see here this is a table that as you can see here this is a table that I< I showed you earlier on whereby you know I showed you earlier on whereby you know they< they did the test on the spy and they they did the test on the spy and they put< put on the 20 Delta put spread and as put on the 20 Delta put spread and as you< you can see here if you hold all the way you can see here if you hold all the way to< to expiration it's still a profit right to expiration it's still a profit right you< you take a look at the daily p&amp;l this is you take a look at the daily p&amp;l this is daily< daily average pnl you can see that daily average pnl you can see that overall< overall it's still in a profit which is overall it's still in a profit which is not< not bad right but a slightly better way not bad right but a slightly better way for< for you to exit a credit spread might be for you to exit a credit spread might be method< method number two and then is to take method number two and then is to take profit< profit at 50% or hold to expiration profit at 50% or hold to expiration whichever< whichever comes first right so for whichever comes first right so for example< example if you sold the credit spread example if you sold the credit spread let's< let's say you sold it at $2 right so let's say you sold it at $2 right so basically< basically what you want to do is that basically what you want to do is that you< you want to exit the trade once it is you want to exit the trade once it is marking< marking for a dollar all right if it's marking for a dollar all right if it's marking< marking for a dollar this is where you marking for a dollar this is where you take< take profit exit the trade right but if take profit exit the trade right but if it< it doesn't reach a dollar let's say for it doesn't reach a dollar let's say for example< example the moment you put it on it example the moment you put it on it never< never reaches a dollar and then let's never reaches a dollar and then let's say< say for example it keeps going up this say for example it keeps going up this is< is where you can hold all the way to is where you can hold all the way to expiration< expiration so in this case you can see expiration so in this case you can see that< that the uh daily pnl is actually higher that the uh daily pnl is actually higher right< right which means to say that if you right which means to say that if you were< were to take profit at 50% or hold to were to take profit at 50% or hold to expiration< expiration whichever comes first then expiration whichever comes first then you're< you're definitely going to have a better you're definitely going to have a better results< results than holding to expiration now results than holding to expiration now method< method number three is to exit at 21 DTE method number three is to exit at 21 DTE now< now this is a study done also by the now this is a study done also by the tasty< tasty trade research team where they tasty trade research team where they came< came out with a 21 DTE exit point and came out with a 21 DTE exit point and what< what they found out is that when you what they found out is that when you exit< exit at 21 DTE you actually have pretty exit at 21 DTE you actually have pretty good< good results right as you can see down good results right as you can see down here< here at 21 DTE both your annual Roc is here at 21 DTE both your annual Roc is higher< higher than if you were to hold to higher than if you were to hold to expiration< expiration right but the thing is that expiration right but the thing is that you< you will have a slightly lower win rate you will have a slightly lower win rate right< right if you hold to exploration you right if you hold to exploration you have< have a higher win rate right you have have a higher win rate right you have 90%< 90% win rate but if you were to exit 90% win rate but if you were to exit earlier< earlier your wi rate is around 80% but earlier your wi rate is around 80% but that< that doesn't mean that your results are that doesn't mean that your results are worse< worse in fact your results are actually worse in fact your results are actually better< better and the reason is because you better and the reason is because you notice< notice that you control your losses notice that you control your losses actually< actually much better than if you would actually much better than if you would hold< hold to expiration because if you hold hold to expiration because if you hold to< to expiration then your losses get to expiration then your losses get pretty< pretty big but if you were to exit at 21 pretty big but if you were to exit at 21 DTE< DTE what they found out is that you can DTE what they found out is that you can really< really control your loss pretty well so really control your loss pretty well so that< that is why your average loss turns out that is why your average loss turns out to< to be so much lesser than the average to be so much lesser than the average loss< loss if you hold to exploration which loss if you hold to exploration which makes< makes the whole trade overall much more makes the whole trade overall much more profitable< profitable in the long term although you profitable in the long term although you have< have a lower win rate now method number have a lower win rate now method number four< four is a combination of taking profit four is a combination of taking profit at< at 50% or exiting at 21 DTE so it's at 50% or exiting at 21 DTE so it's similar< similar to Method number two right you similar to Method number two right you notice< notice method number two is take profit notice method number two is take profit at< at 50% or hold to expiration so hold to at 50% or hold to expiration so hold to expiration< expiration is the threshold right is the expiration is the threshold right is the the< the longest holding Point whereas for the longest holding Point whereas for method< method four the longest holding point method four the longest holding point will< will be up to the 21 DTE marks that will be up to the 21 DTE marks that means< means to say if by the time your trade means to say if by the time your trade reaches< reaches the 21 DTE Mark that means there reaches the 21 DTE Mark that means there 21< 21 days left to expiration and you're 21 days left to expiration and you're not< not at the 50% profit point then you not at the 50% profit point then you close< close the trade right even though it's a close the trade right even though it's a loss< loss so as you can see in this study loss so as you can see in this study down< down here now you notice that it say 16 down here now you notice that it say 16 Delta< Delta puts right so I haven't seen a Delta puts right so I haven't seen a study< study for the put spread or maybe I study for the put spread or maybe I haven't< haven't found it yet because I haven't haven't found it yet because I haven't gone< gone through all of the videos just yet gone through all of the videos just yet but< but basically. it's going to be pretty but basically it's going to be pretty similar< similar right short put and uh put similar right short put and uh put spread< spread is similar strategy where it's bu spread is similar strategy where it's bu although< although the results May just slightly although the results May just slightly differ< differ but the results shouldn't be that differ but the results shouldn't be that far< far in terms of the difference between far in terms of the difference between the< the you know managing at 21 DTE which is the you know managing at 21 DTE which is earlier< earlier managing at 50% of expiration or earlier managing at 50% of expiration or the< the combo right so the combo is the combo right so the combo is basically< basically the method number four so you basically the method number four so you notice< notice that all three are still higher notice that all three are still higher than< than holding to expiration so if you than holding to expiration so if you were< were to choose a method for exiting the were to choose a method for exiting the trade< trade you definitely want to choose trade you definitely want to choose either< either method two three or four all either method two three or four all right< right now the last method can actually right now the last method can actually give< give you a better win rate or a much give you a better win rate or a much much< much now method number five is much now method number five is discretionary< discretionary exit now this is based on discretionary exit now this is based on maybe< maybe you have technical analysis or maybe you have technical analysis or maybe< maybe you like to see news or you have maybe you like to see news or you have some< some indicators that maybe tells you to some indicators that maybe tells you to get< get out of the trade right so this is get out of the trade right so this is what< what I call discretionary exit now as what I call discretionary exit now as for< for the result of this it's very very for the result of this it's very very hard< hard to tell because it's discretionary hard to tell because it's discretionary and< and if it's discretionary it's 100% and if it's discretionary it's 100% reliant< reliant on you as the trader for the reliant on you as the trader for the final< final result right so discretionary exit final result right so discretionary exit can< can actually use better results than you can actually use better results than you know< know method one to four if you are very know method one to four if you are very Ono< Ono right you're very in tune to the Ono right you're very in tune to the market< market right I know of such a Trader market right I know of such a Trader when< when you know back then when I was in a when you know back then when I was in a proprietary< proprietary trading firm I know of a proprietary trading firm I know of a Trader< Trader that is very discretionary in his Trader that is very discretionary in his exits< exits right he can exit a trade when he exits right he can exit a trade when he feels< feels something is not right but he feels something is not right but he can't< can't tell you what is not right right can't tell you what is not right right he< he can't put it into words but he know he can't put it into words but he know that< that you know the market may go against that you know the market may go against his< his trade now so it's time for him to his trade now so it's time for him to exit< exit so he's actually doing pretty well exit so he's actually doing pretty well as< as one of the most profitable Traders as one of the most profitable Traders then< then but to actually be very good at then but to actually be very good at discretionary< discretionary exit it's very very discretionary exit it's very very difficult< difficult right you need to have very difficult right you need to have very you< you know many years of experience in the you know many years of experience in the market< market trading then you have this kind market trading then you have this kind of< of feel but if you're just stting out of feel but if you're just stting out it's< it's best to stick to you know one of it's best to stick to you know one of the< the above methods especially two three the above methods especially two three or< or four this way you know it's much or four this way you know it's much easier< easier for you to know the results right easier for you to know the results right especially< especially since Studies have already especially since Studies have already been< been done on it right we already know been done on it right we already know that< that the studies have been proven that that the studies have been proven that in< in the long term you stick to this in the long term you stick to this mechanics< mechanics you're going to be net mechanics you're going to be net profitable< profitable in the long term but whereas profitable in the long term but whereas for< for method 5 you're never going to know for method 5 you're never going to know because< because in the end it's all 100% up to because in the end it's all 100% up to you< you all right so these are the five you all right so these are the five methods< methods to exit a credit spread now the methods to exit a credit spread now the next< next topic we're going to touch on is next topic we're going to touch on is how< how to manage losing credit spreads and how to manage losing credit spreads and that< that is one of the most uh asked topic that is one of the most uh asked topic that< that I have on my channel as well is you that I have on my channel as well is you know< know what do you do if your credit know what do you do if your credit spread< spread is currently you know in a draw spread is currently you know in a draw down< down right you see is it losing money down right you see is it losing money right< right now should you hold it should you right now should you hold it should you roll< roll it should you close it you know roll it should you close it you know what< what should you do all right so I'm what should you do all right so I'm going< going to give you with a number of going to give you with a number of scenarios< scenarios and then let's just work it scenarios and then let's just work it out< out together all right to see which is out together all right to see which is the< the best option right so this is the the best option right so this is the trade< trade right so just imagine that you're trade right so just imagine that you're putting< putting on a buut spread right so this putting on a buut spread right so this is< is a $5 wide buut spread you have it uh is a $5 wide buut spread you have it uh down< down here as you can see it's the 175 down here as you can see it's the 175 170< 170 and there's 50 DTE on this trade and 170 and there's 50 DTE on this trade and the< the premium which you receive is A1 30 the premium which you receive is A1 30 cents< cents right so there will be a number of cents right so there will be a number of scenarios< scenarios that you will face as you are scenarios that you will face as you are trading< trading this buut spread so the very trading this buut spread so the very first< first scenario that you will experience first scenario that you will experience is< is that the market went down but it did is that the market went down but it did not< not test your short strike right but not test your short strike right but although< although it did not test your short although it did not test your short strike< strike your buo spread is now Worth strike your buo spread is now Worth a160< a160 right and now there's 40 DTE left a160 right and now there's 40 DTE left which< which means to say you're actually down which means to say you're actually down about< about $30 right so if you do the math about $30 right so if you do the math you'll< you'll be able to see this right so you you'll be able to see this right so you sold< sold it at A1 30 Cent is right now sold it at A1 30 Cent is right now marking< marking at $1. 60 that means you're at a marking at $1.

60 that means you're at a loss< loss of about 30 cents which is $30 so loss of about 30 cents which is $30 so at< at this point of time what do you do at this point of time what do you do right< right there's still 40 days to right there's still 40 days to expiration< expiration left so should you be holding expiration left so should you be holding Rolling< Rolling or closing at this point now for Rolling or closing at this point now for me< me personally I would just still hold on me personally I would just still hold on to< to trade because it's still not at 21 to trade because it's still not at 21 DTE< DTE and at this point it's still too DTE and at this point it's still too early< early right I still want to let Theta early right I still want to let Theta Decay< Decay work remember when you're trading Decay work remember when you're trading credit< credit spreads any short option credit spreads any short option strategies< strategies we are making use of theta strategies we are making use of theta right< right so although the market has went right so although the market has went down< down you're in a loss you do not have to down you're in a loss you do not have to panic< panic right it's not even near. your panic right it's not even near your short< short put strike right now you just have short put strike right now you just have to< to let Theta work so even though if you to let Theta work so even though if you hold< hold all the way to expiration and it hold all the way to expiration and it expires< expires you know just slightly above expires you know just slightly above your< your sh foot maybe let's say it expires your sh foot maybe let's say it expires around< around 176 which is above your shut around 176 which is above your shut strike< strike of 175 you're still going to be strike of 175 you're still going to be profitable< profitable right so there's no need to profitable right so there's no need to panic< panic as of this point all you have to panic as of this point all you have to do< do right now is simply just hold it now do right now is simply just hold it now scenario< scenario number two now what if the scenario number two now what if the market< market has actually gone down and now market has actually gone down and now has< has already tested your sh put strike has already tested your sh put strike right< right and your buut spread is now worth right and your buut spread is now worth a1. < a1.

90 and you have 40 DTE left so at a1. 90 and you have 40 DTE left so at this< this point in time your loss is how much this point in time your loss is how much is< is $60 right because your loss is about is $60 right because your loss is about 60< 60 cents right now so at this point do 60 cents right now so at this point do you< you hold do you roll or do you close so you hold do you roll or do you close so for< for me the answer would be to just hold for me the answer would be to just hold the< the trade again it's still not at 21 DTE the trade again it's still not at 21 DTE so< so remember the table that I showed you so remember the table that I showed you earlier< earlier on if you were to just exit at earlier on if you were to just exit at 21< 21 DTE without even managing your 21 DTE without even managing your profits< profits at all you're still going to get profits at all you're still going to get pretty< pretty good result so this is my pretty good result so this is my threshold< threshold the latest point at where I threshold the latest point at where I plan< plan to exit right my trade so in this plan to exit right my trade so in this case< case then there's nothing for me to do case then there's nothing for me to do right< right I just going to hold it until it right I just going to hold it until it reaches< reaches 21 DTE then I'll decide right at reaches 21 DTE then I'll decide right at the< the meanwhile I'm just going to continue the meanwhile I'm just going to continue to< to let Theta Decay do its work now to let Theta Decay do its work now scenario< scenario number three so this time the scenario number three so this time the market< market actually went down same thing it market actually went down same thing it tested< tested your short strike your blush spr tested your short strike your blush spr right< right now is $180 so that means you are right now is $180 so that means you are now< now down now down $50< $50 but this time there's 21 DTF right $50 but this time there's 21 DTF right so< so what do you do right so in this so what do you do right so in this scenario< scenario there are actually two viable scenario there are actually two viable options< options right the first thing is that options right the first thing is that you< you could actually roll there's actually you could actually roll there's actually 21< 21 DTE left so if you were to roll it 21 DTE left so if you were to roll it it's< it's possible that you could get it it's possible that you could get it somewhere< somewhere around the 45 DTE Mark which somewhere around the 45 DTE Mark which is< is again our optimal DTE that we want to is again our optimal DTE that we want to go< go for where we have an edge so go for where we have an edge so definitely< definitely rolling is possible but you definitely rolling is possible but you need< need to understand is that when you're need to understand is that when you're rolling< rolling the trade right now what you're rolling the trade right now what you're doing< doing is that you're closing out your doing is that you're closing out your existing< existing trade for a loss and then existing trade for a loss and then selling< selling another trade at this time selling another trade at this time around< around a 50% win rate right because around a 50% win rate right because right< right now the market is currently at right now the market is currently at where< where your short put strike is so if where your short put strike is so if you're< you're around a short put strike is your you're around a short put strike is your win< win rate is roughly around 50 to maybe win rate is roughly around 50 to maybe 55%< 55% somewhere around there but when you 55% somewhere around there but when you first< first put on the trade most likely it first put on the trade most likely it should< should be higher right maybe it's around should be higher right maybe it's around 7< 7 % win rate if you chose something like 7 % win rate if you chose something like a< a 30 Delta put spread so right now you a 30 Delta put spread so right now you have< have to settle for a lower win rate have to settle for a lower win rate trade< trade right so whether you want to roll trade right so whether you want to roll or< or not this really comes down to you I or not this really comes down to you I generally< generally don't want to roll instead I generally don't want to roll instead I would< would just close out the trade because I would just close out the trade because I want< want to be mechanical right because if I want to be mechanical right because if I were< were to close out the trade right now I were to close out the trade right now I know< know that statistics have already shown know that statistics have already shown that< that I have an edge so that is why for that I have an edge so that is why for me< me personally if it comes to 21 DTE I'll me personally if it comes to 21 DTE I'll just< just mechanically just close out the just mechanically just close out the trade< trade now what about are holding the trade now what about are holding the trade< trade right so some people could say trade right so some people could say that< that hey uh I want to hold the trade that hey uh I want to hold the trade because< because I think that the market might because I think that the market might bounce< bounce back up so you definitely can bounce back up so you definitely can still< still hold on to trade especially if you still hold on to trade especially if you have< have a gut feel that you know the market have a gut feel that you know the market is< is going to go up but what you need to is going to go up but what you need to understand< understand is the risk involved in understand is the risk involved in holding< holding on to this trade at this point holding on to this trade at this point in< in time right because the market may in time right because the market may bounce< bounce up and then you could profit yes bounce up and then you could profit yes but< but there's also the possibility that but there's also the possibility that the< the market can continue going down and the market can continue going down and if< if it continues to go down that will if it continues to go down that will further< further deepen your losses when you further deepen your losses when you could< could have gotten out earlier to cut could have gotten out earlier to cut your< your losses short and at this point in your losses short and at this point in time< time because it's also past 21 DTE and time because it's also past 21 DTE and as< as the market goes down now you have an as the market goes down now you have an increased< increased risk of getting assigned on increased risk of getting assigned on your< your shut right so if you get assigned your shut right so if you get assigned on< on your short putut it means that you on your short putut it means that you will< will now be long 100 shares and that may will now be long 100 shares and that may get< get you into Margin Call if you don't get you into Margin Call if you don't have< have the enough you know the funds to have the enough you know the funds to actually< actually purchase 100 shares of the actually purchase 100 shares of the underlying< underlying so this is also pretty underlying so this is also pretty important< important for you to understand when important for you to understand when you're< you're thinking of holding on the trade you're thinking of holding on the trade past< past the 21 DTE mark past the 21 DTE mark now< now scenario number four so scenario now scenario number four so scenario number< number four is now the market went down number four is now the market went down to< to test your long put strike at $170 or to test your long put strike at $170 or lower< lower and your boo Sprint is now worth lower and your boo Sprint is now worth $3< $3 with 30 DTE left so right now you're $3 with 30 DTE left so right now you're in< in a pretty big loss right so if it's in a pretty big loss right so if it's marking< marking right now for $3 it just means marking right now for $3 it just means right< right now you are down right now you are down $170< $170 right so $170 you're down and $170 right so $170 you're down and there's< there's 30 DTE left so at this point of there's 30 DTE left so at this point of time< time what exactly do you do so for me time what exactly do you do so for me the< the answer is actually to just hold it the answer is actually to just hold it right< right and the main reason for this is right and the main reason for this is because< because there is still 30 DTE left and because there is still 30 DTE left and it< it has not reached my threshold of 31 it has not reached my threshold of 31 DTE< DTE so remember if let's say for example DTE so remember if let's say for example you're< you're going for method four which I you're going for method four which I mentioned< mentioned is 50% take profit or 21 DTE mentioned is 50% take profit or 21 DTE so< so at this point you notice that none of so at this point you notice that none of these< these two conditions have been met yet these two conditions have been met yet right< right so if none of these conditions right so if none of these conditions. have< have been met all I do is just hold on have been met all I do is just hold on to< to it because the market could just to it because the market could just bounce< bounce back up in the next few days and bounce back up in the next few days and if< if it does bounce up in the next few if it does bounce up in the next few days< days then there's a possibility that it days then there's a possibility that it could< could also reach the 50% TI profit if it could also reach the 50% TI profit if it bounce< bounce up high enough but if it bounce up high enough but if it continues< continues to go down then I also do not continues to go down then I also do not really< really have to worry also because I really have to worry also because I already< already know that my Max loss has been already know that my Max loss has been kept< kept and at the same time I'm going to kept and at the same time I'm going to lean< lean on the statistic that 21 DTE is lean on the statistic that 21 DTE is going< going to be superior uh performance in going to be superior uh performance in the< the long term than compared to holding the long term than compared to holding to< to exploration right so the worst case to exploration right so the worst case scenario< scenario for me is at 21 DTE so as long scenario for me is at 21 DTE so as long as< as it has not reached either of these as it has not reached either of these two< two I'm just staying into the trade all two I'm just staying into the trade all right< right so we've come to the last scenario right so we've come to the last scenario and< and last scenario scenario number five and last scenario scenario number five is< is now the market went down to test your is now the market went down to test your lput< lput strike at 170 or lower which is lput strike at 170 or lower which is similar< similar to scenario number four but now similar to scenario number four but now your< your buut spread is having a bigger loss your buut spread is having a bigger loss because< because right now there's 21 DTE left because right now there's 21 DTE left right< right so days have passed the market did right so days have passed the market did not< not bounce back up is still below your not bounce back up is still below your long< long put strike so what do you do at long put strike so what do you do at this< this point in time do you hold do you this point in time do you hold do you roll< roll or do you close so for me at this roll or do you close so for me at this point< point of time I'm just going to be point of time I'm just going to be mechanical< mechanical and I'm just going to close mechanical and I'm just going to close out< out the trade right because I know again out the trade right because I know again the< the long-term statistics have really the long-term statistics have really shown< shown that we're going to get a better shown that we're going to get a better performance< performance if we just close it out at performance if we just close it out at around< around 21 DTE and you also get to manage around 21 DTE and you also get to manage your< your loss right you can see down here your loss right you can see down here again< again your average loss is going to be again your average loss is going to be much< much less than if you're going to hold much less than if you're going to hold it< it to expiration because the biggest it to expiration because the biggest risk< risk right now is what if the market risk right now is what if the market continues< continues to you know go further and all continues to you know go further and all of< of a sudden you could lose the max loss of a sudden you could lose the max loss on< on this trade right if you lose the max on this trade right if you lose the max loss< loss on this trade it just means it's loss on this trade it just means it's going< going to take a little bit more wins uh going to take a little bit more wins uh the< the next few times for you to recover the next few times for you to recover this< this loss so right now I might actually this loss so right now I might actually just< just you know take the loss down here just you know take the loss down here now< now with that said there's actually the now with that said there's actually the argument< argument that you can actually still argument that you can actually still hold< hold on to this trade right now even hold on to this trade right now even though< though it's at 21 DT in the market though it's at 21 DT in the market Market< Market has gone you know way past your Market has gone you know way past your long< long put strike and the argument is that long put strike and the argument is that if< if it's already deep in the money then if it's already deep in the money then there's< there's not much left to lose right there's not much left to lose right let's< let's say for example there's only $50 let's say for example there's only $50 left< left or less to lose on the trade right left or less to lose on the trade right that< that means no matter how long that you that means no matter how long that you hold< hold on to this trade even though you hold on to this trade even though you hold< hold it to expiration the most that you hold it to expiration the most that you can< can additionally lose is only $50 so can additionally lose is only $50 so some< some people might say that hey I already some people might say that hey I already held< held it until so long there's only $50 held it until so long there's only $50 left< left and then there's so much more to left and then there's so much more to gain< gain from that point because if the gain from that point because if the market< market really reverses and goes back up market really reverses and goes back up then< then now suddenly my risk reward is so then now suddenly my risk reward is so good< good so at this point of time can you good so at this point of time can you actually< actually hold it then the answer is actually hold it then the answer is actually< actually yes you can choose to hold it actually yes you can choose to hold it especially< especially you know there's not much especially you know there's not much loss< loss left you can you know have if you loss left you can you know have if you continue< continue holding on to this trade but continue holding on to this trade but one< one thing you need to really remember is one thing you need to really remember is that< that because it's also now deep in the that because it's also now deep in the money< money that means your short put strike money that means your short put strike is< is also deep in the money there's also is also deep in the money there's also an< an increased chance that you might get an increased chance that you might get exercise< exercise on this short putut so this is exercise on this short putut so this is one< one thing to really understand so if you one thing to really understand so if you get< get actually a sign on this short putut get actually a sign on this short putut then< then this is where you need to know how then this is where you need to know how to< to reverse it right reverse this trade to reverse it right reverse this trade and< and for this I actually already created and for this I actually already created a< a video on this I

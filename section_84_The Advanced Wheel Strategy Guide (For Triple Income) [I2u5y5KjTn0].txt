Language: en alright< alright alrighty so today we're going to alright alrighty so today we're going to be< be talking about the triple income be talking about the triple income option< option strategy which is the wheel option strategy which is the wheel strategy< strategy now i already created a video strategy now i already created a video previously< previously on the real strategy but previously on the real strategy but today< today for this video we're going to go a today for this video we're going to go a little< little bit more in depth and i'm also little bit more in depth and i'm also going< going to be sharing with you an advanced going to be sharing with you an advanced concept< concept that can also help you increase concept that can also help you increase your< your profits from the wheel strategy so your profits from the wheel strategy so let's< let's do a quick recap on what the wheel let's do a quick recap on what the wheel strategy< strategy is right so the real strategy strategy is right so the real strategy basically< basically starts off by selling a cash basically starts off by selling a cash secure< secure put with the objective that we secure put with the objective that we want< want to get assigned on this 100 shares want to get assigned on this 100 shares right< right so once we get a sign on the 100 right so once we get a sign on the 100 shares< shares we're going to sell our cover shares we're going to sell our cover call call call and< and then on the cover call we want to and then on the cover call we want to have< have our shares called away and then we have our shares called away and then we will< will go back to selling the cash account will go back to selling the cash account put< put again and we'll do this over and put again and we'll do this over and over< over again so basically this is the real over again so basically this is the real strategy< strategy now in the previous video i strategy now in the previous video i talked< talked about only these two income talked about only these two income sources< sources basically just to sources basically just to get< get a premium from selling cash to cut get a premium from selling cash to cut put< put as well as a couple call put as well as a couple call so< so for example this is the stock right so for example this is the stock right now< now and then we'll be selling an out of now and then we'll be selling an out of the< the money cashier output the money cashier output all< all right cash output and then the all right cash output and then the market market market uh< uh hopefully was to go below the cash uh hopefully was to go below the cash output< output and then we'll be assigned on output and then we'll be assigned on this< this cashing output so we'll be now long this cashing output so we'll be now long 100< 100 shares and then we'll be selling a 100 shares and then we'll be selling a covered< covered call at the very same strike covered call at the very same strike price< price so that when the stock goes up price so that when the stock goes up and< and then we will get will be assigned on and then we will get will be assigned on the< the covered call that means our 100 the covered call that means our 100 shares< shares will be called away and this way shares will be called away and this way we'll< we'll be back to square one again where we'll be back to square one again where we< we sell a cash output again so in this we sell a cash output again so in this case< case we do not make anything on the case we do not make anything on the shares< shares because we are essentially buying shares because we are essentially buying and< and selling at the same price the only and selling at the same price the only income< income which we receive is from selling income which we receive is from selling the< the cashing output and a cup call but the cashing output and a cup call but for< for this video we're going to be talking for this video we're going to be talking about< about the third income source which is a about the third income source which is a candle< candle gains from stock and usually candle gains from stock and usually the< the gains which you get from the capital the gains which you get from the capital gains< gains of the stock would be higher than gains of the stock would be higher than the< the premiums which you receive from the premiums which you receive from selling< selling the cashing output and the selling the cashing output and the covered< covered calls so basically it will be covered calls so basically it will be something< something like this something like this so< so this time so this time right< right we'll be selling a cash output right we'll be selling a cash output still< still out of the money as well still out of the money as well but< but this time as the stock goes down but this time as the stock goes down now< now we get exercised now we are along now we get exercised now we are along 100< 100 shares so this time instead of 100 shares so this time instead of selling< selling the cover call at the same selling the cover call at the same strike< strike price we're going to sell our strike price we're going to sell our cover< cover call above our entry price cover call above our entry price for< for where we are along the 100 shares so for where we are along the 100 shares so this< this way when the stock goes up this way when the stock goes up all< all right we will be assigned on the all right we will be assigned on the cover< cover call so 100 shares will be called cover call so 100 shares will be called away< away so we'll be making money on the away so we'll be making money on the cashing< cashing output making money on the cover cashing output making money on the cover call< call and we'll be also making a capital call and we'll be also making a capital gains gains gains right< right from right from our< our underlying stock as well so when our underlying stock as well so when you're< you're selling the cash to your output you're selling the cash to your output we< we are basically earning extrinsic value we are basically earning extrinsic value right< right because we're selling all of the right because we're selling all of the money< money uh put options and for the cover money uh put options and for the cover call< call we'll be selling out of the money call we'll be selling out of the money call< call options so this two will be call options so this two will be extrinsic< extrinsic value but the capital gains extrinsic value but the capital gains from< from the stock this would be intrinsic from the stock this would be intrinsic value< value because a stock position 100 value because a stock position 100 shares< shares is always 100 intrinsic value so shares is always 100 intrinsic value so in< in this triple income option strategy in this triple income option strategy we'll< we'll be having a very good mix a very we'll be having a very good mix a very good< good profit mix of extrinsic value and good profit mix of extrinsic value and intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value extraction extraction extraction so< so what makes the so what makes the wheel< wheel strategy profitable is only if you wheel strategy profitable is only if you choose< choose the right stock so this has been choose the right stock so this has been quite< quite a pretty hot topic for a lot of quite a pretty hot topic for a lot of people< people especially they have been asking people especially they have been asking uh< uh me quite a number of times how do you uh me quite a number of times how do you choose< choose the stock for the real strategy choose the stock for the real strategy so so so i< i want to spend some time on this i want to spend some time on this section< section so that you can understand my section so that you can understand my thought< thought process when it comes to thought process when it comes to selecting< selecting stocks so for me the first selecting stocks so for me the first thing< thing i always do when it comes to any thing i always do when it comes to any strategy< strategy in the options strategy in the options when< when i trade any options i always choose when i trade any options i always choose stocks< stocks that i don't mind owning for the stocks that i don't mind owning for the long< long term long term and< and that means that these are stocks and that means that these are stocks that< that i believe will go up in the long that i believe will go up in the long term< term as opposed to just going for stocks term as opposed to just going for stocks that< that gives you high premium right so that gives you high premium right so there< there are a lot of option traders out there are a lot of option traders out there< there they are mainly trading those high there they are mainly trading those high volatility< volatility stocks right these are stocks volatility stocks right these are stocks like< like your game stops amc a lot of those like your game stops amc a lot of those meme< meme stocks right so meme stocks right so if< if you were to go with those kinds of if you were to go with those kinds of stocks< stocks yes you can get high premiums but stocks yes you can get high premiums but the< the problem is that you may not the problem is that you may not necessarily< necessarily be able to necessarily be able to uh uh uh get< get the real strategy to be profitable get the real strategy to be profitable in< in the long term because right a lot of in the long term because right a lot of this< this means stocks they aren't actually this means stocks they aren't actually profitable< profitable all right so they they do not profitable all right so they they do not have< have increasing revenue do not have have increasing revenue do not have increasing< increasing profits so the problem with increasing profits so the problem with such< such stocks is that let's say for such stocks is that let's say for example< example you sell the cash account put example you sell the cash account put down< down here right so as we all know uh we down here right so as we all know uh we want< want the stock to go down want the stock to go down and< and then we sell our cash secure output and then we sell our cash secure output right< right so our cash report is gone we want right so our cash report is gone we want to< to sell our call here but the problem is to sell our call here but the problem is that< that what if the stock doesn't recover that what if the stock doesn't recover right< right it goes all the way down so now right it goes all the way down so now you< you are stuck with 100 shares and your you are stuck with 100 shares and your cover< cover call expires worthless and then cover call expires worthless and then now< now you cannot get out of this position now you cannot get out of this position all right< all right so while you may have a lot of all right so while you may have a lot of a< a premium from selling your cash output a premium from selling your cash output and< and your cover call yeah you still and your cover call yeah you still wouldn't< wouldn't make money at the end of day wouldn't make money at the end of day you< you can close up a position you can close up a position if< if you cannot get out of this 100 shares if you cannot get out of this 100 shares right< right so right so of< of these meme stocks tend to have a of these meme stocks tend to have a little< little bit of that risk baked in because little bit of that risk baked in because of< of the fact that they aren't actually of the fact that they aren't actually profitable< profitable so i would rather go for profitable so i would rather go for stocks stocks stocks that< that do not have as much volatility that that do not have as much volatility that means< means do not give as much uh premiums means do not give as much uh premiums but< but in the long term the stock will but in the long term the stock will always< always go up so always go up so now< now there are few ways to identify now there are few ways to identify stocks< stocks that will always go up right stocks that will always go up right so< so of course it's not a guarantee but so of course it's not a guarantee but it's< it's always a uh when you talk about it's always a uh when you talk about investment< investment and trading it's always in investment and trading it's always in terms< terms of probability so the first thing terms of probability so the first thing that that that that< that i look for in the stock is for good that i look for in the stock is for good fundamentals< fundamentals right good fundamental fundamentals right good fundamental means< means right you have increasing revenue means right you have increasing revenue increasing< increasing net income and high free cash increasing net income and high free cash flow< flow so you see a stock flow so you see a stock the< the most important thing is when you the most important thing is when you choose< choose a stock he has to always go choose a stock he has to always go higher< higher and that it doesn't go to zero higher and that it doesn't go to zero right< right i mean this sounds a little bit right i mean this sounds a little bit you< you know you know straightforward< straightforward but the thing is that a straightforward but the thing is that a lot< lot of people choose these stocks with lot of people choose these stocks with no< no profitability so if a stock is not no profitability so if a stock is not profitable profitable profitable they< they have mountains of debt there's they have mountains of debt there's always< always a chance that you can go bankrupt always a chance that you can go bankrupt if< if it goes bankrupt then there's no way if it goes bankrupt then there's no way for< for the the stock will definitely go to for the the stock will definitely go to zero< zero right so that is why i always look zero right so that is why i always look to< to make sure that the company is to make sure that the company is profitable profitable profitable so< so only take a look at these three uh so only take a look at these three uh income< income statements of three different income statements of three different companies< companies right you have company a here companies right you have company a here company< company b company b and< and company c and company c right< right if you would just take a look at right if you would just take a look at this< this three income statements you don't this three income statements you don't even< even bother about what's their name how even bother about what's their name how the< the stock chart looks like the stock chart looks like which< which is the company which you would which is the company which you would rather< rather you know trade in you would rather you know trade in you would invest< invest in you would do the real strategy invest in you would do the real strategy in in in right< right so the blue color bar shows the right so the blue color bar shows the revenue< revenue and the yellow color bar is the revenue and the yellow color bar is the net< net income that means the profits right net income that means the profits right so< so you can see in company a yes so you can see in company a yes increasing< increasing revenue increasing revenue and< and it also has increasing net income so and it also has increasing net income so this< this company has been profitable over this company has been profitable over the< the past five years the past five years now< now let's take a look at company b all now let's take a look at company b all right< right company b has increasing revenue right company b has increasing revenue okay< okay but as the revenue increases okay but as the revenue increases look< look at this look at this the< the loss also increases the loss also increases so< so would you want to invest in a company so would you want to invest in a company like< like this like this what< what about company c right company c what about company c right company c seems< seems to be all over the place right you seems to be all over the place right you have< have revenue that is very high for have revenue that is very high for the< the first of the three years. in the past the first of the three years in the past five< five years and then you have a huge dip five years and then you have a huge dip and< and then it goes back up and what about and then it goes back up and what about your< your profits right you have a loss here your profits right you have a loss here you< you have a slight positive here you have you have a slight positive here you have a< a loss here you have a a loss here you have a massive< massive loss here another last year massive loss here another last year would< would you want to put your hard-earned would you want to put your hard-earned money< money into this stocks money into this stocks chances< chances are that you wouldn't want to chances are that you wouldn't want to right< right because it's pretty risky right because it's pretty risky so< so what are these companies so what are these companies so< so if you take a look at the company so if you take a look at the company charts< charts you can see that their income charts you can see that their income statement< statement pretty reflects the stock statement pretty reflects the stock price< price itself so the first company is price itself so the first company is microsoft< microsoft microsoft has increasing microsoft microsoft has increasing revenue< revenue increasing profits and check out revenue increasing profits and check out the< the stock price it has been increasing the stock price it has been increasing non-stop< non-stop for the past five years in fact non-stop for the past five years in fact for< for the past decade or so even since the for the past decade or so even since the dot-com< dot-com crash microsoft has always made dot-com crash microsoft has always made new< new harsh now company b new harsh now company b increasing< increasing revenue but decreasing increasing revenue but decreasing profits< profits or rather increasing losses profits or rather increasing losses look< look at their stock price look at their stock price up< up and then down a rollercoaster ride up and then down a rollercoaster ride and< and the third stock is amc where you and the third stock is amc where you have< have a roller coaster of a revenue as have a roller coaster of a revenue as well< well as a net income so you can see you well as a net income so you can see you have< have this shoot up and then it goes back have this shoot up and then it goes back down< down again down again so< so if you notice that roadblocks and amc so if you notice that roadblocks and amc are< are still very heavily traded stocks a are still very heavily traded stocks a lot< lot of option traders like to trade them lot of option traders like to trade them because< because the premiums are high so if you because the premiums are high so if you were< were to do the real strategy on this too were to do the real strategy on this too no< no doubt that you're gonna get you know no doubt that you're gonna get you know high< high premiums but then what if you're high premiums but then what if you're caught< caught at certain places right what if caught at certain places right what if so< so happened that you managed you know so happened that you managed you know you< you entered the wheel strategy you saw you entered the wheel strategy you saw the< the cash account put here and now to the cash account put here and now to stop< stop this all the way down here stop this all the way down here right< right how are you going to recover right how are you going to recover or< or it's going to take a long time to or it's going to take a long time to recover< recover if it ever recovers and also for recover if it ever recovers and also for amc< amc what if you manage to you happen to amc what if you manage to you happen to get< get in your kessick output down here get in your kessick output down here right< right look at this you're going to right look at this you're going to take< take some time before it's going to take some time before it's going to recover< recover again so that is why when i come recover again so that is why when i come to< to when it comes to choosing stock i to when it comes to choosing stock i always< always go for generally i'll go for the always go for generally i'll go for the large< large caps ones and then also i'll go large caps ones and then also i'll go for< for companies that that are for companies that that are have< have a lot of profits a lot of revenue have a lot of profits a lot of revenue and< and high free cash flow and high free cash flow next< next you want to look for strong next you want to look for strong technical< technical so as you can see in the chart technical so as you can see in the chart earlier< earlier right what i like to go earlier right what i like to go for< for are companies that have gone through for are companies that have gone through several< several market crashes and still gone several market crashes and still gone higher< higher right so you can go as far back higher right so you can go as far back to< to maybe 2000 or even 1987 crash just to maybe 2000 or even 1987 crash just take< take a look at the chart right just go take a look at the chart right just go to< to the monthly chart and see have they to the monthly chart and see have they been been been growing< growing has the stock price been growing has the stock price been going< going higher each time going higher each time if< if it has then you know that this is if it has then you know that this is also< also a very potentially good stock for also a very potentially good stock for you< you to do the wheel strategy because you to do the wheel strategy because remember< remember the wheel strategy it has to remember the wheel strategy it has to always< always go up if the stock doesn't go up always go up if the stock doesn't go up then< then your wheel strategy is going to be then your wheel strategy is going to be hard< hard for you to make money all right hard for you to make money all right now< now lastly what if you're not that good now lastly what if you're not that good at< at finding stocks right you're not sure at finding stocks right you're not sure whether< whether the stock that you've chosen is whether the stock that you've chosen is is< is good well then you can go for the is good well then you can go for the broad-based< broad-based index etfs right because broad-based index etfs right because these< these are a much safer choice the index these are a much safer choice the index etfs< etfs they have a basket of stocks right etfs they have a basket of stocks right so< so if a certain stock is not performing so if a certain stock is not performing the< the etf would just rebalance them the etf would just rebalance them they'll< they'll remove it out and then replace they'll remove it out and then replace it< it with another stock so a good example it with another stock so a good example would< would be the board-based index of the would be the board-based index of the spiders< spiders qqqs spiders qqqs iwm< iwm as well as xlf right some of these iwm as well as xlf right some of these have< have names which some of the companies have names which some of the companies did< did go bankrupt before right one of did go bankrupt before right one of these< these uh stocks that have gone bankrupt these uh stocks that have gone bankrupt before< before is bastions before is bastions lehman< lehman brothers now this were included lehman brothers now this were included in< in some of the biggest in some of the biggest index< index funds but at the end of the day index funds but at the end of the day index< index funds still at the end still index funds still at the end still always< always went higher so if you're not very always went higher so if you're not very sure< sure on what stocks to choose you're sure on what stocks to choose you're afraid< afraid of choosing the wrong stock then afraid of choosing the wrong stock then you< you want to go for broad-based index you want to go for broad-based index etfs etfs etfs now< now next let's talk a little bit about now next let's talk a little bit about entries< entries and exits right so the first entries and exits right so the first thing< thing we're going to talk about is thing we're going to talk about is selling< selling the cash check output now when selling the cash check output now when i'm< i'm selling the cashing output i'm selling the cashing output we< we always want to have a margin of we always want to have a margin of safety< safety by entering only when the stock safety by entering only when the stock is< is oversold so when the stock is is oversold so when the stock is oversold< oversold basically uh this is the oversold basically uh this is the indicator< indicator which i use is stochastic so indicator which i use is stochastic so when< when the stochastic when the stochastic has< has a reading that is over so then that has a reading that is over so then that is< is when i start to sell is when i start to sell the< the cash secure output because i do want the cash secure output because i do want to< to ensure that the moment if my cash to ensure that the moment if my cash crop< crop will get assigned that there's a crop will get assigned that there's a good< good chance for the market to go back up good chance for the market to go back up right< right so it's much better for you to right so it's much better for you to enter< enter when the stock is oversold rather enter when the stock is oversold rather than< than when it's overbought right so than when it's overbought right so because< because when it's overbought there's a because when it's overbought there's a there's< there's a higher probability that the there's a higher probability that the market< market is going to go down right so we market is going to go down right so we want< want to be much more smarter and want to be much more smarter and strategic< strategic in our entries and we also strategic in our entries and we also want< want to enter when there is a support want to enter when there is a support level< level so i'm going to explain this later level so i'm going to explain this later on< on in the chart on in the chart and< and the third thing that you want to do and the third thing that you want to do so< so this is a little bit of uh advanced so this is a little bit of uh advanced concept< concept which is to stagger entries into concept which is to stagger entries into several< several levels right so if you have several levels right so if you have enough< enough funds so let's say for example enough funds so let's say for example you< you have ten thousand dollars dedicated you have ten thousand dollars dedicated to to to this< this stock to do your wheel strategy so this stock to do your wheel strategy so instead< instead of putting all 10k into one instead of putting all 10k into one level< level you want to split them into level you want to split them into several< several levels right maybe you split several levels right maybe you split them< them into three levels so you put in a 3 them into three levels so you put in a 3 300< 300 for each level all right so that 300 for each level all right so that means< means you want to look for stocks there means you want to look for stocks there around< around the 20 to 30 around the 20 to 30 range< range right because when you do this range right because when you do this you< you will increase the probability of you will increase the probability of generating< generating the triple income at lower generating the triple income at lower levels< levels right so for example levels right so for example let's< let's say you sell the cash to coupon let's say you sell the cash to coupon okay okay okay and< and the market goes up and then it goes and the market goes up and then it goes down< down let's say it goes down and it takes down let's say it goes down and it takes a< a long time for it to finally come up a long time for it to finally come up right< right it goes down doing though so right it goes down doing though so during< during this period of time you actually during this period of time you actually do< do you can't really make anything right do you can't really make anything right because< because the stock may have gone so far because the stock may have gone so far down< down that you're not able to sell a down that you're not able to sell a covered< covered call at your break-even point at covered call at your break-even point at the< the very least right or even higher the very least right or even higher so< so you get stuck down here so instead of so you get stuck down here so instead of doing< doing this you want to be splitting them doing this you want to be splitting them into< into three different levels so basically into three different levels so basically what< what you want to be doing is is what you want to be doing is is something< something like this right say let's say something like this right say let's say you< you sell the cashew cutput you sell the cashew cutput first< first level first level so< so once it comes down you sell another so once it comes down you sell another cashier< cashier put down here cashier put down here and< and if the stock continues to go down and if the stock continues to go down right< right you sell another cashier output right you sell another cashier output so< so this way even though if the market so this way even though if the market doesn't< doesn't recover doesn't recover right< right to the first level at least this right to the first level at least this first< first few levels you're still able to first few levels you're still able to sell sell sell cover< cover calls to try and get more cover calls to try and get more profits< profits right to get some profits going profits right to get some profits going on< on down here so i'll show you more a on down here so i'll show you more a little< little bit more in the little bit more in the charts< charts now charts now the< the thing to take note is that there's a the thing to take note is that there's a trade-off< trade-off that means that you won't make trade-off that means that you won't make as< as much if the stock rallies after as much if the stock rallies after filling< filling at the first level compared to filling at the first level compared to one< one entry level so this is what i mean one entry level so this is what i mean right< right so let's say for example the stock right so let's say for example the stock was< was to just dip into your first level of was to just dip into your first level of your your your cashier< cashier output right so let's say this cashier output right so let's say this is< is just one entry if it comes down here is just one entry if it comes down here all< all right let's say you are now assigned all right let's say you are now assigned 100< 100 shares 100 shares and< and then the stock goes up so perfect and then the stock goes up so perfect everything< everything is good down here because you everything is good down here because you only< only have one level but if you had three only have one level but if you had three levels< levels let's say you have another two levels let's say you have another two levels< levels below down here levels below down here now< now it doesn't get filled on your two now it doesn't get filled on your two levels< levels so that means that your profit is levels so that means that your profit is only< only one third of what it should be only one third of what it should be right< right because if you had a single level right because if you had a single level you< you will put let's say uh ten thousand you will put let's say uh ten thousand dollars< dollars in your capital into this level dollars in your capital into this level let's< let's say for example you have allotted let's say for example you have allotted ten< ten thousand dollars uh for this ten thousand dollars uh for this strategy< strategy on this trade right but if you strategy on this trade right but if you were< were to split into three levels right were to split into three levels right this< this would be only 3. 3 k this would be only 3.

3 k all< all right one third of it and then this all. right one third of it and then this will< will be another 3. 3 k will be another 3.

3 k and< and that means you only have one third and that means you only have one third of< of the size as the market goes up that of the size as the market goes up that means< means your profit is being reduced by means your profit is being reduced by two-thirds< two-thirds all right so that is the two-thirds all right so that is the trade-off< trade-off now trade-off now i'm< i'm gonna go through the sum charts so i'm gonna go through the sum charts so you< you can take a little bit later you can take a little bit later now< now next is selling the cover call now now next is selling the cover call now cover< cover call basically what you want to do cover call basically what you want to do is< is sell only when the stock is is sell only when the stock is overbought< overbought and also above a resistance overbought and also above a resistance level level level and< and if you have several cash output you and if you have several cash output you can< can stagger your cover cost into several can stagger your cover cost into several levels< levels now this will be on a levels now this will be on a discretionary< discretionary basis so as you see the discretionary basis so as you see the market< market goes up you can just place the market goes up you can just place the cover< cover call cover call as< as the. stock goes up now i've also as the stock goes up now i've also created< created a video on the cover call the created a video on the cover call the blueprint< blueprint on the strike selection so you blueprint on the strike selection so you can< can go ahead and watch that can go ahead and watch that all< all right so let's get into a trade all right so let's get into a trade example< example so this is for the single entry example so this is for the single entry level< level so you can get a better level so you can get a better understanding< understanding of what i mean here so understanding of what i mean here so we< we can see down here what we want to do we can see down here what we want to do is< is wait for the stock to be oversold is wait for the stock to be oversold first< first so as you can see down here this first so as you can see down here this is< is oversold is oversold and< and then the market is down here but the and then the market is down here but the thing< thing is there is no support level here thing is there is no support level here so< so whereas the next nearest support so whereas the next nearest support level level level is< is around this price right so this price is around this price right so this price is< is around 135. so what you want to do is is around 135.

so what you want to do is you< you want to sell a cash output either at you want to sell a cash output either at this< this level or slightly lower than that this level or slightly lower than that right< right if you're more conservative so i right if you're more conservative so i tend< tend to be more conservative so i want tend to be more conservative so i want to< to sell at one three zero to sell at one three zero so< so that's what i'll do so i'll place the so that's what i'll do so i'll place the cash< cash output at one three zero and from cash output at one three zero and from this< this point on what we'll do is just wait this point on what we'll do is just wait and< and see what happens next right so the and see what happens next right so the stock< stock continues to go all the way down stock continues to go all the way down so< so indeed it went past our cashier's so indeed it went past our cashier's output< output and let's say at this point output and let's say at this point our our our cash< cash cut put gets assigned right we get cash cut put gets assigned right we get assigned< assigned and we are now long 100 shares assigned and we are now long 100 shares so< so the next step what we're gonna do is so the next step what we're gonna do is we< we just have to wait for the market to we just have to wait for the market to go< go back up a little bit first so we can go back up a little bit first so we can start< start selling the cover cost so at this start selling the cover cost so at this point< point of time the market went up now point of time the market went up now there< there is an overbought all right you can there is an overbought all right you can see< see it's overbought on the stochastic so see it's overbought on the stochastic so this< this is where we want to sell our cover this is where we want to sell our cover call call call so< so down here now when you're selling the so down here now when you're selling the cover< cover call you can of course sell it one cover call you can of course sell it one three< three zero right you get more premium three zero right you get more premium but< but the thing is that although you get but the thing is that although you get more< more premium you do not get any capital more premium you do not get any capital gains< gains from the underlying stock so what gains from the underlying stock so what we< we ideally want is to get a capital gain we ideally want is to get a capital gain from< from the underlying stock right so from the underlying stock right so instead< instead of selling our cover coin 130 instead of selling our cover coin 130 we'll< we'll be selling at one three five so we'll be selling at one three five so this< this way if the market goes up and it this way if the market goes up and it closes< closes above closes above the< the cover call the cover call right< right at expiration then we will be right at expiration then we will be getting< getting this profit down here as well getting this profit down here as well so< so once you place the cover call next so once you place the cover call next thing< thing you do is just wait and see what thing you do is just wait and see what happens happens happens so< so the stock unfortunately went all the so the stock unfortunately went all the way< way back down again right at this point way back down again right at this point of< of time you can see it's oversold of time you can see it's oversold so< so now that it's oversold there's no so now that it's oversold there's no point< point for us to keep the cover call point for us to keep the cover call because< because we have probably because we have probably made< made quite a bit of the profits or the made quite a bit of the profits or the premium< premium that we received from the cover premium that we received from the cover call< call so it's time for us to close this call so it's time for us to close this cover< cover call so what we will do is we go cover call so what we will do is we go ahead< ahead and close the cover call ahead and close the cover call so< so at this point we wait for the stock so at this point we wait for the stock to< to go up again wait until we receive or to go up again wait until we receive or we< we see an overbought signal and then we we see an overbought signal and then we sell< sell our cover call again all right so sell our cover call again all right so this< this time we sell at 135 again this time we sell at 135 again and< and then and then subsequently< subsequently you can see the market gap subsequently you can see the market gap up< up although on a very negative or rather up although on a very negative or rather uh< uh not so good earnings. as you can see uh not so good earnings as you can see down< down here the market did gap up and then down here the market did gap up and then at< at this point in time we just wait to at this point in time we just wait to see< see whether we are assigned on the cover see whether we are assigned on the cover card< card we are signing a cover call that's card we are signing a cover call that's good< good right our shares get called away good right our shares get called away and< and then we can sell our cash output and then we can sell our cash output basically< basically just wait until the basically just wait until the stochastics< stochastics uh go down again and then it stochastics uh go down again and then it becomes< becomes oversold we can sell our cash becomes oversold we can sell our cash account< account put if it doesn't uh get us account put if it doesn't uh get us called< called away it goes down here back down called away it goes down here back down again< again what we can do is we can sell again what we can do is we can sell another< another cup call another cup call and< and then just wait again right so and then just wait again right so basically< basically this is the single entry level basically this is the single entry level okay okay okay now< now what about multiple entry levels so now what about multiple entry levels so this< this is what i mean so instead of this is what i mean so instead of placing< placing one cache output will be selling placing one cache output will be selling multiple< multiple cash output as the market drops multiple cash output as the market drops now< now remember there is no difference to now remember there is no difference to the< the risk allocation right in the single the risk allocation right in the single entry< entry level if you had ten thousand entry level if you had ten thousand dollars< dollars allocated to that stock for the dollars allocated to that stock for the real< real strategy then you'll be putting all real strategy then you'll be putting all ten< ten thousand dollars for the cash secure ten thousand dollars for the cash secure put< put right that's assuming ten thousand put right that's assuming ten thousand dollars< dollars is also part of your uh dollars is also part of your uh portfolio< portfolio size right maybe you have like portfolio size right maybe you have like a< a hundred thousand dollars right let's a hundred thousand dollars right let's just< just say for example just say for example now now now for< for the multiple entry levels for the multiple entry levels if< if you have allocated ten thousand if you have allocated ten thousand dollars< dollars you do not change the amount so dollars you do not change the amount so instead< instead of putting you know ten thousand instead of putting you know ten thousand dollars< dollars to one of this all right so now dollars to one of this all right so now in< in this case realistically because uh in this case realistically because uh this< this stock amazon is twelve thousand this stock amazon is twelve thousand or< or thirteen thousand dollars if you get or thirteen thousand dollars if you get feed< feed on this so realistically you need feed on this so realistically you need about< about forty thousand dollars right for about forty thousand dollars right for three< three levels so instead of uh forty three levels so instead of uh forty thousand< thousand dollars you put into one level thousand dollars you put into one level what< what you wanna do is to split them into what you wanna do is to split them into multiple< multiple levels so this is how it works multiple levels so this is how it works again< again you can see this is oversold again you can see this is oversold all< all right so you'll be selling your all right so you'll be selling your cancer< cancer carpool on the first level cancer carpool on the first level then< then we'll wait for it to see what then we'll wait for it to see what happens< happens so at this point of time the happens so at this point of time the market< market went down so when it goes down market went down so when it goes down below< below the first cash secure output level below the first cash secure output level now< now we can we can sell a second cash now we can we can sell a second cash secure< secure output level now where do we secure output level now where do we place< place the second cash output level we're place the second cash output level we're going< going to put it roughly around five to going to put it roughly around five to ten< ten percent apart right so in this case ten percent apart right so in this case is< is close to ten 10 is close to ten 10 so< so let's take our calculator here so so let's take our calculator here so let's< let's see let's see uh< uh what do we have down here so just 15 uh what do we have down here so just 15 points< points right so 15 points points right so 15 points from< from 130 to 115 divided by 130 from 130 to 115 divided by 130 so< so this is roughly 11. 5 percent right so so this is roughly 11.

5 percent right so it's< it's 11. 5 percent difference from uh it's 11.

5 percent difference from uh here< here to here here to here okay< okay so we're going to. be selling uh okay so we're going to be selling uh cash< cash a cupboard level 2 at 115. so once cash a cupboard level 2 at 115.

so once we< we sold this we win and see what happens we sold this we win and see what happens so< so as the market drops even lower we now so as the market drops even lower we now sell< sell our third sell our third uh uh uh kessick< kessick output level right so level kessick output level right so level three< three so we split our uh three so we split our uh allocation< allocation for this stock to three allocation for this stock to three levels< levels so after this three levels we do levels so after this three levels we do not< not enter anymore if the market con not enter anymore if the market con subsequently< subsequently goes all the way down what subsequently goes all the way down what we'll be< we'll be doing is we'll be holding on to we'll be doing is we'll be holding on to the< the stock until it finally recovers the stock until it finally recovers right< right so right so once< once we have sold this cash once we have sold this cash uh< uh cash secure output level three now uh cash secure output level three now what< what we do is just wait and see what what we do is just wait and see what happens< happens so let's say at this point in happens so let's say at this point in time< time let's say we are now assigned on time let's say we are now assigned on our< our caching output level one right so our caching output level one right so now< now we are along 100 shares at 130 now we are along 100 shares at 130 dollars< dollars so at this point of time there's dollars so at this point of time there's nothing< nothing to do we just wait and see if nothing to do we just wait and see if the< the market goes up or goes down the market goes up or goes down so< so this at this point in time. the market so this at this point in time the market goes< goes up now it is overbought so what do goes up now it is overbought so what do we< we do when it's overbought that's right we do when it's overbought that's right we< we sell a covered call so as you can see we sell a covered call so as you can see we< we sell a cover call at 135 right so we sell a cover call at 135 right so this< this time we can get a capital gain in this time we can get a capital gain in case< case the market does go up and then it case the market does go up and then it closes< closes above our cover call and if it closes above our cover call and if it does< does uh cash output level 2 and level 3 does uh cash output level 2 and level 3 would< would expire worthless this way we'll be would expire worthless this way we'll be able< able to gain the full premium which we able to gain the full premium which we sold< sold it for sold it for so< so let's see what happens so in this so let's see what happens so in this case< case the market went back down so as it case the market went back down so as it went< went back down what do we do once we see went back down what do we do once we see that< that it's oversold we can close our that it's oversold we can close our cover< cover call so we'll go ahead and close cover call so we'll go ahead and close our< our cover call and let's say at this our cover call and let's say at this point point point our< our cash output level 2 has been our cash output level 2 has been assigned< assigned to us right so now we are also assigned to us right so now we are also long< long 100 shares at 115. now when we do long 100 shares at 115.

now when we do this< this we want to ensure that we see them this we want to ensure that we see them as< as two separate orders right 100 shares as two separate orders right 100 shares here< here and 100 shares at this point here and 100 shares at this point because< because we're gonna be selling cover because we're gonna be selling cover call< call uh separately for this two call uh separately for this two different< different levels right on your platform different levels right on your platform they< they may merge it as one order right they may merge it as one order right they< they will take it as 200 shares and they they will take it as 200 shares and they will< will take the average price at probably will take the average price at probably around< around one to two point five right so around one to two point five right so you< you need to keep a a log of this on your you need to keep a a log of this on your spreadsheet< spreadsheet so you know exactly where spreadsheet so you know exactly where you< you went long okay so at this point of you went long okay so at this point of time< time cash you could put uh output level time cash you could put uh output level 3< 3 has still not been breached so at this 3 has still not been breached so at this point< point of time point of time they< they still consider out of the money they still consider out of the money so< so let's see what happens next so let's so let's see what happens next so let's say< say for example at this point in time say for example at this point in time our< our cash output level 3 is now expired our cash output level 3 is now expired so< so now when it's expired what do we do so now when it's expired what do we do we< we can always sell another cash to cut we can always sell another cash to cut put< put down here so we sell a cash output put down here so we sell a cash output let's< let's take a look at what happens now let's take a look at what happens now that< that it has gone up right again now we that it has gone up right again now we have< have this over have this over bought< bought signal what do we do now we sell bought signal what do we do now we sell cover< cover calls right now we sell cover cover calls right now we sell cover calls< calls now we can sell two cover calls calls now we can sell two cover calls because< because we have 200 shares we can sell because we have 200 shares we can sell cover< cover call for this cover call for this and< and we can sell a covered call for this and we can sell a covered call for this so< so remember as i mentioned earlier on we so remember as i mentioned earlier on we can< can stagger our exits just as the same can stagger our exits just as the same way< way we staggered our entries right so we way we staggered our entries right so we can< can stagger our covered calls on the way can stagger our covered calls on the way up< up so in this case you may want to sell up so in this case you may want to sell a< a cover call at 135 and then you can a cover call at 135 and then you can sell< sell a cover call at 1408 as well and sell a cover call at 1408 as well and let's< let's just wait and see what happens let's just wait and see what happens right< right so in this case as you can see if right so in this case as you can see if the< the market goes up and it closes above the market goes up and it closes above this< this two cover calls and expiration then this two cover calls and expiration then we're< we're going to have our this 200 shares we're going to have our this 200 shares called< called away so we're going to be making called away so we're going to be making a< a lot of uh profits in this case right a lot of uh profits in this case right because< because we'll be making the premium from because we'll be making the premium from the< the cash output which we sold from down the cash output which we sold from down here< here uh cash output here and the two here uh cash output here and the two cashing< cashing output that we sold down here cashing output that we sold down here right< right we sold two cash account put down right we sold two cash account put down here here here and< and in this case you will be also and in this case you will be also receiving< receiving our cover call profits from receiving our cover call profits from this this this this< this and where we sold one earlier when this and where we sold one earlier when the< the market went up somewhere down here the market went up somewhere down here we< we sold one cash cover call down here at we sold one cash cover call down here at the< the same time we'll be getting our uh the same time we'll be getting our uh intrinsic< intrinsic value game from the underlying intrinsic value game from the underlying stock< stock our capital gains right so maybe stock our capital gains right so maybe this< this will be considered the intrinsic this will be considered the intrinsic value< value gain the capital gains from this value gain the capital gains from this price< price the beast price 115 to 135 and price the beast price 115 to 135 and then< then for this from one three zero to one then for this from one three zero to one four< four zero so this will be the capital four zero so this will be the capital gains< gains here so as you can see when you gains here so as you can see when you split< split them into split them into multiple< multiple entry levels yes there's more multiple entry levels yes there's more things< things to. do but it also means that you things to do but it also means that you have< have a higher chance of more profits have a higher chance of more profits right< right because you no longer get stuck in right because you no longer get stuck in a< a position compared to before right a position compared to before right before< before if you had just only one order before if you had just only one order at< at this price if the market just stayed at this price if the market just stayed below< below down here and does nothing you below down here and does nothing you know< know you you pretty much for a period of know you you pretty much for a period of let's< let's say from may all the way to maybe let's say from may all the way to maybe even< even august right there's really not even august right there's really not much< much you can do in terms of selling that much you can do in terms of selling that much< much premium or even getting any much premium or even getting any intrinsic< intrinsic value gained because the intrinsic value gained because the market< market has always gone below the entry market has always gone below the entry price< price of where you got long 100 shares price of where you got long 100 shares right< right but then if you were to right but then if you were to split< split them into multiple entry levels split them into multiple entry levels you< you can see that it's much easier for you can see that it's much easier for you< you to gain on any of this right so you to gain on any of this right so let's< let's say in the event if the market did let's say in the event if the market did come< come down here and then now you're long come down here and then now you're long 100< 100 shares guess what right if this gets 100 shares guess what right if this gets up< up here up here down< down here you can start to sell another down here you can start to sell another cover< cover call so you'll be making profits cover call so you'll be making profits at< at the bottom level first so even though at the bottom level first so even though if< if the first two levels have no chance if the first two levels have no chance to< to get any intrinsic value gain from the to get any intrinsic value gain from the underlying< underlying stock your last level can underlying stock your last level can always< always have a chance for you to gain the always have a chance for you to gain the intrinsic< intrinsic level and let's say the market intrinsic level and let's say the market just< just bounces back and forth at the just bounces back and forth at the bottom bottom bottom right< right for a long time before it right for a long time before it eventually< eventually goes up then guess what then eventually goes up then guess what then your< your third level will always be making your third level will always be making the< the cash output and then the intrinsic the cash output and then the intrinsic value< value from the stock as well as the value from the stock as well as the premium< premium from the cover call so you have premium from the cover call so you have the< the triple income just on the last level the triple income just on the last level alone< alone before you can alone before you can gain< gain the triple income from the other gain the triple income from the other two< two levels all right guys this is quite two levels all right guys this is quite a< a little bit to take in but i want you a little bit to take in but i want you to< to go back and rewatch this part again to go back and rewatch this part again if< if you're not very sure but this is a if you're not very sure but this is a very< very good way for you to ensure that very good way for you to ensure that you're< you're always getting something as the you're always getting something as the market< market is moving right as the market market is moving right as the market goes< goes up and down especially if it goes up and down especially if it continues< continues to go down continues to go down right< right if you split them into multiple right if you split them into multiple entry< entry levels you're ensuring that you're entry levels you're ensuring that you're always< always getting an income at the lower always getting an income at the lower levels< levels if you were to just keep them to levels if you were to just keep them to just< just one level just like uh the earlier just one level just like uh the earlier example< example which i showed you just for example which i showed you just for example< example if you were to just sell this example if you were to just sell this level< level just level one without anything level just level one without anything else< else then if the market goes all the way else then if the market goes all the way down< down here you're not going to be getting down here you're not going to be getting anything< anything right so it it becomes much anything right so it it becomes much more< more strategic much better in my opinion more strategic much better in my opinion if< if you have enough funds of course to if you have enough funds of course to split< split them into multiple levels all split them into multiple levels all right< right guys so that's it for this video i right guys so that's it for this video i hope< hope you have enjoyed it and found it hope you have enjoyed it and found it helpful< helpful if you have please

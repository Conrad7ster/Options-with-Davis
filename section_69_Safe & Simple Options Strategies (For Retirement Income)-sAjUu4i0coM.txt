========================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you a few I'm going to be sharing with you a few safe< safe and simple option strategies that safe and simple option strategies that are< are going to be suitable as a form of are going to be suitable as a form of retirement< retirement income so if you are planning retirement income so if you are planning for< for your retirement or maybe you're for your retirement or maybe you're already< already at your retirement age and you already at your retirement age and you want< want option strategies that you know are want option strategies that you know are generally< generally safe then these are strategies generally safe then these are strategies that< that you can use now before I actually that you can use now before I actually get< get into the option strategies I want to get into the option strategies I want to first< first talk about the characteristics of first talk about the characteristics of the< the option strategies that we are going the option strategies that we are going to< to choose right so this is going to be to choose right so this is going to be important< important because some of the option important because some of the option strategies< strategies you know out there in the strategies you know out there in the options< options world could be a little bit options world could be a little bit risky< risky so here are a few characteristics risky so here are a few characteristics that< that I think are going to be suitable as that I think are going to be suitable as a< a form of retirement income now the very a form of retirement income now the very first< first characteristic is that we're going first characteristic is that we're going to< to be getting into option strategies to be getting into option strategies that< that does not require us to get long that does not require us to get long shares< shares right so basically we do not want shares right so basically we do not want to< to get assigned that means that we're to get assigned that means that we're not< not going to get into strategies like not going to get into strategies like the< the cash secure put or the Buel strategy the cash secure put or the Buel strategy right< right so the whole idea here is to get right so the whole idea here is to get into< into the option and then get out of the into the option and then get out of the options< options this way it's much more clean options this way it's much more clean and< and neat and also uh this option and neat and also uh this option strategies< strategies we are generally going to strategies we are generally going to hold< hold them you know for not too long so hold them you know for not too long so these< these are going to be short duration these are going to be short duration trades< trades where the holding time is trades where the holding time is somewhere< somewhere from 24 to 45 days and I'm somewhere from 24 to 45 days and I'm going< going to explain a little bit later on going to explain a little bit later on why< why this is so now you might be why this is so now you might be wondering< wondering you know Davis what about wondering you know Davis what about these< these shorter time frames right like for these shorter time frames right like for example< example maybe 7 days one week or maybe example maybe 7 days one week or maybe zero< zero DTE now I'm not a very big fan of zero DTE now I'm not a very big fan of those< those strategies where you know know the those strategies where you know know the time< time frame is very short and I'm again time frame is very short and I'm again I'm< I'm going to explain to you why later on I'm going to explain to you why later on now< now the next characteristic is that we now the next characteristic is that we are< are only going to choose option are only going to choose option strategies< strategies where there's only risk to strategies where there's only risk to one< one side now there are two reasons to one side now there are two reasons to this< this the very first reason is that it's this the very first reason is that it's much< much easier to manage right if there's much easier to manage right if there's only< only risk to one side we only have to only risk to one side we only have to worry< worry about that and then we manage worry about that and then we manage according< according to that and the next one is according to that and the next one is that< that we're going to have a very that we're going to have a very strategic< strategic way to select the underlying strategic way to select the underlying so< so in this case for this strategies that so in. this case for this strategies that we're< we're going to use as a formal re income we're going to use as a formal re income we< we generally only want to choose we generally only want to choose positive< positive drift stocks and ETFs right so positive drift stocks and ETFs right so this< this way you know if we know that the this way you know if we know that the market< market is going to keep going up over market is going to keep going up over the< the long term and we're going to stick the long term and we're going to stick to< to strategies where there's only risk to to strategies where there's only risk to the< the downside then this way we know it the downside then this way we know it it's< it's going to be less riskier and much it's going to be less riskier and much safer< safer and again I'm going to go in depth safer and again I'm going to go in depth into< into this when we get into the into this when we get into the strategies< strategies now next we're going to get strategies now next we're going to get into< into also only safe strategies and what into also only safe strategies and what this< this means is that we are going to get this means is that we are going to get into< into strategies where the max risk is into strategies where the max risk is kept< kept on each trade so we won't be kept on each trade so we won't be getting< getting into strategies where it's getting into strategies where it's undefined< undefined whereby you know if the market undefined whereby you know if the market has< has a very big adverse move you can lose has a very big adverse move you can lose a< a lot so we're not going to get into a lot so we're not going to get into those< those strategies and finally uh the last those strategies and finally uh the last characteristic< characteristic is that you can even characteristic is that you can even trade< trade it with a very small account all trade it with a very small account all right< right so now without further Ado let's right so now without further Ado let's get< get into the actual strategies starting get into the actual strategies starting with< with the very first one and I'm going to with the very first one and I'm going to be< be sharing with you a total of three be sharing with you a total of three retirement< retirement income strategies right so retirement income strategies right so the< the very first one is the short put the very first one is the short put spread< spread also known as the put credit spread also known as the put credit spread< spread spread so for those of you who spread spread so for those of you who are< are not already familiar of what the are not already familiar of what the short< short putut spread is it's basically short putut spread is it's basically just< just two very simple strategies right just two very simple strategies right you< you have your short putut so this is the you have your short putut so this is the short< short putut on the left hand side down short putut on the left hand side down here< here let me just get my marker so you here let me just get my marker so you have< have the short putut down here and then have the short putut down here and then you< you have the long put down here now the you have the long put down here now the whole< whole idea here of the long putut is to whole idea here of the long putut is to cap< cap the max loss right so this way if cap the max loss right so this way if the< the market really crashes all the way the market really crashes all the way down< down to you know way below uh the down to you know way below uh the current< current market price or maybe even goes current market price or maybe even goes to< to zero you do not have to be worried or to zero you do not have to be worried or afraid< afraid that your account will be wiped afraid that your account will be wiped out< out because your max RIS has already out because your max RIS has already been< been kept by this long put down here been kept by this long put down here right< right so this way all you got to focus right so this way all you got to focus on< on is where you're going to put your on is where you're going to put your short< short put spread so generally we always short put spread so generally we always want< want to put it below where the current want to put it below where the current market< market price is so as you can see down market price is so as you can see down here< here the current market price right now here the current market price right now is< is somewhere around 17 is somewhere around 17 9. 86< 9.

86 right so generally when we put on 9. 86 right so generally when we put on the< the short put right we want the market the short put right we want the market to< to either just go somewhere sideways or to either just go somewhere sideways or maybe< maybe go down but above our putut spread maybe go down but above our putut spread or< or go up right so as you can see with or go up right so as you can see with the< the short put spread depending on how the short put spread depending on how you< you actually place it there are actually you actually place it there are actually many< many ways that you can profit from it many ways that you can profit from it right< right so this is much better than if you right so this is much better than if you were< were to just trade outright right if you were to just trade outright right if you were< were to just trade the outright were to just trade the outright underlying< underlying let's say for example you underlying let's say for example you were< were to just buy at this point down here were to just buy at this point down here if< if the market goes up you make money but if the market goes up you make money but if< if the market goes down you lose money if the market goes down you lose money but< but with the short putut spread and if but with the short putut spread and if you< you were to put the short put spread you you were to put the short put spread you know< know very strategically at certain know very strategically at certain places< places which I'm going to share with you places which I'm going to share with you later< later on then there are you know a few later on then there are you know a few ways< ways that you can actually win if the ways that you can actually win if the market< market goes up you'll be Prett in profit market goes up you'll be Prett in profit if< if the market goes sideways you still if the market goes sideways you still can< can be in profit and if the market goes can be in profit and if the market goes down< down and it doesn't get below your short down and it doesn't get below your short putut< putut spread you can actually Ste profit putut spread you can actually Ste profit now< now let's get into the DTE selection now let's get into the DTE selection which< which means is the day days to which means is the day days to expiration< expiration right how many days left does expiration right how many days left does the< the option have to expiration so how the option have to expiration so how long< long do we want it to be so for me long do we want it to be so for me generally< generally I like to go for somewhere generally I like to go for somewhere above< above 45 DTE and the main reason is above 45 DTE and the main reason is because< because we have a positive Edge right because we have a positive Edge right the< the positive Edge is where the RM which the positive Edge is where the RM which means< means the realized move is more often means the realized move is more often the< the time lesser than the expected move the time lesser than the expected move now< now I already explained this in detail now I already explained this in detail in< in another my video called the number in another my video called the number one< one secret to getting consistent profits one secret to getting consistent profits uh< uh if you haven't watched that just go uh if you haven't watched that just go ahead< ahead to my channel and you will see ahead to my channel and you will see that< that video now the main thing about this that video now the main thing about this you< you need to know is that when you go for you need to know is that when you go for the< the uh DTE that is above 45 you are the uh DTE that is above 45 you are going< going to win more often than the going to win more often than the probability< probability of the trade suggests right probability of the trade suggests right so< so I'm going to share with you the main so I'm going to share with you the main reason< reason why we have an edge above 45 DTE reason why we have an edge above 45 DTE and< and it's because of this table down here and it's because of this table down here that< that the tasty trade team have already that the tasty trade team have already done< done so this table down here is very done so this table down here is very significant< significant in in terms of the significant in in terms of the statistics< statistics because you can see over here statistics because you can see over here this< this data collection has been since 1993 this data collection has been since 1993 so< so this is quite a long time so as you so this is quite a long time so as you can< can see over here if you notice there can see over here if you notice there are< are two boxes that I have uh boxed out are two boxes that I have uh boxed out here< here you have the red box and you have here you have the red box and you have the< the green box down here so the edge Lies the green box down here so the edge Lies when< when the realized move is less than the when the realized move is less than the expected< expected move that means the expected expected move that means the expected move< move is greater than the rise move so a move is greater than the rise move so a very< very quick uh graphical representation very quick uh graphical representation of< of what Ian is that this is the expected of what Ian is that this is the expected move< move expected move is basically depicted move expected move is basically depicted by< by the mathematical model which is all by the mathematical model which is all baked< baked into the options probability so baked into the options probability so it's< it's trying to tell you that there's a it's trying to tell you that there's a certain< certain percentage that you will stay certain percentage that you will stay within< within uh this Zone down here right within uh this Zone down here right let's< let's say from here to here but the let's say from here to here but the actual< actual realized move is much smaller so actual realized move is much smaller so that< that means to say the actual move that that means to say the actual move that actually< actually happens in the market is actually happens in the market is actually< actually lesser than this so why this is actually lesser than this so why this is going< going to be an edge for us is basically going to be an edge for us is basically it< it just means that we're going to win it just means that we're going to win more< more often than we actually should more often than we actually should skewing< skewing the win rate in our favor which skewing the win rate in our favor which overall< overall will make the whole trade overall will make the whole trade profitable< profitable for us over the long term profitable for us over the long term okay< okay so as you can see down here this is okay so as you can see down here this is the< the study already done by the TD trade the study already done by the TD trade where< where they did it on spy just to measure where they did it on spy just to measure you< you know the expected Move versus the you know the expected Move versus the realized< realized move so after you know many realized move so after you know many many< many statistics that have been collected many statistics that have been collected you< you can see that anywhere from 7 days to you can see that anywhere from 7 days to 30< 30 days you notice that the expected 30 days you notice that the expected move< move is actually not bigger than the move is actually not bigger than the realized< realized move right so you can see the realized move right so you can see the expected< expected move based on you know the expected move based on you know the mathematical< mathematical calculation of the options mathematical calculation of the options it< it says that it's going to be of a it says that it's going to be of a certain< certain percentage right as you can see certain percentage right as you can see down< down here it's not going to be very much down here it's not going to be very much different< different from the actual realized move different from the actual realized move right< right this is actually when the market right this is actually when the market already< already moved right what it has happened already moved right what it has happened in< in the market you can see that is in the market you can see that is actually< actually not that much of a difference actually not that much of a difference in< in fact in all the cases down here from in fact in all the cases down here from 7< 7 to 30 days is actually bigger which 7 to 30 days is actually bigger which means< means to say your realiz move instead of means to say your realiz move instead of it< it being smaller right it's now bigger it being smaller right it's now bigger what< what this implies by the way this is what this implies by the way this is supposed< supposed to be a straight line forgive supposed to be a straight line forgive me< me for not being able to draw this me for not being able to draw this properly< properly but basically the implications properly but basically the implications is< is that the opposite happens instead of is that the opposite happens instead of winning< winning more often than you should now winning more often than you should now you're< you're actually winning less than you you're actually winning less than you should< should which means to say you're going should which means to say you're going to< to lose a lot more which going to skew to lose a lot more which going to skew the< the whole probability against you and the whole probability against you and it's< it's not going to work out in the long it's not going to work out in the long term< term right now but what if it's 45 days term right now but what if it's 45 days and< and above so as you can see down here and above so as you can see down here below< below the one where I boxed out in green below the one where I boxed out in green you< you can see for any time above 45 days you can see for any time above 45 days you< you will notice that the expected move you will notice that the expected move is< is bigger than the realized move that is bigger than the realized move that means< means we have the edge right in the long means we have the edge right in the long term< term it's going to work out for us we're term it's going to work out for us we're going< going to be positive expectancy because going to be positive expectancy because of< of this very reason down here okay so of this very reason down here okay so this< this is the main reason why I like to this is the main reason why I like to choose< choose the DTE that's above 45 and not choose the DTE that's above 45 and not below< below that so if you're going to go below that so if you're going to go below< below that now doesn't mean that you're below that now doesn't mean that you're not< not going to make money you still can not going to make money you still can make< make money it's it's just that the make money it's it's just that the chance< chance of you actually making money from chance of you actually making money from the< the expected move strategies is going to the expected move strategies is going to be< be a little bit harder right in order be a little bit harder right in order for< for you to profit in the shorter term for you to profit in the shorter term you< you probably have to be more you probably have to be more directionally< directionally right right so if you're directionally right right so if you're not< not very good at picking directions then not very good at picking directions then you< you probably might want to go for above you probably might want to go for above 45< 45 DTE now next let's talk about 45 DTE now next let's talk about underlying< underlying selection so for this because underlying selection so for this because we're< we're trading the short put spread the we're trading the short put spread the short< short put spread is generally a bullish short put spread is generally a bullish strategy< strategy that means for the most part we strategy that means for the most part we want< want the market to go up right if the want the market to go up right if the market< market goes down then we're going to market goes down then we're going to lose< lose money so for this a lot of people lose money so for this a lot of people this< this is where I notice actually tend to this is where I notice actually tend to go< go wrong right they just choose the go wrong right they just choose the strategy< strategy based on short putut and try to strategy based on short putut and try to find< find you know areas where they think the find you know areas where they think the market< market is going to go up just through market is going to go up just through technical< technical analysis now nothing wrong technical analysis now nothing wrong with< with that but I think that you can with that but I think that you can actually< actually you know add an additional actually you know add an additional layer< layer to your favor like can add more layer to your favor like can add more you< you know one more criteria to make the you know one more criteria to make the probability< probability skewed in your favor and probability skewed in your favor and that< that is to choose fundamentally good that is to choose fundamentally good stocks< stocks as well as the index ETFs because stocks as well as the index ETFs because they< they have positive drift that means the they have positive drift that means the market< market wants to go up over the long term market wants to go up over the long term right< right so for example one of the right so for example one of the fundamentally< fundamentally good stocks that I like fundamentally good stocks that I like and< and I think that it's fundamentally good and I think that it's fundamentally good is< is Google right as you can see Google is Google right as you can see Google has< has just kept going up ever since has just kept going up ever since Inception< Inception so you know at any time Inception so you know at any time whenever< whenever there's a dip if you were to whenever there's a dip if you were to put< put on the put spread then guess what put on the put spread then guess what the< the chances of you actually profiting is the chances of you actually profiting is going< going to be generally higher than if you going to be generally higher than if you were< were going to choose stocks that you were going to choose stocks that you know< know you had no idea where it's going to know you had no idea where it's going to go< go right so that is why you know you go right so that is why you know you want< want to go for fundamentally good stocks want to go for fundamentally good stocks or< or index ETFs and in this case as you or index ETFs and in this case as you can< can see down here this is the S&amp;P 500 can see down here this is the S&amp;P 500 ETF< ETF so the most uh widely traded one ETF so the most uh widely traded one would< would be the Spy right so spy so as you would be the Spy right so spy so as you can< can see down here as well over the long can see down here as well over the long term< term the market just wants to go up so term the market just wants to go up so you're< you're doing yourself really a good you're doing yourself really a good favor< favor a big favor that if you're going favor a big favor that if you're going to< to choose these strategies or rather to choose these strategies or rather you're< you're going to choose this underline you're going to choose this underline that< that you know in the long term it's just that you know in the long term it's just going< going to keep going up you place a put going to keep going up you place a put spread< spread it's going to work out more often spread it's going to work out more often than< than not now if you're just standing out than not now if you're just standing out especially< especially if you're you know new to especially if you're you know new to trading< trading options you consider yourself a trading options you consider yourself a beginner< beginner then the safest is to go with beginner then the safest is to go with index< index ETFs and the reason is because index ETFs and the reason is because they< they are less volatile if they're less they are less volatile if they're less volatile< volatile there's a lesser chance of your volatile there's a lesser chance of your put< put spread going fully in the money and put spread going fully in the money and also< also with index ETFs there's no earnings also with index ETFs there's no earnings or< or individual stock risk right for or individual stock risk right for individual< individual stocks when there's earnings individual stocks when there's earnings as< as you know you know there can be very as you know you know there can be very big< big gaps all right and if there's going big gaps all right and if there's going to< to be a very big gap down that's where to be a very big gap down that's where it's< it's going to hurt the strategy of the it's going to hurt the strategy of the short< short putut spread and also sometimes short putut spread and also sometimes you< you know individual stocks they may you know individual stocks they may release< release certain news where it's going to release certain news where it's going to affect< affect the stock price right for example affect the stock price right for example you< you know if there's going to be a very you know if there's going to be a very bad< bad product launch then the market is bad product launch then the market is going< going to read it as a very negative going to read it as a very negative sentiment< sentiment they're going to sell the sentiment they're going to sell the stock< stock a lot and the market is going to stock a lot and the market is going to get< get down so generally if you want a much get down so generally if you want a much safer< safer trade then you go for the index safer trade then you go for the index ETF< ETF so as you can see down here this is ETF so as you can see down here this is the< the data by the TC trade team again and the data by the TC trade team again and they< they measure the standard deviation move they measure the standard deviation move of< of the stocks versus the ETFs so as you of the stocks versus the ETFs so as you can< can see down here the ETFs you can see can see down here the ETFs you can see most< most of the movement is concentrated in most of the movement is concentrated in a< a very narrow range right which means to a very narrow range right. which means to say< say even though if the market was to go say even though if the market was to go against< against you the chances of it really against you the chances of it really moving< moving much uh greatly against you it's moving much uh greatly against you it's not< not that high compared to stocks where not that high compared to stocks where you< you can see stocks uh the standard you can see stocks uh the standard deviation< deviation move can be pretty big so deviation move can be pretty big so again< again if you want to have you know much again if you want to have you know much safer< safer trades especially in your safer trades especially in your retirement< retirement years you do not want to have retirement years you do not want to have that< that stress you know having to wake up that stress you know having to wake up in< in the middle of the night just to worry in the middle of the night just to worry about< about your position then guess what just about your position then guess what just go< go for the index ETFs all right so how go for the index ETFs all right so how do< do we get into a trade so if you are do we get into a trade so if you are just< just starting out you consider yourself just starting out you consider yourself a< a beginner then what I suggest is to use a beginner then what I suggest is to use what< what is called an overboard or overso what is called an overboard or overso indicator< indicator right so there are two that I indicator right so there are two that I know< know of so far the first one is know of so far the first one is stochastic< stochastic oscillator the other one is stochastic oscillator the other one is RSI< RSI so as you can see down here this is RSI so as you can see down here this is of< of the stochastic uh oscillator right as of the stochastic uh oscillator right as you< you can see there's this two lines over you can see there's this two lines over here< here if it's above this line then it's here if it's above this line then it's considered< considered overboard if it's below is considered overboard if it's below is considered< considered over so so for our purposes considered over so so for our purposes because< because we're trading the short put because we're trading the short put spread< spread which is generally a bullish spread which is generally a bullish trade< trade we want to look out for when the trade we want to look out for when the oscillator< oscillator right is going below this oscillator right is going below this line< line down here and it gets into the line down here and it gets into the oversold< oversold region right so when it gets oversold region right so when it gets into< into the oversold region then there is into the oversold region then there is going< going to be you know a better going to be you know a better probability< probability that the market is going to probability that the market is going to go< go up then it goes down right now that go up then it goes down right now that is< is not to say that the market won't keep is not to say that the market won't keep going< going down after it shows an over so going down after it shows an over so reading< reading remember this is not some kind reading remember this is not some kind of< of a magic indicator that it's going to of a magic indicator that it's going to work< work every single time right like work every single time right like probability< probability is going to work more often probability is going to work more often than< than not and also you need to understand than not and also you need to understand that< that you need to have proper risk that you need to have proper risk management< management in place as well so if you management in place as well so if you want< want to be strategic you generally want want to be strategic you generally want to< to wait until the market is oversold to wait until the market is oversold before< before you you know consider putting on before you you know consider putting on the< the short putut spread why because if the short putut spread why because if you< you think about it this stochastic you think about it this stochastic oscillator< oscillator only has three readings oscillator only has three readings either< either it's overboard somewhere in the either it's overboard somewhere in the middle< middle or it's oversold now if you think middle or it's oversold now if you think about< about it which one do you think is much about it which one do you think is much more< more strategic to place a short put more strategic to place a short put spread< spread when the market is overboard or spread when the market is overboard or when< when it's over so now generally of when it's over so now generally of course< course when it's oversold right so as course when it's oversold right so as you< you can see over here this is of Google you can see over here this is of Google like< like I mentioned this is one of those like I mentioned this is one of those fundamental< fundamental stocks now by the way how do fundamental stocks now by the way how do you< you determine whether a stock is you determine whether a stock is fundamentally< fundamentally good or not now there are fundamentally good or not now there are many< many aspect to this but generally one of many aspect to this but generally one of the< the ways I like to see is look at the the ways I like to see is look at the track< track record right the past 5 years track record right the past 5 years whether< whether the earnings and revenue is whether the earnings and revenue is growing< growing if it's growing then I think growing if it's growing then I think that< that will be considered a fundamentally that will be considered a fundamentally good< good stock candidate but of course you good stock candidate but of course you want< want to do your own dual dels okay so want to do your own dual dels okay so let's< let's get back to the stochastic let's get back to the stochastic oscillator< oscillator down here so if you want to oscillator down here so if you want to know< know the settings that I use I already know the settings that I use I already have< have a video video that I created all have a video video that I created all about< about it again just go to my channel and about it again just go to my channel and search< search for stochastic oscillator and in search for stochastic oscillator and in that< that video I'll just share with you all that video I'll just share with you all the< the settings that uh is displayed down the settings that uh is displayed down here< here so as you can see down here this is here so as you can see down here this is of< of Google and every time there is an of Google and every time there is an overso< overso reading it somehow coincides with overso reading it somehow coincides with the< the market going back up again right as the market going back up again right as you< you can see this is pretty much the you can see this is pretty much the turning< turning point right all four times turning point right all four times whenever< whenever the market or rather the whenever the market or rather the stochastic< stochastic o shows an overs reading the stochastic o shows an overs reading the market< market has bounced up so if you placed market has bounced up so if you placed the< the short putut spread in any of these the short putut spread in any of these times< times well there's going to be a great times well there's going to be a great likelihood< likelihood that you're going to be likelihood that you're going to be profitable< profitable now as you know it's not all profitable now as you know it's not all the< the time this oversold indicator is the time this oversold indicator is going< going to be a turning point for the going to be a turning point for the underlying< underlying that you're going to trade so underlying that you're going to trade so that< that is why we want to have an added that is why we want to have an added measure< measure to add the probability further measure to add the probability further in< in our favor and that is to identify the in our favor and that is to identify the support< support areas on the chart right so as support areas on the chart right so as you< you can see down here I've already drawn you can see down here I've already drawn a< a line over here so basically support a line over here so basically support areas< areas are just places where you see that areas are just places where you see that PR< PR price has difficulty going down right PR price has difficulty going down right as< as you can see down here price tried to as you can see down here price tried to go< go down it bounced back up tried to go go down it bounced back up tried to go down< down a few times and finally it come down a few times and finally it come back< back down again after going up to test back down again after going up to test this< this same support area again and this is this same support area again and this is a< a place where you know we can actually a place where you know we can actually consider< consider putting on a short put spread consider putting on a short put spread because< because right now not only do we already because right now not only do we already have< have a support area in place but we also have a support area in place but we also see< see that the stochastic has show an see that the stochastic has show an overso< overso reading so at this point in time overso reading so at this point in time we< we can actually place a put spread we can actually place a put spread and< and this is where you want to construct and this is where you want to construct your< your short putut spread below the your short putut spread below the support< support area so as you can see down here support area so as you can see down here this< this is the support and we basically this is the support and we basically just< just want to put it you know anywhere just want to put it you know anywhere below< below this support line down here so below this support line down here so where< where you actually want to place your where you actually want to place your this< this short put spread really depends on this short put spread really depends on how< how aggressive you are and also how how aggressive you are and also how bullish< bullish you are if you're extremely bullish you are if you're extremely bullish< bullish you might want to put your short bullish you might want to put your short putut< putut spread somewhere just below the putut spread somewhere just below the support< support and if you do it this way you're support and if you do it this way you're going< going to get more premiums right you're going to get more premiums right you're going< going to get higher premium but the going to get higher premium but the trade-off< trade-off is that you're going to get a trade-off is that you're going to get a lower< lower win rate in terms of probability lower win rate in terms of probability and< and it just makes sense right because and it just makes sense right because it's< it's just closer to the market but if it's just closer to the market but if you< you want to be a little bit more sure you want to be a little bit more sure you< you want to have a higher win rate you you want to have a higher win rate you want< want to play a little bit more safe then want to play a little bit more safe then you< you want to position your put spread you want to position your put spread slightly< slightly further away from where the slightly further away from where the current< current market price is and the tradeoff current market price is and the tradeoff is< is that you're just going to get lower is that you're just going to get lower premium< premium so at the end of the day there premium so at the end of the day there is< is no one best place to put the put is no one best place to put the put spread< spread it really comes down to you know spread it really comes down to you know your< your preference how you feel about the your preference how you feel about the underlying< underlying and also how defensive how underlying and also how defensive how safe< safe you want to play it all right so safe you want to play it all right so now< now that we've already talked about the now that we've already talked about the entries< entries let's talk about how are we entries let's talk about how are we going< going to exit the trade so to exit the going to exit the trade so to exit the trade< trade there are going to be a few trade there are going to be a few methods< methods now the very first method is to methods now the very first method is to use< use a fixed take profit right so for use a fixed take profit right so for example< example maybe you might want to choose a example maybe you might want to choose a 50%< 50% take profit Target which means to 50% take profit Target which means to say< say that you want to take profit at 50% say that you want to take profit at 50% of< of the credit that that you receive of the credit that that you receive right< right so let's say for example you right so let's say for example you receive< receive a credit of $2 if you receive a receive a credit of $2 if you receive a credit< credit of $2 for this trade then 50% credit of $2 for this trade then 50% just< just means it's $1 so if this uh trade just means it's $1 so if this uh trade down< down here drops to $1 in terms of the down here drops to $1 in terms of the credit< credit then this is where you can take credit then this is where you can take profit< profit and you make a dollar on this so profit and you make a dollar on this so that< that means to say you'll be making $100 that means to say you'll be making $100 on< on each put spread that you put on okay on each put spread that you put on okay so< so this is for method number one now so this is for method number one now method< method number two is to exit at 20 1 DTE method number two is to exit at 20 1 DTE so< so there are two reasons for this the so there are two reasons for this the very< very first reason is that based on very first reason is that based on performance-< performance- wise The Taste trade team performance- wise The Taste trade team already< already has done quite a lot of research already has done quite a lot of research on< on this and they found out that if you on this and they found out that if you would< would exit at 21 DTE the performance is would exit at 21 DTE the performance is going< going to be far superior than if you going to be far superior than if you were< were to actually exit at expiration and were to actually exit at expiration and the< the second and more important reason the second and more important reason that< that I think is very important for us is that I think is very important for us is that< that when you actually get past 21 DTE that when you actually get past 21 DTE that's< that's a time where it's going to be a that's a time where it's going to be a little< little bit more risky in terms of being little bit more risky in terms of being early< early assigned and this is specifically early assigned and this is specifically for< for if your trades are in the money for if your trades are in the money right< right so if your short putut spread is right so if your short putut spread is in< in the money and if you're going to hold in the money and if you're going to hold it< it past 21 DTE then this is where you it past 21 DTE then this is where you could< could get early assignment on this shot could get early assignment on this shot putut< putut down here and if you do get ass putut down here and if you do get ass sign< sign then you're going to be long 100 sign then you're going to be long 100 shares< shares and you could get into a margin shares and you could get into a margin call< call if you do not have enough capital call if you do not have enough capital in< in your account so to make it you know in your account so to make it you know very< very simple at the latest point right very simple at the latest point right get< get out at 21 DT DTE and Method number get out at 21 DT DTE and Method number three< three is the combo of number one and two three is the combo of number one and two well< well basically is that if at 21 DTE it well basically is that if at 21 DTE it doesn't< doesn't already reach the 50% take doesn't already reach the 50% take profit< profit or whatever take profit you set profit or whatever take profit you set at< at then you just exit the trade all at then you just exit the trade all right< right so this is the short put spread right so this is the short put spread and< and it's very important that you and it's very important that you understand< understand this because from here on the understand this because from here on the other< other two strategies that I'm going to other two strategies that I'm going to share< share with you are also going to involve share with you are also going to involve the< the shotput spread as one of the the shotput spread as one of the component< component and then we're going to manage component and then we're going to manage it< it also pretty much the same way so if it also pretty much the same way so if you< you understand this concept about the you understand this concept about the shut< shut spread what I've just shared with shut spread what I've just shared with you< you already then you're going to find it you already then you're going to find it very< very simple to construct the income very simple to construct the income strategy< strategy number two and number three strategy number two and

com SL blueprint all right back to the< the video so retirement income strategy the video so retirement income strategy number< number two is the J Condor so I've number two is the J Condor so I've touched< touched on this a little bit in quite a touched on this a little bit in quite a number< number of my other videos but for this number of my other videos but for this I'm< I'm going to share with you a very I'm going to share with you a very specific< specific way for you to trade where it's specific way for you to trade where it's just< just meant for you know a retirement just meant for you know a retirement style< style of trading so what exactly is the style of trading so what exactly is the jadeon< jadeon condo so as you can see down here jadeon condo so as you can see down here one< one of the components of the J iron one of the components of the J iron Condor< Condor is the short put spread right so Condor is the short put spread right so this< this is the same short put. spread which this is the same short put spread which I< I I shared with you in retirement income I I shared with you in retirement income strategy< strategy number one right you have this strategy number one right you have this short< short putut spread now for the jadeon short putut spread now for the jadeon Condor< Condor you have one additional strategy Condor you have one additional strategy that< that is added on to this short put that is added on to this short put spread< spread and that is the short call spread spread and that is the short call spread right< right the short call spread also known right the short call spread also known as< as the call Credit spread or the bare as the call Credit spread or the bare call< call spread basically you want to also call spread basically you want to also add< add this short call spread to further add this short call spread to further add< add more credit to the overall trade add more credit to the overall trade right< right so for example if you had maybe right so for example if you had maybe $1. 50< $1.

50 for this put spread if you were to $1. 50 for this put spread if you were to receive< receive maybe another 50 cents on this receive maybe another 50 cents on this overall< overall you're going to have more credit overall you're going to have more credit than< than if you were to just. trade the put than if you were to just trade the put spread< spread on your own right just the put spread on your own right just the put spread< spread by itself you're only going to spread by itself you're only going to receive< receive $1.

50 but with the call spread receive $1. 50 but with the call spread you< you add on to it you get another 50 you add on to it you get another 50 cents< cents you get a total of $2 right for cents you get a total of $2 right for this< this credit spread so your premium is this credit spread so your premium is going< going to be much more now how you're going to be much more now how you're going< going to construct this call spread is going to construct this call spread is going< going to be pretty unique because you going to be pretty unique because you want< want to have a certain width to this and want to have a certain width to this and basically< basically you want it to have a smaller basically you want it to have a smaller width< width than this short putut spread down width than this short putut spread down here< here the reason for this is because you here the reason for this is because you want< want the total credit right to be more want the total credit right to be more than< than the call spread with in order to than the call spread with in order to have< have no risk to the upside so the way we have no risk to the upside so the way we are< are constructing this J cond down here are constructing this J cond down here is< is whereby even if the market actually is whereby even if the market actually shoulds< shoulds pass the call spread there's shoulds pass the call spread there's still< still no risk to you right in fact it's still no risk to you right in fact it's still< still going to be a profit so this is still going to be a profit so this is slightly< slightly different from the traditional slightly different from the traditional iron< iron Condor right the traditional iron iron Condor right the traditional iron Condor< Condor if the market goes past the C Condor if the market goes past the C spread< spread you are going to lose money right spread you are going to lose money right but< but for this you're not going to lose but for this you're not going to lose money< money you're going to profit a little money you're going to profit a little bit< bit as well right although not as much bit as well right although not as much as< as if the market stays within this Zone as if the market stays within this Zone down< down here so you might be wondering down here so you might be wondering Davis< Davis why do you want to you know Davis why do you want to you know complicate< complicate things and add a call spread complicate things and add a call spread down< down here right why don't you just do down here right why don't you just do with< with this put spread down here and that with this put spread down here and that is< is good good question right and it's is good good question right and it's very< very valid that you can't just put on a very valid that you can't just put on a put< put spread for sure but you need to put spread for sure but you need to understand< understand is that when you at the call understand is that when you at the call spread< spread it becomes a not so bullish spread it becomes a not so bullish strategy< strategy because remember not all the strategy because remember not all the time< time the market will just keep going up time the market will just keep going up straight< straight so we may use the strategies straight so we may use the strategies that< that we have used earlier on to try and that we have used earlier on to try and Define< Define you know uh pinpoint where the Define you know uh pinpoint where the turning< turning point is but not all the time turning point is but not all the time the< the market is. going to keep going up the market is going to keep going up right< right there'll be times where the market right there'll be times where the market actually< actually just stays within this Zone actually just stays within this Zone down< down here right if it stays within this down here right if it stays within this Zone< Zone then guess what you are actually Zone then guess what you are actually going< going to profit more if you have this going to profit more if you have this call< call spread down here and this call call spread down here and this call spread< spread down here we're going to choose a spread down here we're going to choose a certain< certain Delta which I'm going to share certain Delta which I'm going to share with< with you later on whereby there's not with you later on whereby there's not going< going to be that much of a chance that going to be that much of a chance that the< the market is going to go above this the market is going to go above this point< point down here remember the Delta point down here remember the Delta already< already depicts what's the probability already depicts what's the probability that< that the you know Market will go past that the you know Market will go past that< that point this strike price at that point this strike price at expiration< expiration so if we were going to choose expiration so if we were going to choose a< a Delta whereby we know that it doesn't a Delta whereby we know that it doesn't go< go that often right in fact most of the go that often right in fact most of the time< time if it goes below this call spread time if it goes below this call spread then< then it does you good that you actually then it does you good that you actually add< add this call spread and add more credit add this call spread and add more credit and< and premium to the overall trade all and premium to the overall trade all right< right so the very key thing that you right so the very key thing that you need< need to understand while constructing need to understand while constructing this< this Jade condol is that the total this Jade condol is that the total credit< credit has to be more than the call credit has to be more than the call spread< spread withd so it basically just means spread withd so it basically just means this< this right it's going to be very simple this right it's going to be very simple if< if your call spread width is going to be if your call spread width is going to be $1< $1 you need to make sure that your total $1 you need to make sure that your total credit< credit right your total credit you're credit right your total credit you're going< going to receive is going to be more going to receive is going to be more than< than $1 why is that so because you need than $1 why is that so because you need to< to understand first of all that the max to understand first of all that the max risk< risk of your call Credit spread is risk of your call Credit spread is basically< basically the width of the spread if basically the width of the spread if it's< it's a $1 spread that just means is that it's a $1 spread that just means is that your< your max RIS is going to be $1 right or your max RIS is going to be $1 right or rather< rather uh per spread is going to be rather uh per spread is going to be $100< $100 so if you're going to have a credit $100 so if you're going to have a credit total< total credit that's going to be more total credit that's going to be more than< than a dollar let's say for example you than a dollar let's say for example you receive< receive $1.

50 to or maybe even $2 then receive $1. 50 to or maybe even $2 then you< you know that if the market goes all the you know that if the market goes all the way< way up you're going to lose $1 on this way up you're going to lose $1 on this but< but there still going to be a spillover but there still going to be a spillover the< the spillover is going to be somewhere the spillover is going to be somewhere from< from all right if we take 50 cents if we from all right if we take 50 cents if we take< take $150 C to $2 then it's going to be take $150 C to $2 then it's going to be anywhere< anywhere from 50 cents to $2 sorry to $1 anywhere from 50 cents to $2 sorry to $1 so< so in this case if the market goes up so in this case if the market goes up they< they still going to make profit but for they still going to make profit but for the< the most cases if the market stays the most cases if the market stays within< within this Zone down here then you're within this Zone down here then you're going< going to make a lot more now next what going to make a lot more now next what about< about the DTE selection so like I about the DTE selection so like I mentioned< mentioned before mentioned before once< once you really understood how we trade once you really understood how we trade the< the short put spread everything else the short put spread everything else becomes< becomes the same right pretty much the becomes the same right pretty much the same< same so for this the DTE selection again same so for this the DTE selection again we're< we're going to choose above 45 DTE we're going to choose above 45 DTE because< because that's where the positive Edge because that's where the positive Edge is< is going to be and as for the underlying is going to be and as for the underlying selection< selection same thing as well we're going selection same thing as well we're going to< to go for individual stocks and index to go for individual stocks and index ETFs< ETFs basically individual stocks what I ETFs basically individual stocks what I mean< mean is the fundamentally good stocks mean is the fundamentally good stocks fundamentally< fundamentally strong stocks and if fundamentally strong stocks and if you're< you're a beginner right just standing you're a beginner right just standing out< out then go with the index ETF because out then go with the index ETF because again< again less volatile and less a chance of again less volatile and less a chance of you< you know your put spread going in the you know your put spread going in the money< money okay so how do we enter into the money okay so how do we enter into the trade< trade so here's the beauty of this trade so here's the beauty of this strategies< strategies that I'm going to share with strategies that I'm going to share with you< you is that we're going to use a very you is that we're going to use a very common< common entry strategy to make everything common entry strategy to make everything similar< similar now so in this case similar to similar now so in this case similar to the< the shut spread we're going to use the the shut spread we're going to use the stochastic< stochastic oscillator or the RSI and we stochastic oscillator or the RSI and we are< are going to look for the oversold are going to look for the oversold reading< reading once we have identified the reading once we have identified the oversold< oversold reading then we want to oversold reading then we want to identify< identify the support areas on the chart identify the support areas on the chart and< and then now there are two parts to this and then now there are two parts to this so< so the short put spread same thing as so the short put spread same thing as the< the short put spread as you learn in the short put spread as you learn in retirement< retirement income strategy number one we retirement income strategy number one we want< want to place it below the support area want to place it below the support area all< all right then next you want to all right then next you want to constract< constract your short call spread so this constract your short call spread so this is< is where you want to place it anywhere is where you want to place it anywhere from< from 25 to 40 deltas and by that I mean from 25 to 40 deltas and by that I mean the< the short call right so the short call the short call right so the short call is< is going to be anywhere from 25 to 45 is going to be anywhere from 25 to 45 Deltas< Deltas so for example if you're a little Deltas so for example if you're a little bit< bit more bearish on the trade that you bit more bearish on the trade that you are< are not so certain that the market is are not so certain that the market is going< going to go all the way up you still going to go all the way up you still want< want to put on the trade then you can go want to put on the trade then you can go for< for a higher Delta 40 Deltas if you go for a higher Delta 40 Deltas if you go for< for 40 Deltas you're going to get even for 40 Deltas you're going to get even more< more credit on the trade at the same more credit on the trade at the same time< time construct it where the overall time construct it where the overall credit< credit is going to be greater than the credit is going to be greater than the call< call spread weave because this case if call spread weave because this case if. the< the market just goes up you are still the market just goes up you are still going< going to be in profit now if you want a going to be in profit now if you want a wider< wider Max profit Zone then you can go wider Max profit Zone then you can go for< for the 25 Delta so this is where you for the 25 Delta so this is where you really< really want to just play around with the really want to just play around with the strikes< strikes and see what kind of credit you strikes and see what kind of credit you can< can get all right so next we are going can get all right so next we are going to< to talk about how to exit the trade so to talk about how to exit the trade so again< again it's going to be very similar to again it's going to be very similar to the< the short putut spread so you're going the short putut spread so you're going to< to have a fixed takeprofit so maybe it's to have a fixed takeprofit so maybe it's going< going to be 50% or 40% or uh however going to be 50% or 40% or uh however much< much you want it to be and Method number much you want it to be and Method number two< two exit at 21 DTE and again I've two exit at 21 DTE and again I've already< already explained the reason why and already explained the reason why and finally< finally method number three is the combo finally method number three is the combo of< of methods one and two now the only main of methods one and two now the only main difference< difference that you need to also you difference that you need to also you know< know think about is if your call spread know think about is if your call spread goes< goes in the money now when your call goes in the money now when your call spread< spread goes in the money that is not spread goes in the money that is not going< going to have any loss right if you going to have any loss right if you construct< construct it properly if you construct construct it properly if you construct it< it the right way whereby the total it the right way whereby the total credit< credit is more than the uh call spread credit is more than the uh call spread withd< withd you're going to be in a profit withd you're going to be in a profit however< however you need to understand right now however you need to understand right now is< is that your uh call option down here is that your uh call option down here your< your short call is going to be in the your short call is going to be in the money< money and this is where you know you money and this is where you know you could< could get in into an early assignment if could get in into an early assignment if you< you get into a point whereby the extr you get into a point whereby the extr value< value is very little so that is why value is very little so that is why again< again it's very important that you do again it's very important that you do not< not exit you know the trade past 21 DTE not exit you know the trade past 21 DTE because< because at that point that's when the because at that point that's when the exensive< exensive value is going to really drop exensive value is going to really drop and< and the chances of you getting assigned and the chances of you getting assigned on< on this call option is going to be on this call option is going to be higher< higher right if you're going to get higher right if you're going to get assigned< assigned on your call option you're assigned on your call option you're going< going to be short a 100 shares right so going to be short a 100 shares right so same< same thing if you don't have the uh same thing if you don't have the uh capital< capital or the funds in your account capital or the funds in your account you're< you're going to get a margin call all you're going to get a margin call all right< right all right so this is retirement right all right so this is retirement income< income strategy number two and let's now income strategy number two and let's now get< get into the final income strategy get into the final income strategy number< number three and that is the put broken number three and that is the put broken wing< wing butterfly so what is the put broken wing butterfly so what is the put broken wing< wing butterfly so again as you can see wing butterfly so again as you can see down< down here one of the core components of down here one of the core components of the< the put broking butterfly is the short the put broking butterfly is the short put< put spread it's the same short putut put spread it's the same short putut spread< spread that we use in income strategy spread that we use in income strategy number< number one and number two now the number one and number two now the difference< difference is that this time we're going difference is that this time we're going to< to use the short put spread to finance to use the short put spread to finance the< the second strategy that we're going to the second strategy that we're going to put< put on and that is the long put spread put on and that is the long put spread right< right so we are going to use the credit right so we are going to use the credit which< which we receive from the short putut which we receive from the short putut spread< spread so let's say for example maybe we spread so let's say for example maybe we receive< receive $1.

50 for this if we're going to receive $1. 50 for this if we're going to receive< receive a150 for this we want to use a receive a150 for this we want to use a part< part of it to purchase this long putut part of it to purchase this long putut spread< spread so maybe we are going to use a spread so maybe we are going to use a dollar< dollar right so if let's say for example dollar right so if let's say for example we< we use a dollar we're still going to get we use a dollar we're still going to get an< an overall profit of about 50 cents so an overall profit of about 50 cents so that< that means to say if the market goes all that means to say if the market goes all the< the way up we are still going to be in the way up we are still going to be in profit< profit now this lput spread down here profit now this lput spread down here they< they are going to share the same short they are going to share the same short put< put strike as the short putut spread put strike as the short putut spread above< above so that's why you notice down here above so that's why you notice down here there< there is two puts down here instead of there is two puts down here instead of one< one that is because right now you are one that is because right now you are pretty< pretty much sharing the same put strike pretty much sharing the same put strike as< as the short put spread so why do you as the short put spread so why do you want< want to use the put brokering butterfly want to use the put brokering butterfly over< over the short putut spread or maybe the over the short putut spread or maybe the J< J condo so here's the main difference J condo so here's the main difference between< between the three strategies the put between the three strategies the put spread< spread the pure vanilla short put spread spread the pure vanilla short put spread is< is the most bullish of all three is the most bullish of all three strategies< strategies if you think the market is strategies if you think the market is going< going to move up very quickly right going to move up very quickly right after< after you put on the trade then you want after you put on the trade then you want to< to put on the short put spread now if to put on the short put spread now if you're< you're not too sure whether it's really you're not too sure whether it's really going< going to go up you think it might going to go up you think it might probably< probably go sideways then you would want probably go sideways then you would want to< to put the J in condo now what if at the to put the J in condo now what if at the point< point you are still not too sure right point you are still not too sure right maybe< maybe you are slightly more uh neutral maybe you are slightly more uh neutral to< to a little bit bearish but you still to a little bit bearish but you still hope< hope that the market overall goes up hope that the market overall goes up then< then this is where you put a put broking then this is where you put a put broking butterfly< butterfly because the p broking butterfly because the p broking butterfly< butterfly has the lowest Break Even butterfly has the lowest Break Even point< point of all the three strategies that point of all the three strategies that I've< I've shared that means to say that the I've shared that means to say that the chances< chances of you losing this trade is not chances of you losing this trade is not as< as high as the other two in short it has as high as the other two in short it has the< the highest win rate right so he has the the highest win rate right so he has the highest< highest win rate the other thing is also highest win rate the other thing is also is< is that if the market goes up then is that if the market goes up then you're< you're not going to make as much as the you're not going to make as much as the short< short put spread or the jiton Condor the short put spread or the jiton Condor the only< only time the put broken wi butterfly is only time the put broken wi butterfly is going< going to really make a lot of money is going to really make a lot of money is if< if it comes down to this point down here if it comes down to this point down here basically< basically where your short put strike is basically where your short put strike is where< where you want the market to be to make where you want the market to be to make the< the most money is where your shut strike the most money is where your shut strike is< is what about the DTE selection so again is what about the DTE selection so again like< like I mentioned the beauty of the like I mentioned the beauty of the strategies< strategies I shared with you here that strategies I shared with you here that is< is that they all share pretty much the is that they all share pretty much the same< same mechanics right so DTE selection same mechanics right so DTE selection same< same thing we go for above 45 DTE as for same thing we go for above 45 DTE as for underlying< underlying selection same thing we go underlying selection same thing we go for< for uh fundamentally good stocks index for uh fundamentally good stocks index ETFs< ETFs and this time with an added one ETFs and this time with an added one which< which is the cash settled index options which is the cash settled index options right< right for example XSP SPX so on and so right for example XSP SPX so on and so forth< forth so for beginners the safest is to forth so for beginners the safest is to go< go for the index ETFs and the cash setup go for the index ETFs and the cash setup index< index options uh because they do not index options uh because they do not really< really move that much and also with the really move that much and also with the cash< cash setup index options you do not get cash setup index options you do not get early< early assignment which means say you can early assignment which means say you can actually< actually hold this trade to expiration actually hold this trade to expiration so< so how do you enter into a trade for the so how do you enter into a trade for the put< put broking butterfly so as you can see put broking butterfly so as you can see down< down here it's pretty much the same down here it's pretty much the same thing< thing so similar to the short spread thing so similar to the short spread we're< we're going to use the stochastic we're going to use the stochastic oscillator< oscillator or the RSI and we're looking oscillator or the RSI and we're looking for< for the overso reading identify the for the overso reading identify the support< support area and then this time you want support area and then this time you want to< to construct your put broking butterfly to construct your put broking butterfly below< below the support area so remember the P below the support area so remember the P broking< broking butterfly similar to all the broking butterfly similar to all the other< other strategies that we have uh shared other strategies that we have uh shared so< so far is that there is no risk to the so far is that there is no risk to the upside< upside so same thing as this put program upside so same thing as this put program butterfly< butterfly there is no risk to the upside butterfly there is no risk to the upside it's< it's just that you do not make that much it's just that you do not make that much so< so for this strategy you actually do so for this strategy you actually do want< want the market to come down and want the market to come down and hopefully< hopefully it stays there for as long as hopefully it stays there for as long as possible< possible for your profit to slowly possible for your profit to slowly increase< increase over. time now how do we exit increase over time now how do we exit the< the put brokering butterfly so for the the put brokering butterfly so for the put< put brokering butterfly is going to be put brokering butterfly is going to be slight< slight difference compared to the first slight difference compared to the first two< two strategies that I share with you so two strategies that I share with you so the< the very first method there's also a the very first method there's also a fixed< fixed take profit but this time we want fixed take profit but this time we want to< to have a much smaller takeprofit and to have a much smaller takeprofit and when< when I talk about the take profit is of when I talk about the take profit is of the< the max profit so when we were talking the max profit so when we were talking about< about the take profit for income about the take profit for income strategy< strategy one and two we were actually strategy one and two we were actually talking< talking about a percentage of the credit talking about a percentage of the credit that< that we receive right but for this we that we receive right but for this we actually< actually want to take the percentage actually want to take the percentage based< based of the max profit right because based of the max profit right because the< the credit that you receive is different the credit that you receive is different from< from the max profit potential of this from the max profit potential of this strategy< strategy so what I'm going to do is that strategy so what I'm going to do is that I'm< I'm going to very quickly just draw the I'm going to very quickly just draw the p&amp;l< p&amp;l graph of how the uh put broken wing p&amp;l graph of how the uh put broken wing butterfly< butterfly actually looks like so you can butterfly actually looks like so you can have< have a visual representation of this so have a visual representation of this so basically< basically this is the put broken wing basically this is the put broken wing butterfly< butterfly the p&amp;l graph how it looks butterfly the p&amp;l graph how it looks like< like this is the Z line basically like this is the Z line basically anything< anything above this will be in a profit anything above this will be in a profit below< below this is a loss and below here is below this is a loss and below here is basically< basically the price chart right the basically the price chart right the price< price so that means to say if the market price so that means to say if the market was< was to go up it will be going to the was to go up it will be going to the right< right hand side if the price of the right hand side if the price of the market< market goes down so in this case if it market goes down so in this case if it goes< goes down here it will be on the left goes down here it will be on the left hand< hand side right so as you can see down hand side right so as you can see down here< here this is where the break even line here this is where the break even line is< is and if the market actually goes up is and if the market actually goes up all< all right you can see down here this is all right you can see down here this is actually< actually where it makes the least in actually where it makes the least in terms< terms of the max profit so over here terms of the max profit so over here this< this is actually the credit that you this is actually the credit that you receive< receive up front right up front down receive up front right up front down here< here this is the credit but then your here this is the credit but then your max< max profit is down here so when I talk max profit is down here so when I talk about< about the 15% about the 15% 25%< 25% of the max profit actually mean of 25% of the max profit actually mean of this< this point down here so this is where this point down here so this is where you< you need to go to your p&amp;l graph to take you need to go to your p&amp;l graph to take a< a look at what is the max profit okay so a look at what is the max profit okay so this< this is the very first method now method this is the very first method now method number< number two same thing is to exit at 21 number two same thing is to exit at 21 DTE< DTE although if you exit at 21 DTE your DTE although if you exit at 21 DTE your profit< profit may not be that high it's very profit may not be that high it's very hard< hard for you to reach the maximum profit hard for you to reach the maximum profit of< of the put brokering butterfly basically of the put brokering butterfly basically because< because it's a slow spread which means because it's a slow spread which means it< it takes a long time for you to realize it takes a long time for you to realize the< the max profit if the market actually the max profit if the market actually comes< comes down to where the tent of your put comes down to where the tent of your put broken< broken wing butterfly is now method broken wing butterfly is now method number< number three is a combo of method one number three is a combo of method one and< and two like I mentioned or method and two like I mentioned or method number< number four is to just hold it all the number four is to just hold it all the way< way to expiration and you can only do way to expiration and you can only do this< this on cash settle index options so this on cash settle index options so this< this way if you do it on a cash settle this way if you do it on a cash settle index< index options and you hold it to index options and you hold it to expiration< expiration number one you're not going expiration number one you're not going to< to have any early assignment there's no to have any early assignment there's no assignment< assignment of shares as well and there's assignment of shares as well and there's also< also the potential profit of the Max also the potential profit of the Max profit< profit if actually comes down to the 10 profit if actually comes down to the 10 at< at the same time your max loss has at the same time your max loss has already< already been kept as well so you do not already been kept as well so you do not have< have to worry about the max loss because have to worry about the max loss because you< you should already have the max risk of you should already have the max risk of this< this trade as a small percentage of your this trade as a small percentage of your overall< overall account all right so these are overall account all right so these are the< the three retirement income strategies the three retirement income strategies so< so let me know in the comments below so let me know in the comments below which< which of these three you think is the which of these three you think is the most< most suitable for you by the way if you most suitable for you by the way if you like< like this video then you're absolutely like this video then you're absolutely going< going to love this next video which I going to love this next video which I have<

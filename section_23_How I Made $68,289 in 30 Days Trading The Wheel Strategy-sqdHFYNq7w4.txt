========================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to share with you how I made I'm going to share with you how I made over over over $68,000< $68,000 trading the wheels strategy so $68,000 trading the wheels strategy so as< as you can see over here uh this is one as you can see over here uh this is one of< of my trading accounts so this is with of my trading accounts so this is with interactive< interactive brokers so for this account interactive brokers so for this account I< I only mainly trade the wheel strategy I only mainly trade the wheel strategy so< so the gains that you see here is only so the. gains that you see here is only on< on the wheel strategy so as you can see on the wheel strategy so as you can see for< for this month which is the month of for this month which is the month of December< December so you can see it's 31st December so you can see it's 31st December< December 2024 December 2024 the< the gains which I have is $ the gains which I have is $ 68,276 68,276 68,276 so< so if I was to take a look at the so if I was to take a look at the performance< performance well you can see that for performance well you can see that for this< this month alone the return is about this month alone the return is about 8. 64%< 8.

64% which is actually not too bad 8. 64% which is actually not too bad because< because if I was to Benchmark this because if I was to Benchmark this against< against the other indices for example against the other indices for example the< the S&amp;P 500 you will see that the the S&amp;P 500 you will see that. the performance< performance is actually much better than performance is actually much better than some< some of the indices there so for example some of the indices there so for example S&amp;P< S&amp;P 500 for the month of December is S&amp;P 500 for the month of December is actually< actually down 2.

08% but my portfolio is actually down 2. 08% but my portfolio is not< not only up. but it's up not only up but it's up 8.

64%< 8. 64% now what about if I Benchmark this 8.

64% now what about if I Benchmark this to< to the NES deck so as you can see for to the NES deck so as you can see for the< the. NES deck NES deck is positive for the NES deck NES deck is positive for the< the month but it's only positive by the month but it's only positive by 1. 47%< 1.

47% so it's still slightly lesser than 1. 47% so it's still slightly lesser than my< my portfolio and if I was to compare my portfolio and if I was to compare this< this against the Russo 2000 then you this against the Russo 2000 then you will< will see that the performance of my real. will see that the performance of my real strategy< strategy portfolio pretty much over strategy portfolio pretty much over shadowed< shadowed the performance of Russell 2000 shadowed the performance of Russell 2000 because< because the Russell had a return of because the Russell had a return of 8.

4%< 8. 4% for the month so if I was to 8.

4% for the month so if I was to compare< compare this with the three indices then compare this with the three indices then my< my portfolio is actually doing not so my portfolio is actually doing not so bad< bad so how is it that I can get this bad so how is it that I can get this kind< kind of return for the month of December kind of return for the month of December when< when most of the indices are either when most of the indices are either negative< negative or didn't really make much and negative or didn't really make much and the< the reason is because I focus on one the reason is because I focus on one aspect< aspect of the wheel strategy that not aspect of the wheel strategy that not too< too many people actually Focus on so the too many people actually Focus on so the very< very first thing I like to look up for very first thing I like to look up for when< when I start trading the wheel strategy when I start trading the wheel strategy is< is basically companies that are is basically companies that are fundamentally< fundamentally strong I do not want to fundamentally strong I do not want to just< just trade stocks that has high just trade stocks that has high volatility< volatility because a lot of people tend volatility because a lot of people tend to< to do that they want to find the stocks to do that they want to find the stocks that< that has very high volatility so they that has very high volatility so they get< get very high premium but what they get very high premium but what they don't< don't realize is that if it has a very don't realize is that if it has a very high< high volatility it also means that it high volatility it also means that it could< could have very very wild swings in the could have very very wild swings in the underlying< underlying stock price price movement underlying stock price price movement and< and this not something that I really and this not something that I really like< like I prefer something that's much more like I prefer something that's much more predictable< predictable basically I want the predictable basically I want the underlying< underlying to be appreciating over the underlying to be appreciating over the long< long term that means if the price is long term that means if the price is going< going to go up then I know that the going to go up then I know that the wheel< wheel strategy has a better chance to wheel strategy has a better chance to work< work out so that's the first thing I work out so that's the first thing I look< look out for so how do you tell whether look out for so how do you tell whether a< a company is fundamentally strong so a company is fundamentally strong so there< there are quite a number of criterias there are quite a number of criterias but< but for me a very quick snapshot one of but for me a very quick snapshot one of the< the ways that I like to you know just the ways that I like to you know just have< have an idea whether the company is good have an idea whether the company is good before< before I start to really dive into the before I start to really dive into the fundamentals< fundamentals is to take a look at this fundamentals is to take a look at this uh< uh Google Finance type in the company uh Google Finance type in the company right< right so in this case I have Nvidia and right so in this case I have Nvidia and then< then what I like to do is just go down then what I like to do is just go down to< to the income statement so for me what I to the income statement so for me what I really< really want to look up for is that there really want to look up for is that there is< is increasing Revenue year on year as is increasing Revenue year on year as well< well as increasing net income or profit well as increasing net income or profit so< so in this case mvidia you know pretty so in this case mvidia you know pretty consistent< consistent although in 2023 there's a consistent although in 2023 there's a slight< slight dip but in 2024 it did pretty slight dip but in 2024 it did pretty well< well so Nvidia is one of those companies well so Nvidia is one of those companies I< I do think is uh pretty fundamentally I do think is uh pretty fundamentally sound< sound but of course definitely do your sound but of course definitely do your own< own due diligence I'm not telling you to own due diligence I'm not telling you to get< get into Nvidia especially if you were get into Nvidia especially if you were to< to get into this stock you also need to to get into this stock you also need to know< know when to get into it for the wheel know when to get into it for the wheel strategy< strategy so once you've already decided strategy so once you've already decided on< on the stocks that you want to do for on the stocks that you want to do for the< the wheel strategy what's the next thing the wheel strategy what's the next thing you< you got to do so the main idea for me you got to do so the main idea for me when< when I'm training the wheel strategy is when I'm training the wheel strategy is I< I want to find out what is the rough I want to find out what is the rough valuation< valuation of the stock so for example valuation of the stock so for example I'm< I'm going to put the valuation line down I'm going to put the valuation line down here< here I'm going to put for V what I'm here I'm going to put for V what I'm ideally< ideally trying. to do with the wi ideally trying to do with the wi strategy< strategy is I want to sell a cash secure strategy is I want to sell a cash secure put< put that is below the valuation and put that is below the valuation and ideally< ideally once the market goes back up ideally once the market goes back up above< above the valuation I want to sell the above the valuation I want to sell the covered< covered call so this way I'm actually covered call so this way I'm actually getting< getting three forms of profits so to getting three forms of profits so to speak< speak so the very first one is in terms speak so the very first one is in terms of< of selling the cash account premium of selling the cash account premium second< second one is selling the cover call and second one is selling the cover call and the< the thir third one which is what a lot the thir third one which is what a lot of< of people actually do not really focus of people actually do not really focus on< on is actually the capital gains so on is actually the capital gains so capital< capital gains is when you sell the cash capital gains is when you sell the cash output< output over here and you're assigned the output over here and you're assigned the 100< 100 shares this is where if you hold on 100 shares this is where if you hold on to< to the stock to the point whereby it to the stock to the point whereby it goes< goes up and then you sell the cover call goes up and then you sell the cover call and< and then it gets assigned at your cover and then it gets assigned at your cover call< call over here and then this is where call over here and then this is where you< you get called away you actually get the you get called away you actually get the profit< profit from here to here so this profit from here to here so this actually< actually makes a very big chunk of the actually makes a very big chunk of the profits< profits in your wheel strategy a lot of profits in your wheel strategy a lot of people< people just try and get the premium and people just try and get the premium and I< I feel that's a little bit shortsighted I feel that's a little bit shortsighted because< because if you only get the premium because if you only get the premium where< where you only want to get very high where you only want to get very high premium< premium through those High volatility premium through those High volatility stocks< stocks sooner or later it can get into stocks sooner or later it can get into trouble< trouble whereby you get into one of trouble whereby you get into one of those< those stocks where the market really those stocks where the market really crashes< crashes or rather the stock crashes and crashes or rather the stock crashes and then< then you're stuck at a position where then you're stuck at a position where it's< it's very hard for the market to it's very hard for the market to eventually< eventually go back up for you to break eventually go back up for you to break even< even or sell a covered call at so that's even or sell a covered call at so that's one< one thing that I look at so the question one thing that I look at so the question is< is how do you find out what is the is how do you find out what is the valuation< valuation of the stock so luckily for us valuation of the stock so luckily for us there< there are already websites out there there are already websites out there that< that actually does the calculation for that actually does the calculation for us< us now if you want to get very specific us now if you want to get very specific and< and you want to do your own calculations and you want to do your own calculations you< you can do that but I prefer to just you can do that but I prefer to just rely< rely on a lot of the sites out there rely on a lot of the sites out there that< that really would show us what's the that really would show us what's the valuation< valuation so for example one of the valuation so for example one of the sites< sites that you can use is what's called sites that you can use is what's called simply< simply Wall Street so simply Wall Street simply Wall Street so simply Wall Street basically< basically just tells you you know the basically just tells you you know the company< company you know it goes into all this company you know it goes into all this uh< uh details which you can look at as well uh details which you can look at as well it< it tells you the valuation the future it tells you the valuation the future growth< growth past performance Financial Health growth past performance Financial Health so< so on and so forth so you can see all so on and so forth so you can see all this< this on your own so if I was to go over this on your own so if I was to go over to< to the valuation over here you can see to the valuation over here you can see that< that right now it's saying that Nvidia that right now it's saying that Nvidia is< is overpriced so although Nvidia is a is overpriced so although Nvidia is a fundamentally< fundamentally good stock in my opinion I fundamentally good stock in my opinion I wouldn't< wouldn't want to get into the wheel wouldn't want to get into the wheel strategy< strategy for NVIDIA right now because strategy for NVIDIA right now because the< the current price is just overvalued the current price is just overvalued right< right as you can see over here it's right as you can see over here it's currently currently currently 35. 5%< 35.

5% overvalued so this is not where I 35. 5% overvalued so this is not where I want< want to enter into the stock for the want to enter into the stock for the wheel< wheel strategy I want to wait for the wheel strategy I want to wait for the price< price to drop below this fair value then price to drop below this fair value then I< I will start selling the cash output and I will start selling the cash output and then< then get into the whole wheel strategy then get into the whole wheel strategy so< so this is how I find the fair value now so this is how I find the fair value now this< this is not the only website that shows this is not the only website that shows the< the fair value of the stock you actually the fair value of the stock you actually can< can go to other sites for example Guru can go to other sites for example Guru focus< focus is another one of them and you focus is another one of them and you also< also have Morning Star now what if all also have Morning Star now what if all the< the different sites that you're looking the different sites that you're looking at< at all give different valuations so for at all give different valuations so for myself< myself personally I like to be a little myself personally I like to be a little bit< bit more conservative I like to play it bit more conservative I like to play it on< on the safe side what I like to do is I on the safe side what I like to do is I would< would just go and find the lowest would just go and find the lowest valuation< valuation and then go with that one valuation and then go with that one because< because I want to air on the safe side because I want to air on the safe side so< so if this site for example Morning Star so if this site for example Morning Star is< is telling me that Nvidia is is let's is telling me that Nvidia is is let's say< say $120 for the fair value but on say $120 for the fair value but on simply< simply Wall Street it's telling me that simply Wall Street it's telling me that it's it's it's $101< $101 then I am going to use this value $101 then I am going to use this value of< of $101 and only wait until Nvidia drops of $101 and only wait until Nvidia drops below< below $101 before I start selling the below $101 before I start selling the cash< cash secure output so now that I know cash secure output so now that I know what< what is the fair value the next thing I what is the fair value the next thing I want< want to do is I will go over to the want to do is I will go over to the chart< chart and then I'll just simply draw a chart and then I'll just simply draw a line< line to show me where is the current line to show me where is the current fair< fair value so as you can see over here fair value so as you can see over here this< this is NVIDIA and I've already drawn this is NVIDIA and I've already drawn this< this horizontal line over here where you this horizontal line over here where you can< can go to the left hand side uh this is can go to the left hand side uh this is trading< trading view by the way all you got to trading view by the way all you got to do< do is just click this and then you can do is just click this and then you can plot< plot this horizontal line to show where. plot this horizontal line to show where the< the fair value is so as you can see the fair value is so as you can see right< right now Nvidia is currently Above This right now Nvidia is currently Above This fair< fair value so I'm definitely not looking fair value so I'm definitely not looking to< to get into the wheel strategy now I to get into the wheel strategy now I want< want to wait until the price actually want to wait until the price actually goes< goes below this fair value line then I'm goes below this fair value line then I'm going< going to start to sell the cash secure going to start to sell the cash secure put< put and let's say I'm not being assigned put and let's say I'm not being assigned on< on the cash sec put let's say it expires on the cash sec put let's say it expires worthless< worthless then I'm just going to sell worthless then I'm just going to sell the< the cash output again and once I'm the cash output again and once I'm assigned< assigned then I'm going to wait until assigned then I'm going to wait until the< the price actually goes above this fair the price actually goes above this fair value< value then I start selling this covered value then I start selling this covered call< call so for me this is a very big part call so for me this is a very big part of< of the wheel strategy where I actually of the wheel strategy where I actually hold< hold on to the stocks and wait for it to hold on to the stocks and wait for it to go< go up to a certain amount first so in go up to a certain amount first so in this< this case as you can see above the this case as you can see above the valuation< valuation line then I sell the cover valuation line then I sell the cover call< call because when you sell the cash call because when you sell the cash secure< secure put as well as the cover call the secure put as well as the cover call the premiums< premiums is really not a lot it's not premiums is really not a lot it's not really< really going to make a huge difference really going to make a huge difference for< for me the main profit driver really is for me the main profit driver really is the< the capital gains down here so at this the capital gains down here so at this point< point of time you might be asking but point of time you might be asking but Davis< Davis if you think that it's going to go Davis if you think that it's going to go up< up why don't you just buy the stock out up why don't you just buy the stock out right< right by the way if you like this

com blueprint all right back to the< the video well the thing is that you the video well the thing is that you never< never know what's going to happen what never know what's going to happen what if< if the moment the market comes down to if the moment the market comes down to this< this point down here and I sell the cash this point down here and I sell the cash cut< cut putut the market continues going cut putut the market continues going further< further down so if I had not sold this further down so if I had not sold this cashup< cashup putut I wouldn't have this cashup putut I wouldn't have this premium< premium I wouldn't be able to get this premium I wouldn't be able to get this income< income so to speak and I would just be income so to speak and I would just be holding< holding on to the stock but with this holding on to the stock but with this cash< cash C put down here at least I'm able cash C put down here at least I'm able to< to get some premium and not all the time to get some premium and not all the time I< I could get a sign so the market could I could get a sign so the market could come< come down here and it just stalls for a come down here and it just stalls for a while< while and I would have already gotten while and I would have already gotten this< this uh premium from this cash output it this uh premium from this cash output it expires< expires then I sell another one again so expires then I sell another one again so I< I can keep selling it and keep getting I can keep selling it and keep getting this< this premium at the same time I also use this premium at the same time I also use What's< What's called the income grid wheel What's called the income grid wheel strategy< strategy so if you're not familiar with strategy so if you're not familiar with this< this term this is a strategy that I this term this is a strategy that I pretty< pretty much use you can just go to my pretty much use you can just go to my channel< channel and type the term income grid channel and type the term income grid wheel< wheel strategy and it will explain to wheel strategy and it will explain to you< you what it means I have a number of you what it means I have a number of videos< videos on that so basically is that I videos on that so basically is that I don't< don't just sell one cash secure output I don't just sell one cash secure output I sell< sell them in a number of trenches so of sell them in a number of trenches so of course< course you need to have your risk course you need to have your risk properly< properly planned out for this in order properly planned out for this in order to< to do this properly but if you only have to do this properly but if you only have uh< uh small capital or rather you don't uh small capital or rather you don't have< have that big of a capital to do many have that big of a capital to do many Cash< Cash Out puts along the way then doing Cash Out puts along the way then doing this< this just one level is more than enough this just one level is more than enough so< so that's why for me the important Point so that's why for me the important Point really< really is to capture the capital gains really is to capture the capital gains because< because if you were to take a look at because if you were to take a look at the< the premiums alone just by selling the the premiums alone just by selling the cash< cash output and the cover cost is really cash output and the cover cost is really not< not that much so if I was to go over to not that much so if I was to go over to the< the option chain right now so let me the option chain right now so let me just< just go over to the option chain here on just go over to the option chain here on my< my account here for tasty trade so let my account here for tasty trade so let me< me just go to Nvidia here all right type me just go to Nvidia here all right type Nvidia< Nvidia go to trade and let's just say uh Nvidia go to trade and let's just say uh you< you go to the let's say the 7 17 days by you go to the let's say the 7 17 days by the< the way for me for the cash secure the way for me for the cash secure output< output and the cover calls when I trade output and the cover calls when I trade a< a wheel strategy I like to go for a a wheel strategy I like to go for a shorter< shorter term so if you've been a shorter term so if you've been a follower< follower of my channel for quite some follower of my channel for quite some time< time you'll know that my default ones time you'll know that my default ones usually< usually is around 45 DTE but that is usually is around 45 DTE but that is only< only if I trade the strategies where I only if I trade the strategies where I do< do not want to get assigned so if I do do not want to get assigned so if I do not< not want to get assigned I will go for not want to get assigned I will go for the< the slightly longer term DTE but for the the slightly longer term DTE but for the wheel< wheel strategy I actually want to get wheel strategy I actually want to get ass< ass signed or rather I don't mind ass signed or rather I don't mind getting< getting a signed so this is where I will getting a signed so this is where I will go< go for the shorter term DTE so I may go go for the shorter term DTE so I may go anywhere< anywhere up to about 30 days so let's anywhere up to about 30 days so let's say< say for example if I go for somewhere say for example if I go for somewhere around< around the 17 days so this is slightly around the 17 days so this is slightly above< above two weeks and for the Delta I like above two weeks and for the Delta I like to< to go somewhere near at the money not to go somewhere near at the money not necessarily< necessarily right at the money but necessarily right at the money but somewhere< somewhere out of the money around here somewhere out of the money around here so< so somewhere around 40 Deltas would be so somewhere around 40 Deltas would be good< good as well so if I was to choose this good as well so if I was to choose this 135< 135 strike down here you can see it's 135 strike down here you can see it's only< only giving me a mid price of $442 which only giving me a mid price of $442 which is< is only about is only about $412< $412 which is not that much because your $412 which is not that much because your Capital< Capital outlay will be about Capital outlay will be about $13,500< $13,500 because if you're trading the $13,500 because if you're trading the wheel< wheel strategy it means you're already wheel strategy it means you're already prepared< prepared to get a sign so you definitely prepared to get a sign so you definitely need< need to have the cash of this need to have the cash of this $13,500< $13,500 in case the market goes down $13,500 in case the market goes down stays< stays below the strike price and stays below the strike price and expiration< expiration and you get a sign so you're expiration and you get a sign so you're getting< getting only about getting only about $412< $412 for a capital outlay of$ 13,500 $412 for a capital outlay of$ 13,500 that's< that's not a lot you a big screen of that's not a lot you a big screen of things< things because you have a lot of capital things because you have a lot of capital that< that you're being put down for this that you're being put down for this position< position down here so that is why if you position down here so that is why if you want< want to have bigger profits when it want to have bigger profits when it comes< comes to the wheel strategy then you comes to the wheel strategy then you want< want to also aim for the capital gains want to also aim for the capital gains let's< let's say for example if you sold it at let's say for example if you sold it at 135< 135 and let's say you got ass signed 135 and let's say you got ass signed then< then you got the premium of then you got the premium of $42< $42 but let's say the market actually $42 but let's say the market actually goes< goes up or rather Nvidia goes up and goes up or rather Nvidia goes up and it's< it's above the valuation and let's just it's above the valuation and let's just say< say the valuation let's say it's 145 and say the valuation let's say it's 145 and once< once it goes above 145 you sold it at 1 once it goes above 145 you sold it at 1 15< 15 the cover call so when you sell the 15 the cover call so when you sell the cover< cover call you're going to get some cover call you're going to get some premium< premium again so in this case if you premium again so in this case if you were< were to hold from 135 and you exit were to hold from 135 and you exit somewhere< somewhere around 1 15 you would have somewhere around 1 15 you would have made< made $15 in terms of the capital gains made $15 in terms of the capital gains per< per share so each option controls 100 per share so each option controls 100 shares< shares so $15 time 100 you get 1,500 shares so $15 time 100 you get 1,500 which< which is 1,5 $0000 for impr profit if which is 1,5 $0000 for impr profit if you< you were to hold it in terms of capital you were to hold it in terms of capital gains< gains and that can significantly boost gains and that can significantly boost your< your profits for the wheel strategy so your profits for the wheel strategy so this< this is generally how I like to trade this is generally how I like to trade the< the wheel strategy sell your cash secure the wheel strategy sell your cash secure put< put below the valuation line and once put below the valuation line and once it's< it's assigned you wait until the stock it's assigned you wait until the stock goes< goes back up and then you sell the cover goes back up and then you sell the cover call< call above the valuation line now what call above the valuation line now what if< if you're looking at stocks whereby the if you're looking at stocks whereby the valuation< valuation is way above where the current valuation is way above where the current price< price is so for example let's take a price is so for example let's take a look< look at alphabet so alphabet if I was to look at alphabet so alphabet if I was to go< go over to the valuation you can see go over to the valuation you can see over< over here the current price is over here the current price is $191< $191 but the fair value is $191 but the fair value is $241< $241 74 so it's really way up there and $241 74 so it's really way up there and if< if I was to go over to the Chart so let if I was to go over to the Chart so let me< me just go over to Google. down here so me just go over to Google down here so let< let me just remove this drawings as well let me just remove this drawings as well as< as you can see over here I've had the as you can see over here I've had the valuation< valuation line up here and you can see valuation line up here and you can see it's< it's so much higher so at this point of it's so much higher so at this point of time< time if the valuation line is so high time if the valuation line is so high above< above where the current price is how do above where the current price is how do you< you get into the wheel strategy does it you get into the wheel strategy does it mean< mean that you can just sell the cash mean that you can just sell the cash putut< putut anywhere you want to well putut anywhere you want to well technically< technically you can but I like to be a technically you can but I like to be a little< little bit more conservative whereby I little bit more conservative whereby I will< will want to wait until the price goes will want to wait until the price goes down< down before I sell the Cashout putut so down before I sell the Cashout putut so the< the question is how do know where do you the question is how do know where do you sell< sell the cash cut put right how far sell the cash cut put right how far should< should the price go down before you should the price go down before you start< start selling the cash cut put so this start selling the cash cut put so this is< is where you can use What's called the is where you can use What's called the stochastic< stochastic oscillator so the stochastic stochastic oscillator so the stochastic oscillator< oscillator is a good way to identify oscillator is a good way to identify overbought< overbought or oversold conditions in the overbought or oversold conditions in the market< market so if you have been following my market so if you have been following my channel< channel for quite a while then you know channel for quite a while then you know that< that I have been referring to this that I have been referring to this oscillator< oscillator this stochastics for a number oscillator this stochastics for a number of< of the videos that have created for the of the videos that have created for the different< different strategies so of course again different strategies so of course again like< like I mentioned every time when I talk like I mentioned every time when I talk about< about a stochastic oscillator this is about a stochastic oscillator this is not< not some kind of me indicator that will not some kind of me indicator that will tell< tell you when the market will turn every tell you when the market will turn every time< time because there will be times where time because there will be times where the< the stock clastic might show an oversold the stock clastic might show an oversold reading< reading but the market continues to be reading but the market continues to be oversold< oversold for example over here as you oversold for example over here as you can< can see down here it shows oversold at can see down here it shows oversold at this< this point but the market continues to this point but the market continues to go< go down but at least at this point you go down but at least at this point you have< have a much better entry than if you have a much better entry than if you were< were to enter when the stochastic were to enter when the stochastic actually< actually shows it's overboard because if actually shows it's overboard because if you< you enter the cash out putut when it's you enter the cash out putut when it's overboard< overboard then this is where you're overboard then this is where you're going< going to be in a little a little bit of going to be in a little a little bit of pain< pain before the market eventually comes pain before the market eventually comes back< back up so rather than get in right at back up so rather than get in right at the< the top at least I want to get in when the top at least I want to get in when the< the market is going down it's retracing the market is going down it's retracing so< so this is something that you can use to so this is something that you can use to try< try and identify places for you to start try and identify places for you to start selling< selling the cash secure putut if the selling the cash secure putut if the valuation< valuation of the stock is way up there valuation of the stock is way up there so< so as you can see Google is still way up so as you can see Google is still way up there< there so that means that anywhere below there so that means that anywhere below this< this valuation line it's good for us to this valuation line it's good for us to sell< sell the cash Rec put but first I want sell the cash Rec put but first I want to< to wait until this stochastic shows an to wait until this stochastic shows an oversold< oversold reading so as you can see over oversold reading so as you can see over here< here there are a few times it actually here there are a few times it actually went< went overs so down here and it kind of went overs so down here and it kind of coincides< coincides with where the market turns so coincides with where the market turns so once< once it becomes oversold this is where I once it becomes oversold this is where I will< will go to the option chain and then I will go to the option chain and then I will< will look at where to sell the cash SEC will look at where to sell the cash SEC output< output so you may also take a look at output so you may also take a look at the< the support line if you want to as well the support line if you want to as well so< so let's say for example this is so let's say for example this is oversold< oversold and then down here is where the oversold and then down here is where the support< support you could consider waiting a support you could consider waiting a little< little bit lower before you sell a cash little bit lower before you sell a cash cut< cut below here if you want to but then cut below here if you want to but then again< again it's not that necessary because we again it's not that necessary because we already< already know that the valuation is already know that the valuation is pretty< pretty high up there and over the long pretty high up there and over the long term< term this stock can gravitate to this term this stock can gravitate to this valuation< valuation line so now that we've already valuation line so now that we've already decided< decided on the cash Rec putut when to decided on the cash Rec putut when to enter< enter into it the question is once I get enter into it the question is once I get a< a signed on the cash C putut do I hold a signed on the cash C putut do I hold on< on to the stock all the way until it on to the stock all the way until it goes< goes above this because as you can see goes above this because as you can see it's< it's still quite far away so the answer it's still quite far away so the answer really< really come comes down to you so I really come comes down to you so I myself< myself have the wheel strategy on Google myself have the wheel strategy on Google and< and for me I do the income grid wheel and for me I do the income grid wheel strategy< strategy where I have multiple trenches strategy where I have multiple trenches I< I have multiple cash SEC output so on a I have multiple cash SEC output so on a part< part of it I will actually hold on to it part of it I will actually hold on to it until< until it finally reaches the valuation until it finally reaches the valuation line< line then I start to sell the cover call line then I start to sell the cover call but< but then on a small part of it what I do but then on a small part of it what I do is< is that I'll actually also sell the is that I'll actually also sell the cover< cover call depending on this stochastic cover call depending on this stochastic oscillator< oscillator here so what I'm really oscillator here so what I'm really waiting< waiting is until it goes above this red waiting is until it goes above this red line< line where it shows the overbought line where it shows the overbought reading< reading now then I start to sell the reading now then I start to sell the cover< cover call so in this case down here you cover call so in this case down here you can< can see the market went above to this can see the market went above to this point< point down here and it shows the point down here and it shows the overboard< overboard reading this is where I overboard reading this is where I actually< actually sold the cover call so I sold a actually sold the cover call so I sold a cover< cover call somewhere at around 25 Deltas cover call somewhere at around 25 Deltas so< so this way if the market actually goes so this way if the market actually goes up< up above here then I would have quite a up above here then I would have quite a bit< bit of a nice profit from the capital bit of a nice profit from the capital gains< gains from where I got assigned and if gains from where I got assigned and if it< it doesn't get assigned then I'm going it doesn't get assigned then I'm going to< to wait again until it should and an to wait again until it should and an overboard< overboard reading so if it does overboard reading so if it does eventually< eventually get a sign let's say I sell eventually get a sign let's say I sell my< my covered call down here and the market my covered call down here and the market actually< actually goes up and then I get a sign actually goes up and then I get a sign then< then it doesn't matter as well because I then it doesn't matter as well because I still< still have a part of my stocks where I'm still have a part of my stocks where I'm still< still holding for the long term where I still holding for the long term where I can< can still continue to gain even more can still continue to gain even more capital< capital gains once it finally goes above capital gains once it finally goes above this< this valuation line down here so if you this valuation line down here so if you have< have multiple positions on this uh stock have multiple positions on this uh stock then< then you definitely have the choice then you definitely have the choice whether< whether you want to get them out below whether you want to get them out below the< the valuation line or hold them to the the valuation line or hold them to the valuation< valuation line so this is how I trade valuation line so this is how I trade the< the wheel strategy and I hope you found the wheel strategy and I hope you found this< this video helpful and if it has I this video helpful and if it has I greatly< greatly appreciate it if you click the greatly appreciate it if you click the thumbs< thumbs up button and also subscribe to thumbs up button and also subscribe to my< my videos and I will see you in the next my videos and I will see you in the next video

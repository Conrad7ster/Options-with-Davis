### The Bear Call Spread Assignment Reversal Strategy [7GpsJhpryvQ]
===================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in the last video all right alrighty so in the last video I< I talked about the bare put spread I talked about the bare put spread assignment< assignment reversal strategy so I shared assignment reversal strategy so I shared with< with you you know three simple ways for with you you know three simple ways for you< you to unwind any assignment on your you to unwind any assignment on your bull< bull boot spread now for this video we bull boot spread now for this video we are< are going to be talking about the blue are going to be talking about the blue put< put spreads counterpart which is the put spreads counterpart which is the bear< bear call spread right so what you do if bear call spread right so what you do if you< you get assigned on your bear call you get assigned on your bear call spread< spread so the backhoe spread is slightly spread so the backhoe spread is slightly different< different to what you would do when you different to what you would do when you get< get assigned to your boo boot spread so get assigned to your boo boot spread so you< you really want to pay attention to this you really want to pay attention to this so< so for this video I'm going to be so for this video I'm going to be sharing< sharing with you the back host spread sharing with you the back host spread assignment< assignment reversal strategy basically assignment reversal strategy basically also< also three simple steps to unwind a call also three simple steps to unwind a call Credit< Credit spread assignment so on the left Credit spread assignment so on the left hand< hand side you can see that we have the hand side you can see that we have the chart< chart and I also put on the call spread chart and I also put on the call spread so< so the question is when are you most so the question is when are you most likely< likely to get a sign on your back or likely to get a sign on your back or spread< spread so if you have watched the last spread so if you have watched the last video< video then you will know that it will video then you will know that it will only< only get assigned if you're short strike only get assigned if you're short strike the< the short leg of your credit spread be the short leg of your credit spread be the< the blue put spread or the back hold the blue put spread or the back hold spread< spread if it's in the money right if spread if it's in the money right if it's< it's out of the money there's no way it's out of the money there's no way it's< it's going to get assigned right if you it's going to get assigned right if you get< get a sign on it out the money option get a sign on it out the money option then< then you're in luck because you're gonna then you're in luck because you're gonna rip< rip the profits immediately right so rip the profits immediately right so it's< it's only normally when your short call it's only normally when your short call link< link is in the money for the bear call link is in the money for the bear call spread< spread okay and it's also when the spread okay and it's also when the extrinsic< extrinsic value of the shock call Lake extrinsic value of the shock call Lake is< is very little and usually when there's is very little and usually when there's not< not many days to expiration left and all not many days to expiration left and all your< your shock call Lake is deep in the your shock call Lake is deep in the money< money that means the market has gone all money that means the market has gone all the< the way past even your long call strike the way past even your long call strike price< price right so at this point you could price right so at this point you could get< get assigned pretty early depending on get assigned pretty early depending on you< you know how much extrinsic value left you know how much extrinsic value left and< and also more importantly if this stock and also more importantly if this stock which< which you're trading this Equity or which you're trading this Equity or index< index ETF actually pays a dividend right index ETF actually pays a dividend right so< so when the extrinsic value is lesser so when the extrinsic value is lesser than< than the dividend paid than the dividend paid if< if any right then there will be a chance if any right then there will be a chance for< for early assignment this is what you for early assignment this is what you call< call dividend risk now for the blue put call dividend risk now for the blue put spread< spread because we are doing uh the shot spread because we are doing uh the shot put< put right you only have the shot put leg put right you only have the shot put leg there< there is no dividend risk right there is there is no dividend risk right there is no< no such thing as dividend risk for the no such thing as dividend risk for the bull< bull put spread but for the bear call bull put spread but for the bear call spread< spread that is dividend risk because the spread that is dividend risk because the buyer< buyer of this call option basically now buyer of this call option basically now you< you are short the call option now the you are short the call option now the opposite< opposite side is basically the call opposite side is basically the call option< option buyer now this call option buyer option buyer now this call option buyer can< can choose to actually exercise his call can choose to actually exercise his call option< option and then get long 100 shares on option and then get long 100 shares on his< his end and the reason he might want to his end and the reason he might want to do< do that is because the stock could be do that is because the stock could be paying< paying a dividend that is much more than paying a dividend that is much more than the< the extrinsic value of this call option the extrinsic value of this call option that< that he's holding on to so for example that he's holding on to so for example if< if this call option right now let's say if this call option right now let's say only< only have 20 cents of extrinsic value only have 20 cents of extrinsic value left< left but for this stock right maybe it's left but for this stock right maybe it's paying< paying let's say about 50 cents for the paying let's say about 50 cents for the dividend< dividend so if the dividend let me just dividend so if the dividend let me just put< put div down here so you can see and put div down here so you can see and this< this is extrinsic value this is extrinsic value so< so if the dividend is more than the 20 so if the dividend is more than the 20 cents< cents of extrinsic value left then the cents of extrinsic value left then the buyer< buyer of this call option is more buyer of this call option is more incentivized< incentivized to exercise his call option incentivized to exercise his call option right< right because when he exercises he gets right because when he exercises he gets 100< 100 shares at the same time he will be 100 shares at the same time he will be able< able to get this 50 cents dividend now able to get this 50 cents dividend now if< if he was to just sell off his call if he was to just sell off his call option< option instead of exercising it he would option instead of exercising it he would only< only get 20 cents so it makes more sense only get 20 cents so it makes more sense for< for him to exercise it and then get this for him to exercise it and then get this dividend< dividend so this is where you also have dividend so this is where you also have to< to really pay attention to your to really pay attention to your extrinsic< extrinsic value as well as how much extrinsic value as well as how much dividend< dividend that the stock is actually dividend that the stock is actually paying< paying out now if the stock doesn't pay paying out now if the stock doesn't pay any< any dividend at all then you don't have any dividend at all then you don't have to< to worry about this so what happens when to worry about this so what happens when you< you assigned on your short call link so you assigned on your short call link so this< this is the opposite of the bull put this is the opposite of the bull put spread< spread the bull put spread on your shot spread the bull put spread on your shot put< put leg you will be long 100 shares but put leg you will be long 100 shares but because< because this is a short call what because this is a short call what happened< happened is that you will be shot 100 happened is that you will be shot 100 shares< shares Instead at the strike price of shares Instead at the strike price of your< your short call so in this example let's your short call so in this example let's say< say it's 200 so basically you'll be shot say it's 200 so basically you'll be shot 100< 100 shares at two hundred dollars and 100 shares at two hundred dollars and you< you may get a margin call if you don't you may get a margin call if you don't have< have sufficient funds to short the 100 have sufficient funds to short the 100 shares< shares so at this point what do you do shares so at this point what do you do now< now in my previous video on the blue put now in my previous video on the blue put spread< spread reversal strategy I mentioned to spread reversal strategy I mentioned to First< First reinstate the original option that First reinstate the original option that got< got assigned right basically it's the got assigned right basically it's the same< same strike and the same DTE and then same strike and the same DTE and then decide< decide whether you know you want to decide whether you know you want to close< close out the position or to roll the close out the position or to roll the position< position to a further DTE now after position to a further DTE now after releasing< releasing the video I've had a few releasing the video I've had a few people< people reach out to me and mentioned you people reach out to me and mentioned you know< know why do you want to do that right know why do you want to do that right why< why not just instead should we close out why not just instead should we close out the< the position or to roll it out to a the position or to roll it out to a further< further GTE and the only reason I did it further GTE and the only reason I did it that< that way is because the majority of the that way is because the majority of the people< people on my channel are new to trading people on my channel are new to trading options< options and I wanted to make it very options and I wanted to make it very step< step by step so they don't get confused step by step so they don't get confused right< right so for example let's say you right so for example let's say you already< already have the 100 shares and then you already have the 100 shares and then you have< have one long put at the bottom now if have one long put at the bottom now if you< you were to change this straight away if you were to change this straight away if you< you were to sell this off and then you you were to sell this off and then you sell< sell one maybe with a 50 DTE so what sell one maybe with a 50 DTE so what you're< you're going to be left with is you're you're going to be left with is you're going< going to have a 50 DTE shot put and then going to have a 50 DTE shot put and then you< you have 8dte long put down here and you you have 8dte long put down here and you know< know a lot of people when they're just know a lot of people when they're just new< new to training options they get a new to training options they get a little< little bit confused by this right why is little bit confused by this right why is there< there two different DTE so I wanted to there two different DTE so I wanted to just< just make it step by step but then again just make it step by step but then again now< now I understand that there are quite a now I understand that there are quite a number< number of overachievers that you guys number of overachievers that you guys here< here have been trading options for some here have been trading options for some time< time and you guys are pretty experienced time and you guys are pretty experienced and< and I like that right so for this video and I like that right so for this video I< I would just get right to the essential I would just get right to the essential steps< steps to reverse an assignment and cut steps to reverse an assignment and cut out< out all the shenanigans of you know out all the shenanigans of you know reinstating< reinstating the original positions all reinstating the original positions all right< right so there are two options once you right so there are two options once you are< are assigned all right so the very first are assigned all right so the very first option< option is to close out the whole option is to close out the whole position< position for a loss right so maybe position for a loss right so maybe you've< you've got a sign on your short call now you've got a sign on your short call now you< you have a short 100 shares and then you you have a short 100 shares and then you still< still have this long call option down still have this long call option down here< here what do you do now if you want to here what do you do now if you want to close< close this out for a loss well first of close this out for a loss well first of all< all here's the wrong way to do it right all here's the wrong way to do it right the< the wrong way to do this is to exercise the wrong way to do this is to exercise this< this long call option because if you this long call option because if you know< know if you were to exercise this long know if you were to exercise this long call< call option you'll basically be buying call option you'll basically be buying 100< 100 shares but the problem with this is 100 shares but the problem with this is that< that you'll be realizing the maximum that you'll be realizing the maximum loss< loss when it's not at a maximum loss loss when it's not at a maximum loss so< so you will only reach the maximum loss so you will only reach the maximum loss of< of a credit spread right be a call of a credit spread right be a call spread< spread or a put spread only at spread or a put spread only at expiration< expiration so if there's still time left expiration so if there's still time left in< in your spread it's not going to be a in your spread it's not going to be a Max< Max loss yet unless it's so deep in the Max loss yet unless it's so deep in the money< money right unless it's extremely deep money right unless it's extremely deep in< in the money whereby this uh call option in the money whereby this uh call option does< does not even have any extrinsic value does not even have any extrinsic value but< but for the most part there should. be but for the most part there should be still< still some value inside your call option still some value inside your call option some< some extrinsic value so there's no real some extrinsic value so there's no real need< need for you to exercise this call need for you to exercise this call option< option right if you exercise this you're option right if you exercise this you're going< going to realize your max loss going to realize your max loss immediately< immediately which you do not have to so immediately which you do not have to so instead< instead what you want to do is this instead what you want to do is this right< right you want to buy back the 100 right you want to buy back the 100 shares< shares So when you buy back the 100 shares So when you buy back the 100 shares< shares you have no longer any position shares you have no longer any position here< here then all you have to do is just here then all you have to do is just close< close out this long call position right close out this long call position right and< and then you do all this in a single and then you do all this in a single order< order ticket so it's actually very order ticket so it's actually very simple< simple and when you sell with this call simple and when you sell with this call option< option chances are that there are still option chances are that there are still some< some extrinsic value left in this some extrinsic value left in this caution< caution so is this extrinsic value in caution so is this extrinsic value in this< this call option that's going to help this call option that's going to help you< you reduce the maximum loss right your you reduce the maximum loss right your maximum< maximum loss is basically the width of maximum loss is basically the width of the< the spread minus all of the credit that the spread minus all of the credit that you< you receive for this call spread all you receive for this call spread all right< right so if you have still some right so if you have still some extrinsic< extrinsic value in this call option left extrinsic value in this call option left by< by selling this call option instead of by selling this call option instead of exercising< exercising it you're still going to get exercising it you're still going to get you< you know back some value which you would you know back some value which you would have< have lost if you were to just exercise have lost if you were to just exercise it< it because remember when you exercise an it because remember when you exercise an option< option you basically just four feet any option you basically just four feet any extrinsic< extrinsic value that you have right so extrinsic value that you have right so instead< instead of just exercising it just sell instead of just exercising it just sell it< it off okay so this is for option one if it off okay so this is for option one if you< you want to close out the whole position you want to close out the whole position for< for a loss now option two what if you for a loss now option two what if you are< are still bearish and you think that the are still bearish and you think that the market< market might actually come down now in market might actually come down now in the< the previous video I'll talk about the previous video I'll talk about reinstated< reinstated it and then from there you reinstated it and then from there you can< can actually see whether you're going to can actually see whether you're going to get< get a credit or a debit for rolling it get a credit or a debit for rolling it right< right so that's one of the things why I right so that's one of the things why I mentioned< mentioned to reinstate the original mentioned to reinstate the original position< position now if you don't reinstate the position now if you don't reinstate the original< original position then this is where you original position then this is where you need< need to be you know pretty clear are you need to be you know pretty clear are you going< going to get a credit or a debit and going to get a credit or a debit and you're< you're going to get a debit do you still you're going to get a debit do you still want< want to roll out to a further time you want to roll out to a further time you know< know just to hold on to this spread you know just to hold on to this spread you know< know slightly increase your risk and know slightly increase your risk and maybe< maybe the trade will work out in your maybe the trade will work out in your favor< favor right so if you choose this option favor right so if you choose this option then< then this will be the way to do it right then this will be the way to do it right so< so first of all you want to buy back the so first of all you want to buy back the 100< 100 shares and then you want to sell a 100 shares and then you want to sell a call< call option with the same strike but call option with the same strike but with< with a longer DTE that means you have with a longer DTE that means you have already< already assumed that you want to roll already assumed that you want to roll out< out to a later DTE right so let's say out to a later DTE right so let's say for< for example the original one was maybe a for example the original one was maybe a DTE DTE DTE okay< okay so the original one was ADT so both okay so the original one was ADT so both of< of this will be 8 DT so what you want to of this will be 8 DT so what you want to do< do is step one and two you want to do do is step one and two you want to do this< this together right this two steps this together right this two steps together together together and< and if you do this two steps together and if you do this two steps together there< there won't be that legging risk there won't be that legging risk otherwise< otherwise there'll be a legging wrist so otherwise there'll be a legging wrist so you< you want to buy back the 100 shares and you want to buy back the 100 shares and then< then sell a call option with the same then sell a call option with the same strike< strike but with a longer DTE that means strike but with a longer DTE that means this< this strike which your short call is at this strike which your short call is at so< so maybe this time you want to change it so maybe this time you want to change it to< to I don't know maybe something like 50 to I don't know maybe something like 50 DTE< DTE so now when you do step one and two DTE so now when you do step one and two together< together what you will end up with would together what you will end up with would be< be a short call with 50 DTE so now be a short call with 50 DTE so now you're< you're left with a long call of ADT what you're left with a long call of ADT what do< do you do right so there are many things do you do right so there are many things you< you can do with this and I want to just you can do with this and I want to just keep< keep things very simple because if keep things very simple because if you're< you're not that advanced and then you you're not that advanced and then you see< see one with an ADT one with a 50 DT you see one with an ADT one with a 50 DT you may< may get confused on what to do may get confused on what to do right< right so if you were to just roll it as right so if you were to just roll it as per< per usual let's say for example the per usual let's say for example the original< original position would be two eight original position would be two eight dtes< dtes right so this will be ADT call dtes right so this will be ADT call spread< spread now assume that at the point of spread now assume that at the point of time< time you hadn't got assigned what would time you hadn't got assigned what would you< you have done if you wanted to roll you you have done if you wanted to roll you would< would just roll both of them to 50 DTE would just roll both of them to 50 DTE correct< correct right if that's the DTE that you correct right if that's the DTE that you choose< choose so for this long call since now choose so for this long call since now you< you have already done the short call you have already done the short call portion< portion because it was originally portion because it was originally assigned< assigned now you change it to a 50 DT assigned now you change it to a 50 DT shot< shot call the same strike if you have shot call the same strike if you have rolled< rolled it the whole position the rolled it the whole position the original< original position this would also become original position this would also become a< a 50 DTE so what's left right here a 50 DTE so what's left right here is< is to roll this long call option to the is to roll this long call option to the same< same DTE as your shot call so at this same DTE as your shot call so at this point< point in time point in time when< when you roll it now you will have a when you roll it now you will have a call< call spread with 50 DTE at the same call spread with 50 DTE at the same strike< strike now whether it's going to be an strike now whether it's going to be an overall< overall credit or a debit really depends overall credit or a debit really depends on< on whether the current price is closer on whether the current price is closer to< to the short call or the long call right to the short call or the long call right if< if it's closer to the short call maybe if it's closer to the short call maybe it's< it's somewhere around this price down it's somewhere around this price down here< here then chances are it will be for an here then chances are it will be for an overall< overall credit that means your maximum overall credit that means your maximum risk< risk on the trade would actually be risk on the trade would actually be reduced< reduced but if it's actually closer to reduced but if it's actually closer to this< this long call option down here or if this long call option down here or if it's< it's already way past this long call it's already way past this long call option< option then chances are it's going to be option then chances are it's going to be for< for a debit that means you're going to for a debit that means you're going to pay< pay to roll it because essentially if if pay to roll it because essentially if if you< you think about it what you're actually you think about it what you're actually doing< doing is just rolling it to a further doing is just rolling it to a further GTE< GTE right the only difference is the GTE right the only difference is the extra< extra step right because you have been extra step right because you have been assigned< assigned the 100 shares in the first assigned the 100 shares in the first place< place so whether you want to roll it for place so whether you want to roll it for a< a debit 100 is your discretion because a debit 100 is your discretion because if< if you think that the market is going to if you think that the market is going to go< go down then you know rolling for that go down then you know rolling for that additional< additional debit for you know a couple additional debit for you know a couple of< of cents I don't know maybe 20 30 50 of cents I don't know maybe 20 30 50 cents< cents could actually you know be good in cents could actually you know be good in the< the longer picture or rather in a bigger the longer picture or rather in a bigger picture< picture because if the market comes down picture because if the market comes down expires< expires out of money then you're going expires out of money then you're going to< to profit on this whole position but to profit on this whole position but then< then again you need to think that you then again you need to think that you know< know what if the market continues going know what if the market continues going up< up then this is where you need to know up then this is where you need to know when< when you're gonna cut loss when you're when you're gonna cut loss when you're gonna< gonna take a loss and your wrist would gonna take a loss and your wrist would have< have been bigger compared before but have been bigger compared before but then< then again I want to put out this option then again I want to put out this option because< because some of you do want to still because some of you do want to still hold< hold on to this backhoe spread and not hold on to this backhoe spread and not let< let this assignment get in the way of let this assignment get in the way of your< your original idea of putting on this your original idea of putting on this bear< bear call spread right especially if bear call spread right especially if your< your original Short call option or your original Short call option or rather< rather this whole uh call spread has too rather this whole uh call spread has too many< many days left right let's say for many days left right let's say for example< example what if it has 38 DTE left and example what if it has 38 DTE left and you< you have been assigned on the short call you have been assigned on the short call right< right if you have been assigned at 38 right if you have been assigned at 38 DTE< DTE then you know this would a little DTE then you know this would a little bit< bit kind of disrupt your strategy right bit kind of disrupt your strategy right especially< especially if you go according to you especially if you go according to you know< know you want to exit at 21 DTE then at know you want to exit at 21 DTE then at this< this point yeah you want to resume it this point yeah you want to resume it and< and if it's for debit you could consider and if it's for debit you could consider you< you know going for a debit all right but you know going for a debit all right but the< the best thing still is to try and avoid the best thing still is to try and avoid an< an assignment in the first place by the an assignment in the first place by the way< way if you like this video so far Please way if you like

com blueprint or< or right back to the video how do you or right back to the video how do you actually< actually prevent and avoid early actually prevent and avoid early assignment< assignment in the first place right assignment in the first place right prevention< prevention again better than cure rather prevention again better than cure rather than< than get into the whole mess of you know than get into the whole mess of you know having< having to unwind having the margin call having to unwind having the margin call and< and then you will have a lot of anxiety and then you will have a lot of anxiety and< and stress why not just remove that and stress why not just remove that whole< whole early assignment risk in the first whole early assignment risk in the first place< place so how do you do this well the place so how do you do this well the first< first way is basically to just exit at first way is basically to just exit at 21< 21 DTE when your short call Lake is in 21 DTE when your short call Lake is in the< the money right so if there's still like the money right so if there's still like let's< let's say 30 days left to expiration and let's say 30 days left to expiration and if< if it's in the money you don't really if it's in the money you don't really have< have to worry because there's still some have to worry because there's still some extrinsic< extrinsic value left chances of you extrinsic value left chances of you getting< getting early assigned is still low now getting early assigned is still low now if< if for some reason you do get you know if for some reason you do get you know early< early assigned and there's still more early assigned and there's still more than< than 21 DTE then basically you just go than 21 DTE then basically you just go back< back to do this three steps which I've back to do this three steps which I've shared< shared with you all right but if you shared with you all right but if you don't< don't get assigned and it's roughly don't get assigned and it's roughly around< around 21 DTE and your short call strike around 21 DTE and your short call strike is< is in the money just exit the trade is in the money just exit the trade right< right just exit this whole spread and right just exit this whole spread and then< then just wait for another opportunity then just wait for another opportunity to< to enter again right the other way is to to enter again right the other way is to basically< basically just trade the cash shuttle basically just trade the cash shuttle index< index options right the SPX XSP and DX index options right. the SPX XSP and DX the< the rod so on and so forth because with the rod so on and so forth because with this< this options all right with this cash this options all right with this cash shuttle< shuttle index options basically they are shuttle index options basically they are European< European style so again I already European style so again I already mentioned< mentioned this in the last video If you mentioned this in the last video If you haven't< haven't watched that please go and watch haven't watched that please go and watch that< that as well so this European style that as well so this European style basically< basically there is no early assignment basically there is no early assignment at< at all right you are not allowed to at all right you are not allowed to exercise< exercise the option if you have long exercise the option if you have long options< options you're not allowed to exercise options you're not allowed to exercise this< this before expiration the only time you this before expiration the only time you can< can excise it is only at expiration so can excise it is only at expiration so in< in this case you can actually hold your in this case you can actually hold your spread< spread all the way to expiration right spread all the way to expiration right so< so if you hold all the way to expiration so if you hold all the way to expiration the< the broker or just tabulate whether is the broker or just tabulate whether is it< it a profit and loss and then they will it a profit and loss and then they will either< either you know credit or debit your either you know credit or debit your trading< trading account depending on the p l all trading account depending on the p l all right< right guys so this is the bad call right guys so this is the bad call spread< spread assignment reversal strategy by spread assignment reversal strategy by the< the way if you like this video then the way if you like this video then

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you a no I'm going to be sharing with you a no loss< loss option strategy which is something loss option strategy which is something pretty< pretty controversial right because if pretty controversial right because if you< you have been watching a number of my you have been watching a number of my videos< videos then you will notice that I've videos then you will notice that I've been< been saying that you know there is no been saying that you know there is no strategy< strategy that has absolutely no risk strategy that has absolutely no risk right< right because if you put on you know any right because if you put on you know any strategy< strategy you risk your Capital there's strategy you risk your Capital there's always< always you know some chance that you're always you know some chance that you're going< going to lose some money so basically no going to lose some money so basically no such< such thing as a 100% win rate kind of such thing as a 100% win rate kind of strategy< strategy right so why did I actually strategy right so why did I actually create< create this video to share with you you create this video to share with you you know< know the title as the no loss option know the title as the no loss option strategy< strategy well believe it or not you'll strategy well believe it or not you'll be< be pretty surprised that I do have some be pretty surprised that I do have some people< people that actually you know reach out people that actually you know reach out to< to me and ask me questions like you know to me and ask me questions like you know Davis< Davis can I have you know a strategy Davis can I have you know a strategy that< that have no losses or is there any that have no losses or is there any strategy< strategy you know off that there 100% strategy you know off that there 100% win< win rate or at least 99% win rate well win rate or at least 99% win rate well the< the answer is that there is actually one the answer is that there is actually one strategy< strategy that I know of that is the strategy that I know of that is the closest< closest to being a no loss option closest to being a no loss option strategy< strategy right so I'm going to be strategy right so I'm going to be sharing< sharing with you in this video so are sharing with you in this video so are you< you ready if you are I'm going to do you ready if you are I'm going to do some< some drum some drum roll< roll so the closest thing that at least roll so the closest thing that at least I< I know of to being a no loss option I know of to being a no loss option strategy< strategy is the wheel strategy now strategy is the wheel strategy now before< before you start saying what the people before you start saying what the people your< your mother beep and all sorts of you your mother beep and all sorts of you know< know cute and adorable words you're know cute and adorable words you're about< about throw at me which I appreciate by about throw at me which I appreciate by the< the way no don't don't say that to me the way no don't don't say that to me guys< guys my feelings will be hurt but the guys my feelings will be hurt but the wheel< wheel strategy is the only strategy that wheel strategy is the only strategy that I< I think is the closest to being a no I think is the closest to being a no loss< loss option strategy now no no before loss option strategy now no no before you< you start to get very angry and start to you start to get very angry and start to slam< slam the table and start to you know uh slam the table and start to you know uh punch< punch the screen just to reach out at my punch the screen just to reach out at my face< face there is an trick that you need to face there is an trick that you need to take< take a look at right as you can see down take a look at right as you can see down here< here I have a very clear big ASX down here I have a very clear big ASX down here< here that you need to see so this is here that you need to see so this is what< what you call a fine print that you need what you call a fine print that you need to< to read so whenever you see any to read so whenever you see any documents< documents right that has an Asis at the documents right that has an Asis at the end< end of the sentence you need to know end of the sentence you need to know that< that there is a fine print right the that there is a fine print right the fine< fine print means you better read it or fine print means you better read it or else< else you know things might go wrong so else you know things might go wrong so here's< here's the fine print the fine print is here's the fine print the fine print is only< only when traded in a certain way right only when traded in a certain way right when< when you trade it in a certain way there when you trade it in a certain way there are< are a few criteria which I'm going to be are a few criteria which I'm going to be sharing< sharing with you of course right in this sharing with you of course right in this video< video I'm not going to just leave it to video I'm not going to just leave it to you< you you know just saying the wheel you you know just saying the wheel strategy< strategy and you trade it and all a strategy and you trade it and all a sudden< sudden you lose money and then you come sudden you lose money and then you come find< find me right no I'm going to actually find me right no I'm going to actually share< share with you the criteria so the wheel share with you the criteria so the wheel strategy< strategy can be pretty much close to a strategy can be pretty much close to a no< no loss option strategy if you trade it no loss option strategy if you trade it in< in a certain way right if you trade it in a certain way right if you trade it the< the right way now when I talk about the the right way now when I talk about the wheel< wheel strategy there might be two camps wheel strategy there might be two camps right< right now right right the first cam right now right right the first cam might< might be thinking or saying hey Davis might be thinking or saying hey Davis the< the wheel strategy is a no loss option the wheel strategy is a no loss option strategy< strategy you know I've been using the strategy you know I've been using the wheel< wheel strategy for a long time I've not wheel strategy for a long time I've not lost< lost money what are you talking about lost money what are you talking about this< this is obviously a no loss strategy this is obviously a no loss strategy well< well if you're thinking this way then well if you're thinking this way then I'm< I'm going to give you a wakeup call I'm going to give you a wakeup call because< because it is not a no loss option because it is not a no loss option strategy< strategy at least just by the design of strategy at least just by the design of this< this strategy because if the market this strategy because if the market crashes< crashes you know if the underlying that crashes you know if the underlying that you< you choose goes to zero you're going to you choose goes to zero you're going to lose< lose a lot of money right you're going lose a lot of money right you're going to< to lose pretty much everything that you to lose pretty much everything that you put< put into the underlying for the strategy put into the underlying for the strategy right< right now the other Camp might be saying right now the other Camp might be saying Davis< Davis yeah more cute and adorable words Davis yeah more cute and adorable words thrown< thrown at my face then I want to tell thrown at my face then I want to tell you< you that hey you're right right because you that hey you're right right because the< the wheel strategy can actually lose the wheel strategy can actually lose quite< quite a lot of money if you don't know quite a lot of money if you don't know what< what you're doing right in fact I agree what you're doing right in fact I agree with< with you that the wheel strategy can be with you that the wheel strategy can be risky< risky depending how you trade so in fact risky depending how you trade so in fact I'm< I'm actually going to share with you I'm actually going to share with you some< some horror stories that I went to to some horror stories that I went to to the< the web to you know scour the web to to the web to you know scour the web to to find< find out for right so here are a few find out for right so here are a few wheel< wheel strategy horror stor so before you wheel strategy horror stor so before you go< go ahead and you know just stop the go ahead and you know just stop the video< video thinking that oh the wheel video thinking that oh the wheel strategy< strategy is a no loss option strategy strategy is a no loss option strategy I'm< I'm just going to dive right straight I'm just going to dive right straight into< into it and trade it watch this first into it and trade it watch this first right< right so I went to the web and just right so I went to the web and just typed< typed you know wheel strategy horror typed you know wheel strategy horror stories< stories and a few stories just came up stories and a few stories just came up on< on Reddit so as you can see down here on Reddit so as you can see down here this< this person over here he sold the tqqq this person over here he sold the tqqq puts< puts at 150 when it was 174 so seemingly puts at 150 when it was 174 so seemingly it< it seems you know pretty safe by the way it seems you know pretty safe by the way tqqq< tqqq is not exactly the same as QQQ tqqq is not exactly the same as QQQ which< which is the you know Tech index ETF now which is the you know Tech index ETF now tqqq< tqqq is a leverage index ETF and when tqqq is a leverage index ETF and when you< you use a leverage index ETF to trade you use a leverage index ETF to trade the< the underlying you better know what the underlying you better know what you're< you're doing right because it's very you're doing right because it's very different< different from Trading the QQQ right different from Trading the QQQ right although< although you get much more you know although you get much more you know implied< implied volatility you get higher implied volatility you get higher premiums< premiums then is a mechanism that you premiums then is a mechanism that you need< need to be aware of and that is the need to be aware of and that is the daily< daily reset which you know makes the daily reset which you know makes the whole< whole strategy doesn't really work when whole strategy doesn't really work when it< it comes to option strategy so as you it comes to option strategy so as you can< can see down here he says his losses is can see down here he says his losses is in< in the whole of something like in the whole of something like $2,500< $2,500 right so he says I knew the risk $2,500 right so he says I knew the risk so< so I'll just keep selling above my cost so I'll just keep selling above my cost basis< basis until I'm at least even and basis until I'm at least even and probably< probably switched to the normal QQQ so probably switched to the normal QQQ so he< he realizes that the tqqq is a little he realizes that the tqqq is a little bit< bit too good to be true right that you bit too good to be true right that you can< can keep selling you know the put can keep selling you know the put options< options and call options with a lot of options and call options with a lot of uh< uh premium and then you know you think uh premium and then you know you think that< that you're going to make a lot money that you're going to make a lot money well< well always a catch right so always be well always a catch right so always be careful< careful the next one right as you can careful the next one right as you can see< see down here he says I'm sitting at a see down here he says I'm sitting at a $3,500< $3,500 loss right again same thing right $3,500 loss right again same thing right real< real strategy if you get the timing real strategy if you get the timing wrong< wrong and the market just crashes after wrong and the market just crashes after you< you get into the trade then you're going you get into the trade then you're going to< to be in for a very you know roller to be in for a very you know roller coaster< coaster ride where your emotion is going coaster ride where your emotion is going to< to be up and down right because you're to be up and down right because you're going< going to see that the market if it going to see that the market if it doesn't< doesn't recover it doesn't go back up to doesn't recover it doesn't go back up to where< where you sold your short putut at going where you sold your short putut at going to< to lose a lot of money right another one to lose a lot of money right another one as< as well you can see he did the wheel on as well you can see he did the wheel on Maes< Maes and it shot through my strike I was Maes and it shot through my strike I was never< never able to get my cost bases back never able to get my cost bases back right< right and then uh another one I saw a right and then uh another one I saw a $140< $140 put on ayx right before earnings so $140 put on ayx right before earnings so one< one the reasons why I don't like to one the reasons why I don't like to trade< trade earnings is also because of this trade earnings is also because of this right< right it's pretty much like a gamble in right it's pretty much like a gamble in a< a sense because the earnings can really a sense because the earnings can really make< make the price move a lot right either a make the price move a lot right either a huge< huge gap up or gap down and that can huge gap up or gap down and that can really< really you know affect your trade right really you know affect your trade right especially< especially if you are to trade something especially if you are to trade something like< like the wheel strategy over there so as like the wheel strategy over there so as you< you can see this one trade wiped out you can see this one trade wiped out literally< literally months worth of profits and literally months worth of profits and finally< finally this is from one of my YouTube finally this is from one of my YouTube subscribers< subscribers where he you know just subscribers where he you know just shared< shared with me you know his uh trade shared with me you know his uh trade that< that went wrong when he did the wheel that went wrong when he did the wheel strategy< strategy as you can see he went you know strategy as you can see he went you know pretty< pretty much all in into Tesla as you can pretty much all in into Tesla as you can see< see you know quite a lot of Tesla trades see you know quite a lot of Tesla trades down< down here and he went down roughly about down here and he went down roughly about $116,000< $116,000 so as you can see down here the $116,000 so as you can see down here the wheel< wheel strategy is not a no loss option wheel strategy is not a no loss option strategy< strategy right not by any stretch right strategy right not by any stretch right you< you can really lose a lot of money you can really lose a lot of money especially< especially if you don't know what you're especially if you don't know what you're doing< doing so the question is that if the doing so the question is that if the wheel< wheel strategy is risky how is it wheel strategy is risky how is it possible< possible that you can make it into a no possible that you can make it into a no loss< loss option strategy all right so bear loss option strategy all right so bear with< with me I'm going to walk you through a with me I'm going to walk you through a few< few criteria that you know you do really few criteria that you know you do really need< need to use in the real strategy in need to use. in the real strategy in order< order to make it to be the closest thing order to make it to be the closest thing to< to having a no loss option strategy so to having a no loss option strategy so first< first of all let's just have a you know first of all let's just have a you know overview< overview of what the real strategy is in overview of what the real strategy is in case< case you're not familiar right so let's case you're not familiar right so let's put< put everybody at the right track so put everybody at the right track so everybody< everybody have an understanding of what everybody have an understanding of what this< this real strategy is so the real this real strategy is so the real strategy< strategy is actually a pretty simple strategy is actually a pretty simple strategy< strategy first off you start off by strategy first off you start off by selling< selling a cash secure put so basically selling a cash secure put so basically with< with a cash secure put what it means is with a cash secure put what it means is that< that you actually intend to get assigned that you actually intend to get assigned on< on this option right if the market goes on this option right if the market goes down< down below this cash secure put and then down below this cash secure put and then at< at expiration you're going to get at expiration you're going to get assigned< assigned 100 shares per option that you assigned 100 shares per option that you put< put on right so make sure that you have put on right so make sure that you have the< the necessary the necessary cash< cash for this underline now the next cash for this underline now the next step< step is to get assigned like I mentioned step is to get assigned like I mentioned right< right so if you're not assigned well you right so if you're not assigned well you just< just have to sell the cash secure put just have to sell the cash secure put over< over and over again until you get ass over and over again until you get ass sign< sign right so the cash secure put sign right so the cash secure put whenever< whenever you sell it you get some whenever you sell it you get some premium< premium all right so once you're premium all right so once you're assigned< assigned the next step is to sell a assigned the next step is to sell a covered< covered call now the covered call can be covered call now the covered call can be either< either at the money or out of the money either at the money or out of the money all< all right at the money just basically all right at the money just basically means< means that you're selling it exactly at means that you're selling it exactly at the< the place where you got assigned those the place where you got assigned those shares< shares right so basically what you're shares right so basically what you're doing< doing is that you're just getting the doing is that you're just getting the premium< premium from selling the cover call you premium from selling the cover call you also< also got the premium from selling the also got the premium from selling the cash< cash secure foot and there's no capital cash secure foot and there's no capital gains< gains right no capital gains because you gains right no capital gains because you are< are you know buying sort of like you're are you know buying sort of like you're getting< getting assigned the shares at the same getting assigned the shares at the same price< price and then you are getting it called price and then you are getting it called away< away at the same price so there's no uh away at the same price so there's no uh capital< capital gains there but if you want some capital gains there but if you want some capital< capital gains which means is the profit capital gains which means is the profit from< from the difference of where you you from the difference of where you you know< know got assign the shares long the know got assign the shares long the shares< shares and then you get out the shares shares and then you get out the shares so< so as you can see down here let's say so as you can see down here let's say for< for example you put the cover call at for example you put the cover call at 175< 175 then let's say if the market goes up 175 then let's say if the market goes up and< and your shares get called away then and your shares get called away then this< this is where your capital gains is it's this is where your capital gains is it's just< just basically the difference so this is just basically the difference so this is pretty< pretty much just the wheel strategy pretty much just the wheel strategy right< right it's pretty simple so all you have right it's pretty simple so all you have to< to do next is just rinse and repeat and to do next is just rinse and repeat and then< then just do it all over again now that then just do it all over again now that we< we all have the same understanding on we all have the same understanding on what< what the wheel strategy is the question what the wheel strategy is the question is< is how do you turn the wheel Strate is how do you turn the wheel Strate strategy< strategy into a no loss strategy or at strategy into a no loss strategy or at least< least the closest to having a no loss least the closest to having a no loss option< option strategy well there are a few option strategy well there are a few criteria< criteria and actually there are three criteria and actually there are three criteria< criteria that you need to implement so criteria that you need to implement so the< the very first criteria the first the very first criteria the first criteria< criteria is called vertical criteria is called vertical diversification< diversification so what exactly is diversification so what exactly is vertical< vertical diversification so vertical vertical diversification so vertical diversification< diversification is the opposite of diversification is the opposite of horizontal< horizontal diversification so horizontal horizontal diversification so horizontal divers< divers ification basically just means divers ification basically just means that< that you have multiple different stocks that you have multiple different stocks and< and then you are training the strategy and then you are training the strategy on< on it so let's say for example you have on it so let's say for example you have stock< stock a b c and d and all you're doing stock a b c and d and all you're doing is< is just doing the wheel strategy on each is just doing the wheel strategy on each of< of them right so that means you are of them right so that means you are doing< doing just one cash secure putut down doing just one cash secure putut down here< here another cash secure putut right so here another cash secure putut right so minus< minus one down here minus one - one minus one down here minus one - one minus< minus one right and then if you get a minus one right and then if you get a sign< sign or any of them basically you're sign or any of them basically you're just< just going through the the whole wheel just going through the the whole wheel strategy< strategy routine so this is what is strategy routine so this is what is called< called horizontal diversification but called horizontal diversification but horizontal< horizontal diversification has one flaw horizontal diversification has one flaw is< is that when the market crashes is that when the market crashes everything< everything goes down right regardless of everything goes down right regardless of you< you know the sector or at least most you know the sector or at least most sectors< sectors will actually start to crash as sectors will actually start to crash as you've< you've witnessed during the pandemic as you've witnessed during the pandemic as well< well as in 2022 which is where a lot of well as in 2022 which is where a lot of people< people actually got caught in their people actually got caught in their wheel< wheel strategy so if you have many many wheel strategy so if you have many many different< different stocks back then and you're different stocks back then and you're doing< doing the wheel on them then you notice doing the wheel on them then you notice that< that all the stocks will be pretty much that all the stocks will be pretty much caught< caught in a sense whereby the price of caught in a sense whereby the price of the< the underlying will be way below where the underlying will be way below where you< you know you sold your cash secure putut you know you sold your cash secure putut so< so that is why I don't really like uh so that is why I don't really like uh doing< doing horizontal diversification by doing horizontal diversification by itself< itself what I would suggest is to do itself what I would suggest is to do what< what is called the vertical what is called the vertical diversification< diversification and that means to have diversification and that means to have multiple< multiple levels instead of just one multiple levels instead of just one right< right so if you use just one level and right so if you use just one level and you're< you're wrong on the timing you could get you're wrong on the timing you could get stuck< stuck in the trade for a long time or stuck in the trade for a long time or the< the stock might just not go back to that the stock might just not go back to that level< level right so for example if you did it level right so for example if you did it on< on PayPal around 2022 or you know late on PayPal around 2022 or you know late 2021< 2021 then you're probably still in that 2021 then you're probably still in that trade< trade right suddenly a short-term trade trade right suddenly a short-term trade has< has now become a a long-term investing has now become a a long-term investing trade< trade where you're hoping to finally trade where you're hoping to finally break< break even when you get your pension so break even when you get your pension so instead< instead of putting you know the wheel instead of putting you know the wheel strategy< strategy in terms of horizontal strategy in terms of horizontal diversification< diversification where you you know split diversification where you you know split your< your Capital into different your Capital into different underlyings< underlyings vertical diversification is underlyings vertical diversification is instead< instead of you selling just one you instead of you selling just one you actually< actually sell multiple right you don't actually sell multiple right you don't just< just sell one you have many many many just sell one you have many many many all< all of this cash outut as the market all of this cash outut as the market goes< goes down so what you essentially doing goes down so what you essentially doing is< is that you're sort of like averaging is that you're sort of like averaging down< down as the market goes down you're down as the market goes down you're entering< entering into the trade as it goes down entering into the trade as it goes down and< and then when the market goes back up and then when the market goes back up you< you can start to sell cover calls for you can start to sell cover calls for the< the different levels right so the market the different levels right so the market as< as it goes down if it continues to go as it goes down if it continues to go down< down you're always just selling you know down you're always just selling you know the< the levels there's always something for the levels there's always something for you< you to do rather than you getting stuck you to do rather than you getting stuck with< with you know all the underlying down with you know all the underlying down here< here and then there's nothing to do here and then there's nothing to do because< because if all your stocks you know are because if all your stocks you know are pretty< pretty much deep underwater then there's pretty much deep underwater then there's not< not much you can do you can't really not much you can do you can't really sell< sell a cover call as well because it's sell a cover call as well because it's it's< it's just too too far away for you to it's just too too far away for you to sell< sell the cover call to get any premium sell the cover call to get any premium right< right so vertical diversification now right so vertical diversification now you< you might be thinking D this is so risky you might be thinking D this is so risky right< right because what if the stock goes to right because what if the stock goes to zero< zero so hang on to your pants first hang zero so hang on to your pants first hang on< on to your pants and if you're not on to your pants and if you're not wearing wearing wearing pants< pants why go please go wear some pants pants why go please go wear some pants before< before you continue watching the rest of before you continue watching the rest of the< the videos okay okay David stop that now the videos okay okay David stop that now I< I do understand that of course it's I do understand that of course it's going< going to be risky which is why there are going to be risky which is why there are two< two more other criteria all right so two more other criteria all right so hold< hold on to your horses hang on to your hold on to your horses hang on to your pants< pants wherever it is I will get there in pants wherever it is I will get there in the< the next few slides right now how do you the next few slides right now how do you actually< actually you know Place those cash to actually you know Place those cash to food< food I actually went this in depth in food I actually went this in depth in other< other videos so this is pretty much what other videos so this is pretty much what is< is called the income grid real strategy is called the income grid real strategy right< right just go to my channel search for right just go to my channel search for income< income grid real strategy and you'll be income grid real strategy and you'll be able< able to find quite a few videos on that able to find quite a few videos on that but< but generally uh how we want to split up but generally uh how we want to split up this< this uh cash secure out putut the levels this uh cash secure out putut the levels is< is based by you know either fixed dollar is based by you know either fixed dollar intervals< intervals so maybe you want one that is intervals so maybe you want one that is $10< $10 aart all right just as example okay $10 aart all right just as example okay or< or maybe percentage wise so maybe you or maybe percentage wise so maybe you have< have decided that this will be around have decided that this will be around 80%< 80% then maybe this will be 80% then maybe this will be 75%< 75% then this will be at 75% then this will be at 70%< 70% and maybe you want to go all the way 70% and maybe you want to go all the way down< down to 50% thinking that maybe the down to 50% thinking that maybe the underline< underline you know it's pretty difficult underline you know it's pretty difficult to< to get to 50% and if it does it'll be a to get to 50% and if it does it'll be a pretty< pretty nice discount on the underlying pretty nice discount on the underlying that< that you actually want to get long that you actually want to get long anywhere< anywhere so vertical diversification is anywhere so vertical diversification is the< the very first criterial and you the very first criterial and you definitely< definitely want to choose it on a stock definitely want to choose it on a stock that< that you want to own right not just go that you want to own right not just go for< for a stock that has High volatility and for a stock that has High volatility and you< you know thinking that you're going to you know thinking that you're going to get< get a lot of Premium right I'll stay get a lot of Premium right I'll stay away< away from that so that is why we're away from that so that is why we're going< going to move on to the next criterial going to move on to the next criterial and< and that is choosing a proven underlying and that is choosing a proven underlying by< by the way if you like this video so far by the way if you like this video so far Please< Please Subscribe and also click the Please Subscribe and also

com blueprint all right back to< to the video so this is very important to the video so this is very important right< right this is Paramount to whether this right this is Paramount to whether this strategy< strategy is going to be no loss or full strategy is going to be no loss or full of< of losses for you right or maximum loss of losses for you right or maximum loss for< for you because the underlying really for you because the underlying really determines< determines whether the real strategy is determines whether the real strategy is going< going to be successful for you or not going to be successful for you or not because< because this is a bullish strategy the because this is a bullish strategy the market< market needs to keep going up if the market needs to keep going up if the market< market crashes no matter how many levels market crashes no matter how many levels you< you have using criteria one using the you have using criteria one using the vertical< vertical divers ification it goes to vertical divers ification it goes to zero< zero you are going to lose everything zero you are going to lose everything that< that you have right so proven underlying that you have right so proven underlying is< is going to be very important when doing is going to be very important when doing this< this wheel strategy so what exactly is this wheel strategy so what exactly is proven< proven underline well basically it's proven underline well basically it's fundamentally< fundamentally good stocks that have fundamentally good stocks that have increasing< increasing revenue and profits that is increasing revenue and profits that is the< the very first point so I want you to the very first point so I want you to take< take a look at these two income sheets take a look at these two income sheets down< down here these two income statement the down here these two income statement the one< one at the top you can see that the one at the top you can see that the revenue< revenue in blue and the net income in revenue in blue and the net income in yellow< yellow as you can see it's pretty yellow as you can see it's pretty erratic< erratic right the revenue is going down erratic right the revenue is going down going< going up going down and the worst thing going up going down and the worst thing is< is that your net income as you can see is that your net income as you can see it's< it's all in a loss so if you take a look it's all in a loss so if you take a look at< at this kind of stock although it may at this kind of stock although it may have< have very high implied volatility is have very high implied volatility is this< this the kind of stock that you want to this the kind of stock that you want to get< get into for the real strategy right get into for the real strategy right because< because if the company is not profitable because if the company is not profitable then< then chances are the stock price is not then chances are the stock price is not going< going to be that good right because the going to be that good right because the uh< uh income statement or rather you know uh income statement or rather you know the< the net income profit and loss whether the net income profit and loss whether it's< it's making money or not it's going to it's making money or not it's going to be< be reflected most of the time in the be reflected most of the time in the stock< stock price right so let's take a look stock price right so let's take a look at< at the next one so this one as you can at the next one so this one as you can see< see down here so much better right you see down here so much better right you can< can see the revenue is increasing the can see the revenue is increasing the net< net income is also pretty much net income is also pretty much increasing< increasing year on year and it has been increasing year on year and it has been profitable< profitable for the past 5 years right so profitable for the past 5 years right so these< these are some things that you want to these are some things that you want to take< take note of so when it comes to take note of so when it comes to fundamentally< fundamentally good stock stocks there fundamentally good stock stocks there are< are quite a number of criteria right for are quite a number of criteria right for example< example you might want to look for example you might want to look for stocks< stocks that have good mode as well so on stocks that have good mode as well so on and< and so forth right so generally just as and so forth right so generally just as a< a snapshot I like to look for increasing a snapshot I like to look for increasing revenue< revenue and income and that it has been revenue and income and that it has been profitable< profitable at least for the past 5 to 10 profitable at least for the past 5 to 10 years< years so you know that the company is at years so you know that the company is at least< least going to be around and it at least least going to be around and it at least have< have a track record that it's making have a track record that it's making money< money right because remember all the money right because remember all the stocks< stocks that you're trading are all stocks that you're trading are all actually< actually companies right and if the the actually companies right and if the the company< company has been losing for many years company has been losing for many years in< in a row well there's always some chance in a row well there's always some chance that< that it's going to go bankrupt and shut that it's going to go bankrupt and shut down< down right if it shut down then your down right if it shut down then your everything< everything they put into the stock right everything they put into the stock right just< just goes to zero now the next point is just goes to zero now the next point is that< that it has to be have been around for that it has to be have been around for at< at least more than a decade and the at least more than a decade and the longer< longer the better right if you want to longer the better right if you want to put< put into stocks that you know have just put into stocks that you know have just IPO< IPO recently that it's going to be so IPO recently that it's going to be so risky< risky because you have no idea whether risky because you have no idea whether this< this company is going to survive or not this company is going to survive or not right< right because you know a company going right because you know a company going IPO< IPO doesn't mean it's going to stay IPO doesn't mean it's going to stay there< there forever you've seen many stocks there forever you've seen many stocks that< that have just gone bankrupt after you that have just gone bankrupt after you know< know going public right so that is why know going public right so that is why if< if a stock has been around for at least if a stock has been around for at least 10< 10 years or longer then you know that 10 years or longer then you know that this< this company is pretty solid so that is this company is pretty solid so that is the< the next thing you really want to look the next thing you really want to look out< out for or if you're not good at out for or if you're not good at selecting< selecting stocks then the simple way selecting stocks then the simple way would< would be to go for broad-based equities would be to go for broad-based equities index< index ETFs right so they are Co a number index ETFs right so they are Co a number but< but the thing is that most of them are but the thing is that most of them are pretty< pretty expensive right for example spy pretty expensive right for example spy QQQ< QQQ iwm and all this index ETFs right QQQ iwm and all this index ETFs right there< there are of course Alternatives you can there are of course Alternatives you can go< go for the cheaper ones like for example go for the cheaper ones like for example xlk< xlk the tech stock is slightly cheaper xlk the tech stock is slightly cheaper than< than QQQ you have also you know XLF than QQQ you have also you know XLF which< which is the financial index ETF and which is the financial index ETF and right< right so this is something that you do right so this is something that you do want< want to look out for so the trade-off is want to look out for so the trade-off is that< that index ETFs broad-based equities that index ETFs broad-based equities once< once they tend to be slightly safer to once they tend to be slightly safer to do< do the wheel but you know you're not do the wheel but you know you're not going< going to have that much premium right so going to have that much premium right so maybe< maybe the trade off for that the maybe the trade off for that the strategy< strategy would be to sell and add the strategy would be to sell and add the money< money option so that you'll be able to money option so that you'll be able to get< get slightly more premium than if you get slightly more premium than if you sell< sell out the money right but I'm not go sell out the money right but I'm not go in< in depth into how you want to sell that in depth into how you want to sell that right< right so uh I'm just going to talk about right so uh I'm just going to talk about how< how to make it a no loss whe strategy how to make it a no loss whe strategy and< and based on criteria two is to choose and based on criteria two is to choose the< the right underlying now let's get on to the right underlying now let's get on to criteria< criteria number three and that is to criteria number three and that is to have< have strong technical have strong technical right< right so if you have fundamentally good right so if you have fundamentally good stock< stock and you have you know implemented stock and you have you know implemented the< the vertical diversification still not the vertical diversification still not really< really enough because you also want to really enough because you also want to look< look at strong technicals so what is look at strong technicals so what is strong< strong technicals so strong technicals strong technicals so strong technicals basically< basically just means that you want to basically just means that you want to look< look at the chart and you want to go look at the chart and you want to go back< back you know at least a decade right so back you know at least a decade right so first< first off again you want to see that the first off again you want to see that the underly< underly has been around for at least a underly has been around for at least a decade< decade and that it has survived many decade and that it has survived many crashes< crashes and crashes by that I mean those crashes and crashes by that I mean those times< times like 2008 financial crisis uh times like 2008 financial crisis uh pandemic< pandemic 2020 uh 2022 the bare market pandemic 2020 uh 2022 the bare market and< and all the other you know times where and all the other you know times where there's< there's a crisis right maybe not having there's a crisis right maybe not having to< to do with the company like for example to do with the company like for example Wars< Wars going on uh Middle East Wars or Wars going on uh Middle East Wars or maybe< maybe you know trade War so all this you maybe you know trade War so all this you want< want to take a look at the chart to see want to take a look at the chart to see how< how the company has actually perform how the company has actually perform under< under those circumstances and whether under those circumstances and whether has< has it kept making new highs so again has it kept making new highs so again take< take a look. at these two stocks down take a look at these two stocks down here< here the first stock as you can see wow here the first stock as you can see wow this< this is just so irratic you have no idea this is just so irratic you have no idea what's< what's going on and then it comes down what's going on and then it comes down imagine< imagine you did your view strategy imagine you did your view strategy somewhere< somewhere around here well good luck to somewhere around here well good luck to you< you you're probably never going to see you you're probably never going to see your< your money again right most likely if your money again right most likely if this< this stock doesn't go to zero and if this stock doesn't go to zero and if it's< it's still not profitable you know you it's still not profitable you know you may< may have to pass this uh stock on to you may have to pass this uh stock on to you know< know your grand grand grandchildren for know your grand grand grandchildren for them< them to finally see if the stock goes them to finally see if the stock goes back< back up right otherwise other than that back up right otherwise other than that I< I don't think you're going to see your I don't think you're going to see your money< money in this lifetime right so you can money in this lifetime right so you can see< see the first chart down here is just see the first chart down here is just too< too erratic for you to do the view too erratic for you to do the view strategy< strategy now whereas the second chart as strategy now whereas the second chart as you< you can see the market just kept going you can see the market just kept going up< up and up and up despite all the crashes up and up and up despite all the crashes so< so as you can see down here 200 2008 so as you can see down here 200 2008 right< right somewhere down here this is the right somewhere down here this is the subprime< subprime crisis it looks like it's very subprime crisis it looks like it's very small< small compared to where the rest of the small compared to where the rest of the you< you know where it ended up in the future you know where it ended up in the future right< right but if you were to just zoom into right but if you were to just zoom into this< this period down here this crash is this period down here this crash is actually< actually pretty big actually pretty big right< right 2008 financial crisis many stocks right 2008 financial crisis many stocks just< just dropped like 50% right so this just dropped like 50% right so this probably< probably had a very large draw down but probably had a very large draw down but in< in the big scheme of things over a very in the big scheme of things over a very long< long time is so minuscule right same long time is so minuscule right same thing< thing somewhere around here I think this thing somewhere around here I think this was< was around the pandemic 2020 crash went was around the pandemic 2020 crash went up< up down here 2022 around here the market up down here 2022 around here the market you< you know went to Bare market and then you know went to Bare market and then now< now it's at all-time highs again so I now it's at all-time highs again so I know< know that this stock is pretty strong know that this stock is pretty strong and< and by the way it actually corresponds and by the way it actually corresponds to< to this income statement which I showed to this income statement which I showed you< you down here so the very first stock you down here so the very first stock which< which you saw is this one down here as which you saw is this one down here as you< you can see this have a very very lousy you can see this have a very very lousy income< income statement right the one at the income statement right the one at the bottom< bottom very good income statement and bottom very good income statement and again< again reflected in the stock so if again reflected in the stock so if you're< you're wondering what stock this is this you're wondering what stock this is this is< is gme GameStop or is it AMC one of them is gme GameStop or is it AMC one of them right< right and this one at the bottom is right and this one at the bottom is Google< Google right or alphabet the company Google right or alphabet the company right< right so as you can see it's very right so as you can see it's very important< important that when you're doing the important that when you're doing the wheel< wheel strategy that you need to choose wheel strategy that you need to choose the< the right underlying right that is the the right underlying right that is the Paramount< Paramount apart from you know having Paramount apart from you know having strategy< strategy in terms of the options so when strategy in terms of the options so when you< you have the three criteria combined you have the three criteria combined right< right criteria number one you have right criteria number one you have vertical< vertical diversification this is to vertical diversification this is to avoid< avoid you know having being right on the avoid you know having being right on the direction< direction the moment you put it on direction the moment you put it on because< because you may have criteria two and because you may have criteria two and three< three where they are good stocks but you three where they are good stocks but you may< may have the timing wrong right if you may have the timing wrong right if you had< had the timing wrong and you enter into had the timing wrong and you enter into the< the wheel strategy without any vertical the wheel strategy without any vertical diversification< diversification right at the top then diversification right at the top then you're< you're going to have to hold on to it you're going to have to hold on to it for< for quite some time right especially for for quite some time right especially for those< those people who went into you know those people who went into you know those< those stocks around you know the early those stocks around you know the early 2022< 2022 so because of that we want to 2022 so because of that we want to implement< implement this vertical diversification implement this vertical diversification so< so you don't really have to worry about so you don't really have to worry about timing< timing because if you have multiple timing because if you have multiple levels< levels as it goes down hey you're going levels as it goes down hey you're going to< to be happy right because you know that to be happy right because you know that if< if the uh underlying is going to go up if the uh underlying is going to go up in< in the long term then all those at the in the long term then all those at the bottom< bottom if you get assigned you're going bottom if you get assigned you're going to< to have very very good uh entry price to have very very good uh entry price right< right it's going to be so much lower and right it's going to be so much lower and much< much easier for you to again you know much easier for you to again you know get< get out of the position using the cover get out of the position using the cover call< call uh as per the real strategy so call uh as per the real strategy so criteria< criteria one vertical diversification criteria one vertical diversification criteria< criteria number two proven underlying criteria number two proven underlying right< right proven underlying again very right proven underlying again very important< important because if the company is not important because if the company is not profitable< profitable well sooner or later that profitable well sooner or later that stock< stock is going to go nowhere right or stock is going to go nowhere right or maybe< maybe even go bankrupt and finally maybe even go bankrupt and finally criteria< criteria number three strong technicals criteria number three strong technicals because< because there are certain stocks that because there are certain stocks that have< have proven underlying but the have proven underlying but the technicals< technicals may not be strong because of technicals may not be strong because of maybe< maybe certain country sentiment for maybe certain country sentiment for example< example if you were to go for stocks example if you were to go for stocks like< like Baba Baba does have pretty good uh like Baba Baba does have pretty good uh fundamentals< fundamentals as you know it is a fundamentals as you know it is a profitable< profitable company but because of the profitable company but because of the economic< economic situation in China well it's economic situation in China well it's not< not doing well right so those people who not doing well right so those people who have< have gotten into Baba for quite some have gotten into Baba for quite some time< time then and you probably still stuck time then and you probably still stuck so< so that is why you know looking at so that is why you know looking at criteria< criteria Tre is pretty important as well criteria Tre is pretty important as well you< you want to see the technicals that is you want to see the technicals that is pretty< pretty strong that is just kept going up pretty strong that is just kept going up right< right so when these three combine you right so when these three combine you should< should have you know pretty pretty good should have you know pretty pretty good results< results right so as you can see down results right so as you can see down here< here I've been doing the viel strategy here I've been doing the viel strategy more< more accurately the Inc conrete viel more accurately the Inc conrete viel strategy< strategy on some of the underlines right strategy on some of the underlines right like< like for example QQQ Amazon uh Google like for example QQQ Amazon uh Google and< and meta so some of these are pretty and meta so some of these are pretty expensive< expensive in fact all them are pretty expensive in fact all them are pretty expensive< expensive so you do need quite a bit of expensive so you do need quite a bit of capital< capital but there are some you know capital but there are some you know underlyings< underlyings that is much lower price as underlyings that is much lower price as well< well so again not a trade recommendation well so again not a trade recommendation for< for you to do any of this this is what I for you to do any of this this is what I have< have been doing and as you can see it have been doing and as you can see it has< has no loss so far right because I've has no loss so far right because I've stuck< stuck to this three criteria the market stuck to this three criteria the market has< has just kept going up right as long as has just kept going up right as long as the< the market just keep going up the the market just keep going up the underlying< underlying just keep making new highs underlying just keep making new highs then< then again this is the closest to a no then again this is the closest to a no loss< loss option strategy that you're going loss option strategy that you're going to< to get in the world of options by the to get in the world of options by the way< way if you like this video then you're way if you like this video then you're absolutely< absolutely going to love this next video absolutely going to love this next video which< which I have for you so go ahead and which I have for you so go ahead and watch< watch that video right now also if you

Language: en all< all right already so in today's video i all right already so in today's video i want< want to carry on the topic of the in the want to carry on the topic of the in the money< money covered call so if the stock is money covered call so if the stock is overbought< overbought should you be selling an out overbought should you be selling an out of< of the money or an in the money covered of the money or an in the money covered call< call right which is better call right which is better so< so in the previous video i talked about so in the previous video i talked about you< you know you buy a hundred shares at the you know you buy a hundred shares at the market< market and then you sell in the money market and then you sell in the money cover< cover call and also an out the money cover call and also an out the money cover< cover call and we compare the both of cover call and we compare the both of them< them right to see which is better is it them right to see which is better is it a< a good strategy or is it a bad mistake a good strategy or is it a bad mistake so< so if you haven't watched that yet so if you haven't watched that yet please< please go ahead and watch that first please go ahead and watch that first i'll< i'll put the link at the top right hand i'll put the link at the top right hand corner< corner of this video corner of this video but< but for this video i want to talk about but for this video i want to talk about what< what if you had already bought the what if you had already bought the hundred< hundred shares right and then you held hundred shares right and then you held on< on to it right so you had around to it on to it right so you had around to it until< until the stochastics indicator is until the stochastics indicator is showing< showing an overbought signal right so showing an overbought signal right so when< when the stochastics is showing an when the stochastics is showing an overbought< overbought signal it just means that overbought signal it just means that there< there is a higher chance a likelier there is a higher chance a likelier chance< chance that the market will go down chance that the market will go down compared< compared to it going up right now of compared to it going up right now of course< course it is not guaranteed that the course it is not guaranteed that the market< market will immediately go back down market will immediately go back down after< after issuing an overbought it just is a after issuing an overbought it just is a probability< probability thing it's a measure to say probability thing it's a measure to say that< that the market has a higher chance of that the market has a higher chance of it< it probably turning down compared to it it probably turning down compared to it continue< continue to go up now if you see the continue to go up now if you see the previous previous previous times< times when the market was showing an times when the market was showing an overbought< overbought signal you can see that it overbought signal you can see that it has< has been overbought for quite some time has been overbought for quite some time the< the market just kept going up right the market just kept going up right so so so uh< uh in this video we want to compare uh in this video we want to compare which< which is better right do you want to which is better right do you want to sell< sell an out of the money cover call or sell an out of the money cover call or do< do you want to sell an in the money do you want to sell an in the money cover< cover call when the stochastics or any cover call when the stochastics or any uh< uh indicator that you're using the uh indicator that you're using the show's< show's overbought oversold right so if show's overbought oversold right so if any< any of this indicator is showing any of this indicator is showing overbought< overbought should be selling an overbought should be selling an out-of-money< out-of-money cover call or an in the out-of-money cover call or an in the money< money cover call right which is better money cover call right which is better so< so if you have watched the cover call so if you have watched the cover call blueprint< blueprint on the strike selection which blueprint on the strike selection which i< i talked about previously in my channel i talked about previously in my channel you< you haven't watched that again please go you haven't watched that again please go ahead< ahead watch that first what i mentioned ahead watch that first what i mentioned then< then is that if you want to avoid your then is that if you want to avoid your cover< cover call from getting assigned then cover call from getting assigned then you< you want to sell your out of money cover you want to sell your out of money cover call< call right of course it is not call right of course it is not guaranteed< guaranteed that you won't get assigned guaranteed that you won't get assigned it's< it's just that you will have a less it's just that you will have a less likely< likely a chance to get a sign likely a chance to get a sign right< right for the market to go up above your right for the market to go up above your out< out of the money cover call and expire out of the money cover call and expire there< there there's a less likelier chance there there's a less likelier chance compared< compared to if you see the indicator compared to if you see the indicator right< right the stochastics is oversold and right the stochastics is oversold and then< then you sell the cover call right so then you sell the cover call right so for< for this video for this video should< should we be selling out the money cover should we be selling out the money cover call< call or should we be selling an in the call or should we be selling an in the money< money cover call which is better when money cover call which is better when the< the stochastics is overbought so the the stochastics is overbought so the question question question i< i want to put to you is what is your i want to put to you is what is your primary< primary objective to hold the stock long primary objective to hold the stock long term< term right because this is the most term right because this is the most important< important thing you want to understand important thing you want to understand because because because some< some people get into this cover call some people get into this cover call positions positions positions uh< uh the reason which you're getting into uh the reason which you're getting into this< this position could be very different this position could be very different from< from somebody else so for me. personally from somebody else so for me personally when< when i get into a position like this when i get into a position like this most< most of the time what i want to do is most of the time what i want to do is basically< basically just hold on to this hundred basically just hold on to this hundred shares< shares for a very long time right the shares for a very long time right the idea< idea is that i do not want to have my idea is that i do not want to have my covered< covered call assigned i do not want to covered call assigned i do not want to have< have my shares called away so that is have my shares called away so that is why< why i'm very selective when i sell my why i'm very selective when i sell my cover< cover call i do not sell it all the time cover call i do not sell it all the time most< most of the time i just wait for it to most of the time i just wait for it to be< be overbought and sell it out of the be overbought and sell it out of the money< money cover call now what if that is not money cover call now what if that is not your< your primary objective what is your your primary objective what is your objective< objective is just to sell the cover call objective is just to sell the cover call to< to get an income right so to get an income right so if< if your primary objective to hold the if your primary objective to hold the stock< stock is for the long term that means stock is for the long term that means you< you want to hold it for a very long term you want to hold it for a very long term without< without having it caught away you want without having it caught away you want this< this to be a long term this to be a long term investment< investment stock portfolio then i would investment stock portfolio then i would say< say that yes you want to sell the out of say that yes you want to sell the out of money< money cover call right the pros is that money cover call right the pros is that you< you have a lower chance of having your you have a lower chance of having your stock< stock called away and you still get an stock called away and you still get an income< income on the cover call right so the income on the cover call right so the main< main driver main driver for< for you if you are planning to sell an for you if you are planning to sell an out< out of the money cover call is the out of the money cover call is the capital< capital gains on this 100 shares right capital gains on this 100 shares right so< so this cover call uh premium which you so this cover call uh premium which you receive< receive is just additional but your main receive is just additional but your main driver< driver of profits is this capital gain driver of profits is this capital gain from< from your 100 shares of stock so if that from your 100 shares of stock so if that is< is your is your motivation< motivation for buying the hundred shares motivation for buying the hundred shares then< then you want to sell an automatic cover then you want to sell an automatic cover call< call so this is the pros now the cons is call so this is the pros now the cons is that< that if the market tanks right you do that if the market tanks right you do not< not have that big of a cushion to the not have that big of a cushion to the downside< downside compared to the in the money downside compared to the in the money cover< cover call so if you sell an in the cover call so if you sell an in the money< money cover call money cover call all< all right let's say for example you sell all right let's say for example you sell it< it somewhere here in the money cover it somewhere here in the money cover call< call and the market goes down right in call and the market goes down right in both< both cases both cases your< your cover call is not assigned that your cover call is not assigned that means< means you'll still get to keep your means you'll still get to keep your shares< shares but you would have been better shares but you would have been better off< off if you sold the in the money covered off if you sold the in the money covered call< call at this point right because call at this point right because you< you would have a higher premium a higher you would have a higher premium a higher premium< premium will help you cushion the premium will help you cushion the downfall downfall downfall maybe< maybe it's temporary if you bought a maybe it's temporary if you bought a good< good stock or maybe you bought an index good stock or maybe you bought an index etf< etf right it can go up in the long term etf right it can go up in the long term so< so if that's the case you'll be getting so if that's the case you'll be getting a< a a bigger premium to help cushion this a a bigger premium to help cushion this temporarily< temporarily uh temporary draw down temporarily uh temporary draw down now< now what if your objective is not to now what if your objective is not to hold< hold the stock long term your objective hold the stock long term your objective is< is to just get the covered call is to just get the covered call income< income the premium from it and just keep income the premium from it and just keep doing< doing this over and over again just to doing this over and over again just to rinse< rinse and repeat so if that's the case rinse and repeat so if that's the case then< then yes go ahead to sell the in the then yes go ahead to sell the in the money< money cover call right so the pros of money cover call right so the pros of this< this is that you get to secure your this is that you get to secure your intrinsic< intrinsic value gain at the current intrinsic value gain at the current price< price if the stock is above the in the price if the stock is above the in the money< money cover call at expiration and you money cover call at expiration and you have< have a big credit to cushion if the have a big credit to cushion if the stock< stock is below your in the money cover stock is below your in the money cover call< call expiration so basically when you call expiration so basically when you sell< sell the in the money cover call at this sell the in the money cover call at this point< point of time point of time all< all you're actually doing is also all you're actually doing is also securing< securing this exit price down here at securing this exit price down here at 89. 07< 89.

07 because as i alluded to in the 89. 07 because as i alluded to in the previous< previous video and if you look at the previous video and if you look at the option< option chain when you sell this in the option chain when you sell this in the money< money cover call you'll notice that the money cover call you'll notice that the intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value portion< portion the column of this cover call it portion the column of this cover call it would< would be the difference between this would be the difference between this current< current price and your strike price current price and your strike price which< which means to say that when you sell which means to say that when you sell the< the in the money cover call you really the in the money cover call you really have< have the embedded uh difference of this have the embedded uh difference of this intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value from< from this point to this point which from this point to this point which means< means to say you won't actually lose any means to say you won't actually lose any intrinsic< intrinsic value all you'll be getting is intrinsic value all you'll be getting is this< this extrinsic value from this cover this extrinsic value from this cover call< call so what you're essentially trying call so what you're essentially trying to< to do is that you want to get the to do is that you want to get the extrinsic< extrinsic value from this in the money extrinsic value from this in the money. cover< cover call at the same time you want to cover call at the same time you want to ensure< ensure that there is a ensure that there is a higher< higher chance that the market or rather higher chance that the market or rather that< that your cover call will get assigned that your cover call will get assigned because< because if the market was to go because if the market was to go somewhere< somewhere down here at somewhere down here at expiration< expiration above you're in the money expiration above you're in the money cover< cover call if you had sold the out the cover call if you had sold the out the money< money cover call right your this out of money cover call right your this out of the< the money cover call will not be the money cover call will not be exercised< exercised right your shares will not be exercised right your shares will not be caught< caught away but in this case your shares caught away but in this case your shares will< will be cut away will be cut away and< and then you'll be still getting the and then you'll be still getting the intrinsic< intrinsic value difference from this intrinsic value difference from this point< point to this point because you're in point to this point because you're in the< the money cover call already has that the money cover call already has that intrinsic< intrinsic value embedded into it so it's intrinsic value embedded into it so it's essentially< essentially you selling off at 89.

07 essentially you selling off at 89. 07 and< and then still getting the additional and then still getting the additional extrinsic< extrinsic value so at this point of time extrinsic value so at this point of time you< you have no position you have no position you< you can go on and put on another cover you can go on and put on another cover call< call position again right or maybe you call position again right or maybe you can< can just buy a shares wait for the stock can just buy a shares wait for the stock to< to go back up and then you sell another to go back up and then you sell another in< in the money cover call so in this case in the money cover call so in this case if< if you just want to go for the income if you just want to go for the income you< you want to be in and out you have no you want to be in and out you have no desire< desire to hold on to the stock for the desire to hold on to the stock for the long< long term then yes selling the in the long term then yes selling the in the money< money cover call would be actually very money cover call would be actually very good< good now the cons is that the stock good now the cons is that the stock could< could continue going up and you miss out could continue going up and you miss out on< on more intrinsic value gains and the on more intrinsic value gains and the stock< stock may not come back down again so stock may not come back down again so for< for example if you had done the in the for example if you had done the in the money< money cover call at this point of time money cover call at this point of time let's< let's say you can see that the let's say you can see that the stochastics< stochastics is overbought at this point stochastics is overbought at this point in< in time and then you sort in the money in time and then you sort in the money cover< cover call let's say somewhere down here cover call let's say somewhere down here now< now as you can see the market has just now as you can see the market has just rallied< rallied from that point on had you sold rallied from that point on had you sold an< an out of the money cover call let's say an out of the money cover call let's say somewhere< somewhere down here you still would get somewhere down here you still would get exercise< exercise but you would have the exercise but you would have the difference< difference of this intrinsic value game difference of this intrinsic value game from< from here to here so you basically from here to here so you basically missed< missed out on this uh intrinsic value missed out on this uh intrinsic value gain< gain over here gain over here so< so this is where you want to weigh the so this is where you want to weigh the pros< pros and cons now there's no one that is pros and cons now there's no one that is better< better it all comes down to what the better it all comes down to what the market< market does after you have placed the market does after you have placed the cover< cover call or cover call or you< you know whether you are good at timing you know whether you are good at timing the< the market if you're good at timing the the market if you're good at timing the market< market then of course you can place your market then of course you can place your cover< cover call where you think the market cover call where you think the market will< will be hated now but davis can i just will be hated now but davis can i just sell< sell the in the money cover call and get sell the in the money cover call and get my< my shares called away and buy the shares my shares called away and buy the shares again< again once the stock goes lower so that again once the stock goes lower so that means< means your intention is to sell this in means your intention is to sell this in the< the money cover call the money cover call and< and then maybe you think that because it and then maybe you think that because it is< is overbought the market could come down is overbought the market could come down but< but not as low as your in the money but not as low as your in the money cover< cover call you won't go below you in the cover call you won't go below you in the money< money cover call so this way you get money cover call so this way you get exercised< exercised and then you still secure this exercised and then you still secure this intrinsic< intrinsic value game the exit at this intrinsic value game the exit at this price< price and it will be better than if you price and it will be better than if you sold< sold the other money cover call right so sold the other money cover call right so at< at this point of time you're waiting for at this point of time you're waiting for the< the stock after your shares have been the stock after your shares have been called< called away if the stock goes down again called away if the stock goes down again maybe< maybe to the original entry price then maybe to the original entry price then you< you want to buy again so is this a good you want to buy again so is this a good strategy< strategy now of course you can right strategy now of course you can right absolutely< absolutely you can that is if the stock absolutely you can that is if the stock goes< goes low enough to where you want to buy goes low enough to where you want to buy the< the stock again because what if you are the stock again because what if you are assigned assigned assigned your< your cover costs may assign your shares your cover costs may assign your shares has< has been cut away and from this point has been cut away and from this point the< the stock actually goes up so where are the stock actually goes up so where are you< you going to enter the stock are you you going to enter the stock are you going< going to buy at a higher point are you going to buy at a higher point are you going< going to buy immediately once your going to buy immediately once your shares< shares get caught away so these are the shares get caught away so these are the decisions< decisions that you have to make so again decisions that you have to make so again of< of course it would be fantastic if the of course it would be fantastic if the stock< stock immediately drops after you had stock immediately drops after you had your< your shares called away and then it goes your shares called away and then it goes back< back to the original entry price you buy back to the original entry price you buy again< again and do this again and just keep again and do this again and just keep making< making the money this way right making the money this way right now< now next thing you want to keep in mind now next thing you want to keep in mind is< is that remember that overbought is just is that remember that overbought is just an< an indication it can continue to be more an indication it can continue to be more overbought< overbought as the stock continues to go overbought as the stock continues to go up< up as you can see down here okay up as you can see down here okay so< so if you prioritize income then you can so if you prioritize income then you can go< go with the in the money cover call go with the in the money cover call right< right so all you're doing is you want to right so all you're doing is you want to have< have a high chance of having your shares have a high chance of having your shares called< called away so that you get the called away so that you get the extrinsic< extrinsic value and then you do this extrinsic value and then you do this position< position again but if you prioritize position again but if you prioritize capital< capital gains or you prioritize you know capital gains or you prioritize you know wanting< wanting to hold on to the stock for the wanting to hold on to the stock for the long< long term then you want to go for the long term then you want to go for the out< out of the money cover call now the out of the money cover call now the alternative< alternative is to sell and add the money alternative is to sell and add the money cover< cover call that means at this current cover call that means at this current price< price what you want to do is you sell price what you want to do is you sell the< the cover call at this price as well the cover call at this price as well so< so you'll be selling the cover call so you'll be selling the cover call exactly< exactly at the same price where the exactly at the same price where the market< market is and for this if the market market is and for this if the market goes< goes up goes up right< right you will be called away which is right you will be called away which is what< what you wanted if you wanted the income what you wanted if you wanted the income but< but this way you get actually more but this way you get actually more extrinsic< extrinsic value but if the stock extrinsic value but if the stock actually< actually goes down at least you still actually goes down at least you still have< have a bigger credit to cushion this have a bigger credit to cushion this downfall< downfall compared to if you sow the out downfall compared to if you sow the out of< of the money covered call up here right of the money covered call up here right now< now of course it may not be as good as now of course it may not be as good as the< the in the money cover call but then the in the money cover call but then again< again who knows where the market will go again who knows where the market will go right< right so it ultimately comes down to you right so it ultimately comes down to you know< know whether you're able to time the know whether you're able to time the market< market well or you know market well or you know or< or you have an intuition on where the or you have an intuition on where the market< market is going to go market is going to go so< so david since the stock is overbought so david since the stock is overbought and< and it has a higher chance of it going and it has a higher chance of it going down< down can i sell is slightly in the money down can i sell is slightly in the money cover< cover call using the weekly expiration cover call using the weekly expiration cycle< cycle so there's a higher chance of it cycle so there's a higher chance of it expiring< expiring below in the money cover call expiring below in the money cover call and< and i get a big credit and still get to and i get a big credit and still get to keep< keep my shares keep my shares well< well that's a mouthful so well that's a mouthful so i< i think what your idea here is that if i think what your idea here is that if the< the stock is it goes below you're in the the stock is it goes below you're in the money< money cover call money cover call right right right you'll< you'll still be able to get the huge you'll still be able to get the huge credit< credit down here and because you're credit down here and because you're selling< selling the weekly expiration cycle that selling the weekly expiration cycle that means< means probably around seven days or so means probably around seven days or so or< or less or less you< you know for you know for a< a higher chance there's a higher a higher chance there's a higher probability< probability because the market now is probability because the market now is overbought< overbought that the market will come overbought that the market will come down< down in the short term down in the short term rather< rather than you sell it maybe 30 days or rather than you sell it maybe 30 days or 45< 45 days in the money uh in the money 45 days in the money uh in the money cover< cover call the money cover call where cover call the money cover call where the< the market may bounce back up the market may bounce back up right right right sometime< sometime within the 45 or 30 days so sometime within the 45 or 30 days so what< what you're trying to do is trying to what you're trying to do is trying to capture< capture this move down here capture this move down here that< that you want to get this premium down that you want to get this premium down here< here because you think that the market here because you think that the market is< is going to go down so i do think that is going to go down so i do think that this< this is actually a pretty good strategy this is actually a pretty good strategy a< a very good idea if you can really time a very good idea if you can really time the< the market well because what you're the market well because what you're trying< trying to say here is that you're trying to say here is that you're predicting< predicting the market will definitely go predicting the market will definitely go below< below this in the money cover call so below this in the money cover call so you< you earn the income here and you still you earn the income here and you still get< get to keep your shares now of course if get to keep your shares now of course if it< it does that then yes but again you need it does that then yes but again you need to< to remember to remember that< that there's a higher chance right with that there's a higher chance right with the< the in the money cover calls that you the in the money cover calls that you will< will have your shares caught away will have your shares caught away compared< compared to all the money cover calls so compared to all the money cover calls so if< if you're prepared that there's a if you're prepared that there's a possibility< possibility of your shares being called possibility of your shares being called away< away then this would be a good idea so away then. this would be a good idea so for< for example what if the stock didn't go for example what if the stock didn't go down< down you see it's overbought like for down you see it's overbought like for example< example all these times down here it is example all these times down here it is overbought< overbought the market kept going up so overbought the market kept going up so there's< there's a possibility that what if it there's a possibility that what if it didn't< didn't go down you you had this idea to didn't go down you you had this idea to just< just capture more just capture more uh< uh premium for the in the money covered uh premium for the in the money covered call< call hoping that the market will go call hoping that the market will go below< below this point of time expire below this point of time expire worthless< worthless you still keep your shares but worthless you still keep your shares but what< what if the market continues to go up what if the market continues to go up so< so if the market went up uh what will so if the market went up uh what will happen< happen is that you will be caught away happen is that you will be caught away at< at this price and then the next question at this price and then the next question you're< you're going to ask yourself is how are you're going to ask yourself is how are you< you going to go back in right if you you going to go back in right if you still< still want to stop so maybe that time still want to stop so maybe that time you< you may have to wait for a retracement you may have to wait for a retracement or< or you just buy as it goes higher right or you just buy as it goes higher right so< so all these other questions you want to so all these other questions you want to ask< ask yourself against there's always a ask yourself against there's always a trade-off trade-off trade-off now< now dave is for out of the money cover now dave is for out of the money cover calls< calls you mentioned about selling 30 to calls you mentioned about selling 30 to 45< 45 days out yes that's right if you 45 days out yes that's right if you watch< watch my cover call strike selection watch my cover call strike selection blueprint< blueprint i talked about selling the blueprint i talked about selling the cover< cover call you know 30 to 45 days out cover call you know 30 to 45 days out now< now what about selling the weekly now what about selling the weekly expiration< expiration cycles is it a good idea so expiration cycles is it a good idea so my< my personal opinion is that yes selling my personal opinion is that yes selling the< the cover call in the weekly expiration the cover call in the weekly expiration cycle< cycle is definitely feasible and you can cycle is definitely feasible and you can get< get actually a higher return on the call get actually a higher return on the call option option option so< so when i talk about higher return on so when i talk about higher return on the< the call option the call option i< i just specifically mean the cover call i just specifically mean the cover call premium< premium right so remember when you're premium right so remember when you're selling< selling the cover call or rather the selling the cover call or rather the cover< cover call position cover call position consists< consists of the 100 shares consists of the 100 shares plus< plus the cover call this is what you plus the cover call this is what you call< call a cover call position if you do not call a cover call position if you do not have< have this hundred shares all you have is have this hundred shares all you have is a< a naked call so it's a totally different a naked call so it's a totally different position< position so a cover call position position so a cover call position consists< consists of the intrinsic value gain the consists of the intrinsic value gain the potential< potential intrinsic value gain from the potential intrinsic value gain from the 100< 100 shares so i do think that the 100 shares so i do think that the weekly< weekly expiration cycle is definitely weekly expiration cycle is definitely feasible< feasible if all you're trying to do is feasible if all you're trying to do is get< get a high income from the cover call get a high income from the cover call and< and you're not interested or rather the and you're not interested or rather the main< main driver of this profits is just the main driver of this profits is just the covered< covered call premium instead of your 100 covered call premium instead of your 100 shares< shares intrinsic value gain so if that's shares intrinsic value gain so if that's the< the case yes you can definitely sell the the case yes you can definitely sell the weekly< weekly cover calls and in fact that's weekly cover calls and in fact that's what< what i do for the wheel strategy where i what i do for the wheel strategy where i have< have multiple entry levels so for have multiple entry levels so for example< example i use the wheel strategy example i use the wheel strategy in< in a slightly different fashion than in a slightly different fashion than what< what most people do especially now what most people do especially now because< because it's in a bear market the market because it's in a bear market the market tends< tends to you know want to go down over tends to you know want to go down over time< time so most people would just have one time so most people would just have one entry< entry level and then after they've entry level and then after they've entered< entered it they either sell the cover entered it they either sell the cover call< call at the entry price or they finally call at the entry price or they finally wait< wait for the stock to go back up before wait for the stock to go back up before selling< selling you know the cover call but for selling you know the cover call but for me< me i like to me i like to prepare<

happen so for example if< if i want to get into this starbucks and if i want to get into this starbucks and i< i think that the market is going to go i think that the market is going to go pretty< pretty far down what i'll do is that pretty far down what i'll do is that i'll< i'll split them into different levels i'll split them into different levels right< right i will sell cash secure put at right i will sell cash secure put at many< many different levels of course i've many different levels of course i've already< already allocated my capital right i've already allocated my capital right i've got< got a pretty decent sized capital got a pretty decent sized capital so< so that is why i'm able to enter into so that is why i'm able to enter into many< many different levels so what i'll do is many different levels so what i'll do is that< that as each time it comes down to the that as each time it comes down to the level< level i will sell the weekly level i will sell the weekly cash< cash output so that i get a higher cash output so that i get a higher return< return on the cash output itself on the return on the cash output itself on the premium< premium so as it goes down i get 100 premium so as it goes down i get 100 shares shares shares right< right i will wait for it to go back up right i will wait for it to go back up and< and then i'll sell the weekly covered and then i'll sell the weekly covered call< call again so because call again so because the< the levels in between each of this the the levels in between each of this the interval< interval level interval level is< is is quite close to each other i do not is is quite close to each other i do not need< need to need to sell< sell the 30 to 45 days out right sell the 30 to 45 days out right generally< generally i want to sell the 30 45 days generally i want to sell the 30 45 days out< out if you know i want to get a further out if you know i want to get a further away< away strike price right so for example away strike price right so for example let< let me just remove all this drawing so let me just remove all this drawing so let's< let's say for example the price is down let's say for example the price is down here< here right now here right now i< i want to sell the 84 i want to sell the 84 strike< strike price now if i were to go to the strike price now if i were to go to the weekly< weekly i wouldn't be able to sell this weekly i wouldn't be able to sell this for< for much premium because it's just too for much premium because it's just too far< far out of the money for the weekly far out of the money for the weekly right< right but if i would go to the 30 to 45 right but if i would go to the 30 to 45 days< days the monthly cycle then this 84 days the monthly cycle then this 84 would< would have a decent premium for me to would have a decent premium for me to sell< sell so if i'm only going for one or two sell so if i'm only going for one or two or< or maybe at most three levels where i or maybe at most three levels where i space< space them out right pretty far apart space them out right pretty far apart maybe< maybe i can go up to five percent maybe i can go up to five percent or< or more or maybe to 10 again depending or more or maybe to 10 again depending on< on the individual stocks if that's the on the individual stocks if that's the case< case then i would go for the monthly uh case then i would go for the monthly uh cycle< cycle right but if it's very close cycle right but if it's very close distance< distance which i have in between them distance which i have in between them i'll< i'll go for the weekly so the same thing i'll go for the weekly so the same thing for< for the cover call right so you for the cover call right so you definitely< definitely can go for the covered call definitely can go for the covered call weeklies< weeklies but keep in mind that while the weeklies but keep in mind that while the return< return is higher return is higher right< right your absolute right your absolute amount< amount which you receive is going to be amount which you receive is going to be lesser< lesser in terms of the numeric amount lesser in terms of the numeric amount right< right and also the strikes are closer to right and also the strikes are closer to the< the current price that means your the current price that means your intrinsic< intrinsic value gain will be lesser if intrinsic value gain will be lesser if the< the stock is above your cover card the stock is above your cover card expiration< expiration so for example if you let's expiration so for example if you let's say< say you're targeting a dollar in terms say you're targeting a dollar in terms of< of premium for the weekly you may just of premium for the weekly you may just get< get somewhere down here right probably get somewhere down here right probably close< close to this current price but if you close to this current price but if you look< look at the monthly if you get a dollar look at the monthly if you get a dollar premium premium premium right< right you may be able to sell somewhere right you may be able to sell somewhere ninety< ninety six dollars much further out of ninety six dollars much further out of the< the money right now you might be saying the money right now you might be saying that< that the one dollar is is too little in that the one dollar is is too little in terms< terms of premium why do i want to sell terms of premium why do i want to sell you< you know one dollar only or so far then you know one dollar only or so far then as< as i mentioned remember the cover call as i mentioned remember the cover call position< position is consisting of this long 100 position is consisting of this long 100

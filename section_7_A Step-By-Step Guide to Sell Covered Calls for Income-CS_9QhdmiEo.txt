Language: en hi< hi guys davis here so in this video i'm hi guys davis here so in this video i'm going< going to give you a step-by-step guide going to give you a step-by-step guide to< to selling cover calls so what we're to selling cover calls so what we're going< going to do is first i'm going to just going to do is first i'm going to just share< share with you what is a cover call share with you what is a cover call why< why you want to sell a cover call and why you want to sell a cover call and how< how you're going to sell it and then how you're going to sell it and then we'll< we'll head over to the td ameritrade we'll head over to the td ameritrade platform platform platform and< and i'll show you some of the cover and i'll show you some of the cover calls< calls that i've sold calls that i've sold i< i love cover calls a lot and i'll also i love cover calls a lot and i'll also show< show you how you can start placing your show you how you can start placing your cover< cover call as well cover call as well all< all right so first of all what is a all right so first of all what is a cover< cover call cover call so< so basically a cover call is selling a so basically a cover call is selling a call< call option against either 100 shares of call option against either 100 shares of stock< stock or a long call option if you were stock or a long call option if you were to< to sell it against a long call option to sell it against a long call option this< this would be what you call either this would be what you call either diagonal< diagonal spread or. some people call it a diagonal spread or some people call it a poor< poor man's covered call so poor man's covered call so when< when you sell a call option against uh when you sell a call option against uh your< your position you want to always ensure your position you want to always ensure that< that you have 100 shares of stock if you that you have 100 shares of stock if you do< do not have 100 shares of stock or at do not have 100 shares of stock or at least< least a call option you're going to have least a call option you're going to have a< a naked call and this is a very a naked call and this is a very dangerous< dangerous position to be in especially dangerous position to be in especially if< if you don't know what you're doing so if you don't know what you're doing so always< always ensure that you have 100 shares always ensure that you have 100 shares of< of stock first all right of stock first all right so< so with a cover call basically what so with a cover call basically what you're< you're doing is you're selling the right you're doing is you're selling the right to< to buy the underlying stock at the to buy the underlying stock at the strike< strike price strike price so< so as the seller you have the obligation so as the seller you have the obligation to< to sell the underlying stock at the to sell the underlying stock at the strike< strike price that you've chosen so strike price that you've chosen so here's< here's an example so let's say you have here's an example so let's say you have bought< bought ibm bought ibm already< already you have 100 shares of ibm the already you have 100 shares of ibm the current< current price is 137. 50 current price is 137.

50 now< now you sold a covered call at the now you sold a covered call at the strike< strike price of 142 with a dte of 30 strike price of 142 with a dte of 30 which< which just means there's 30 days to the which just means there's 30 days to the expiration< expiration of this cover call and you expiration of this cover call and you collected< collected a premium of two dollars four collected a premium of two dollars four cents< cents and because there's a hundred cents and because there's a hundred shares< shares for every option contract so shares for every option contract so you're< you're actually collecting two hundred you're actually collecting two hundred and< and four dollars right so it's two and four dollars right so it's two dollars< dollars four seven times a hundred dollars four seven times a hundred so< so at expiration there's only two things so at expiration there's only two things that< that can happen that can happen right< right if at expiration right if at expiration if< if ibm is above 142 dollars if ibm is above 142 dollars you< you are obligated to sell your ibm you are obligated to sell your ibm shares< shares 142 shares 142 so< so what if your stock shoots all the way so what if your stock shoots all the way up< up to 200 or 300 dollars well you have up to 200 or 300 dollars well you have to< to sell at 142 steel so this is the to sell at 142 steel so this is the option< option contract which you have uh did option contract which you have uh did with< with the buyer of your cover call right with the buyer of your cover call right and< and if ibm is below 142 dollars at and if ibm is below 142 dollars at expiration< expiration well you get to keep your expiration well you get to keep your shares< shares and you get to keep your premium shares and you get to keep your premium as< as well so it's very simple and it's as well so it's very simple and it's very< very straightforward so very straightforward so why< why do you want to sell cover calls so why do you want to sell cover calls so there< there are basically three reasons that i there are basically three reasons that i can< can think of so number one is that you can think of so number one is that you get< get consistent income so if you can keep get consistent income so if you can keep selling< selling a covered call every 30 to 40 selling a covered call every 30 to 40 days< days to expiration cycle days to expiration cycle where< where you're going to keep collecting where you're going to keep collecting premium premium premium over< over and over again and this premium can over and over again and this premium can help< help with your cost basis reduction as help with your cost basis reduction as well< well so that means that the premium well so that means that the premium. which< which you buy actually offsets the cost which you buy actually offsets the cost price< price which you bought your stock at so price which you bought your stock at so let's< let's say if you bought your stock at let's say if you bought your stock at 100< 100 you collected two dollars premium 100 you collected two dollars premium for< for it essentially you have bought the for it essentially you have bought the stock< stock for at 98 right so this is so much stock for at 98 right so this is so much better< better than if you were to just buy long better than if you were to just buy long stock< stock and just hold it stock and just hold it and< and just you know you don't really get and just you know you don't really get any< any cost basis reduction on it and any cost basis reduction on it and reason< reason number three is you get paid reason number three is you get paid while< while waiting for your stock to hit your while waiting for your stock to hit your profit< profit target so if you are doing profit target so if you are doing trading< trading you know normally you will place trading you know normally you will place a< a limit order as your take profit order a limit order as your take profit order uh< uh as a place where you would you know uh as a place where you would you know get< get your to close your position and take get your to close your position and take a< a profit right so instead of placing a profit right so instead of placing your< your limit order to take profit what you your limit order to take profit what you can< can do is sell cover call at your take can do is sell cover call at your take profit< profit price so this way if the stock profit price so this way if the stock does< does not reach your profit target you does not reach your profit target you can< can still collect the premiums over and can still collect the premiums over and over< over again until the stock finally hits over again until the stock finally hits your< your private target so this way not only your private target so this way not only do< do you get the capital gain on the stock do you get the capital gain on the stock plus< plus you also get all the premiums that plus you also get all the premiums that you< you have collected while waiting for the you have collected while waiting for the stock< stock to finally hit your profit target stock to finally hit your profit target right right right all< all right so this is the p l graph for all right so this is the p l graph for uh< uh long stock so i'm using the example uh long stock so i'm using the example ibm< ibm again so if you were to buy the ibm again so if you were to buy the stock< stock at 137. 50 stock at 137.

50 you< you can see that you can see that you< you know it's just a very you know it's just a very straightforward< straightforward p l graph if you straightforward p l graph if you if< if the stock goes up one dollar if the stock goes up one dollar you< you know you make a dollar on every you know you make a dollar on every share< share you have if it goes down one share you have if it goes down one dollar< dollar you lose a dollar every share you dollar you lose a dollar every share you have< have nothing is particularly against you have nothing is particularly against you but< but there's nothing for you as well but there's nothing for you as well but< but if you were to sell a cover call but if you were to sell a cover call let's< let's say you were to sell a cover call let's say you were to sell a cover call at< at 142 at 142 and< and you collected a premium of two and you collected a premium of two dollars< dollars four cents so that is 204 dollars four cents so that is 204 dollars< dollars you can see the p l graph right dollars you can see the p l graph right here< here right here right if< if the price does not move if the price does not move you< you still are in profit whereas if you you still are in profit whereas if you previously< previously if the price didn't move previously if the price didn't move you< you you would not be making any money you you would not be making any money but< but with the cover call you can see that but with the cover call you can see that because< because you have collected the premium because you have collected the premium you< you will be in profit even though if the you will be in profit even though if the stock< stock doesn't move at expiration right stock doesn't move at expiration right and< and if the stock and if the stock were< were to go up were to go up all< all the way to your strike price the all the way to your strike price the thing< thing is that you will be capping your thing is that you will be capping your profit< profit at this price because then your profit at this price because then your stocks< stocks would be called away remember you stocks would be called away remember you have< have the obligation to sell your stock have the obligation to sell your stock at< at this price that is why you see this at this price that is why you see this flat< flat line here that means to say that if flat line here that means to say that if ibm< ibm was to go all the way to 149 your ibm was to go all the way to 149 your profit< profit would still be maxed out here profit would still be maxed out here that< that is of course if you do not roll that is of course if you do not roll your< your cover call but that's the topic for your cover call but that's the topic for another< another time but basically if you were another time but basically if you were to< to roll your cover call you can extend to roll your cover call you can extend the< the duration and the time of your profit the duration and the time of your profit again< again so that your long stock can again so that your long stock can continue< continue to make continue to make more< more profit as the stock appreciates more profit as the stock appreciates the< the other thing that's good about the the other thing that's good about the cover< cover call is because it reduces your cover call is because it reduces your break-even< break-even price basically it's the cost break-even price basically it's the cost basis< basis reduction i talked about you basis reduction i talked about you notice< notice that for long stock this is where notice that for long stock this is where your< your break even is basically it's at the your break even is basically it's at the place< place where you bought the stock at but place where you bought the stock at but with< with a cover call because you already with a cover call because you already collected< collected two dollars and four cents for collected two dollars and four cents for the< the premium the premium your< your effective price of your stock is your effective price of your stock is lower< lower at lower at 135 135 135 50< 50 cents thereabouts right that's 50 cents thereabouts right that's because< because you've collected this so imagine because you've collected this so imagine if< if you were to collect your cover calls if you were to collect your cover calls over< over and over again every 30 to 45 days over and over again every 30 to 45 days cycle< cycle right this break even will get cycle right this break even will get lower< lower and lower and lower so you have lower and lower and lower so you have effectively< effectively lowered the cost of your effectively lowered the cost of your stock< stock purchase which increases the stock purchase which increases the profitability< profitability of your stock position profitability of your stock position right< right so it is always the reason why i right so it is always the reason why i tell< tell people that you need to sell cover tell people that you need to sell cover calls< calls if you have 100 shares of stock calls if you have 100 shares of stock that's< that's the best way for you to hold a that's the best way for you to hold a stock< stock position stock position so< so how do you sell a cover call so there so how do you sell a cover call so there are< are five steps so the first step very are five steps so the first step very important< important one is to make sure that you important one is to make sure that you have< have a hundred shares of stock or a long have a hundred shares of stock or a long call< call against it if you don't have your call against it if you don't have your uh< uh you have a naked call position and uh you have a naked call position and you< you better know uh you better know what you better know uh you better know what you're< you're doing otherwise you're gonna you're doing otherwise you're gonna really< really lose a lot of money right step really lose a lot of money right step number< number two you wanna look for days to number two you wanna look for days to expiration< expiration 30 to 45 days out there's expiration 30 to 45 days out there's generally<. generally the optimal number of days you generally the optimal number of days you want< want to sell because want to sell because you< you get good premium as well as you have you get good premium as well as you have a< a pretty decent theta decay as well a pretty decent theta decay as well now< now step number three you want to now step number three you want to identify< identify where you would like to sell a identify where you would like to sell a cover< cover call basically this is a strike cover call basically this is a strike price< price where you want to sell it price where you want to sell it typically< typically i like to look at the delta typically i like to look at the delta which< which i will explain more a little bit which i will explain more a little bit later< later when we get on to the platform but later when we get on to the platform but basically< basically i like to look at a delta of basically i like to look at a delta of 15< 15 to 25 15 to 25 uh< uh some people like to go for a higher uh some people like to go for a higher delta< delta or lower delta this is a really delta or lower delta this is a really very< very personal preference but i think 15 very personal preference but i think 15 to< to 25 if it's a good place for you to to 25 if it's a good place for you to sell< sell your cover call if you still plan sell your cover call if you still plan to< to hold your stocks for a long time to hold your stocks for a long time right right right now< now step number four is look at the mark now step number four is look at the mark of< of the uh the mark of the option and of the uh the mark of the option and then< then place limit order around the market then place limit order around the market after< after that you just adjust lower the after that you just adjust lower the mark< mark until you mark until you lower< lower the price of your limit order lower the price of your limit order until< until you get filled so let's head over until you get filled so let's head over to< to the platform now i'm going to show to the platform now i'm going to show you< you some of the covered calls that i've you some of the covered calls that i've sold< sold and how you can go through this sold and how you can go through this five< five steps to sell your own cover call five steps to sell your own cover call okay< okay so this is the td ameritrade uh okay so this is the td ameritrade uh think< think or stream platform so as you can think or stream platform so as you can see< see i've got the see i've got the number< number of positions i've put on here in number of positions i've put on here in my< my account you can see that these are my account you can see that these are all< all my long stock positions right now so all my long stock positions right now so this< this uh for the long term this uh for the long term and< and the thing is that i only want to and the thing is that i only want to sell< sell cover calls on shares which i have sell cover calls on shares which i have a< a hundred shares of like i mentioned a hundred shares of like i mentioned before< before so you can see i've only got some before so you can see i've only got some of< of them that i've got a hundred shares of them that i've got a hundred shares or< or more most of them have under 100 or more most of them have under 100 which< which i'm still accumulating over time which i'm still accumulating over time so< so i'll only sell cover calls on them so so i'll only sell cover calls on them so you< you can see that i've sold two cover you can see that i've sold two cover calls< calls here calls here uh< uh one is on gxc the others on ita uh one is on gxc the others on ita so< so uh don't be fooled by the number here so uh don't be fooled by the number here because< because you see that although it is because you see that although it is losing< losing money uh the goo the thing is losing money uh the goo the thing is that< that because it moves towards your cover that because it moves towards your cover call< call price which means that your overall call price which means that your overall stock< stock position is in profit so if you stock position is in profit so if you were< were to put on a cover call and you were to put on a cover call and you would< would see that your p l open is losing would see that your p l open is losing money< money do not panic because this is a money do not panic because this is a good< good thing you want the stock to good thing you want the stock to actually< actually be moving towards your cover actually be moving towards your cover call< call where you're getting a profit that call where you're getting a profit that is is is so< so you can see that i saw ita down here so you can see that i saw ita down here um< um i sold the cover call for a dollar 15 um i sold the cover call for a dollar 15 cents< cents so it's about 115 dollars i have cents so it's about 115 dollars i have on< on gxc as well 125 dollars and apart on gxc as well 125 dollars and apart from< from the shares what i did is i sold from the shares what i did is i sold what< what do you call i bought what you call what do you call i bought what you call a< a poor man's cover call so basically a poor man's cover call so basically what< what i have is long stock uh long sorry what i have is long stock uh long sorry a< a long dated uh call option as you can a long dated uh call option as you can see< see is a very long dated one 480 days see is a very long dated one 480 days and< and i'm selling a cover call against it and i'm selling a cover call against it a< a shorter term a shorter term days< days to expiration down here so for days to expiration down here so for apple< apple you see i've collected 2. 60 so 260 apple you see i've collected 2.

60 so 260 i< i have i have ashr< ashr boeing i love boeing ashr boeing i love boeing i< i think it's a good stock as well and uh i think it's a good stock as well and uh seven< seven dollars and 79 cents what i got it seven dollars and 79 cents what i got it for for for so< so that's 779 dollars you can see the so that's 779 dollars you can see the position< position is up that means because the position is up that means because the stock< stock has gone up to roughly where my stock has gone up to roughly where my cover< cover call is cover call is uh< uh your baba which right now has been uh your baba which right now has been taking< taking a big hit but i'm not worried taking a big hit but i'm not worried about< about it because about it because you< you know i still have a very long time you know i still have a very long time and< and i think this is a fundamentally good. and i think this is a fundamentally good stock< stock so while waiting for the stock to stock so while waiting for the stock to finally< finally recover i'm selling covered finally recover i'm selling covered calls< calls on it so this is very important calls on it so this is very important especially< especially if you're doing investment especially if you're doing investment you're< you're planning to hold the stock or the you're planning to hold the stock or the call< call for a long time what you want to do call for a long time what you want to do is< is sell cover call to reduce your cost is sell cover call to reduce your cost basis< basis at the same time you get some basis at the same time you get some income< income along the way right so income along the way right so baba< baba i've rolled quite a number of times baba i've rolled quite a number of times already< already so you can see uh the premium already so you can see uh the premium for< for this is 3. 56 cents which is 356.

for this is 3. 56 cents which is 356.

uh< uh i have quite a number of facebook as uh i have quite a number of facebook as well< well good premium as well well good premium. as well 772< 772 dollars 772 dollars jd< jd jng lmt three dollars 18 cents jd jng lmt three dollars 18 cents uh< uh xbi uh xbi 2. 18< 2.

18 so you can see i've sold quite a 2. 18 so you can see i've sold quite a number< number of cover calls here number of cover calls here i've< i've also have some covered call i've also have some covered call variants< variants where i use the premium from variants where i use the premium from the< the cover call the cover call to< to buy a debit spread so this is a to buy a debit spread so this is a basically< basically a call ratio position so what basically a call ratio position so what i< i did is i sold cover calls you can see i did is i sold cover calls you can see i< i have four cover calls here because i i have four cover calls here because i have< have 400 have 400 shares< shares of iwm shares of iwm you< you can see here 400 shares of ibm you can see here 400 shares of ibm that's< that's why i saw four calls against it that's why i saw four calls against it so< so i fought cover calls and i sold sorry so i fought cover calls and i sold sorry with< with the premium i used half of it to go with the premium i used half of it to go and< and buy and buy a< a debit spread a call debit spread so a debit spread a call debit spread so this< this becomes a. call ratio this becomes a call ratio so< so you might see that i'm losing 339 so you might see that i'm losing 339 dollars< dollars here but do not be fooled by dollars here but do not be fooled by this< this again because this is a very this again because this is a very profitable< profitable position profitable position uh< uh let me just show it to you you can uh let me just show it to you you can see see see all< all right so you can see this is iwm so all right so you can see this is iwm so you< you can see i've sold four covered calls you can see i've sold four covered calls on< on it and i bought the debit spread so on it and i bought the debit spread so how< how does a debit spread look like how does a debit spread look like basically< basically it's just this right it's just basically it's just this right it's just a< a call vertical it's debit spread so i a call vertical it's debit spread so i paid< paid 412 dollars for this spread paid 412 dollars for this spread using< using the premium which i collected from using the premium which i collected from here< here i sold four premium four cover here i sold four premium four cover calls< calls on this which i collected 2.

50 calls on this which i collected 2. 50 each< each which is a total of each which is a total of 860< 860 dollars so i use half of that to go 860 dollars so i use half of that to go and< and buy the debit spread so you can see and buy the debit spread so you can see that< that this is where the price of iwm is that this is where the price of iwm is right< right now and you can see this is the right now and you can see this is the sweet< sweet spot of where it is right now so sweet spot of where it is right now so that< that means to say that if uh that means to say that if uh rwm< rwm stays here at expiration then you rwm stays here at expiration then you can< can see down here look at the blue color can see down here look at the blue color number< number here is that expiration i will be number here is that expiration i will be making< making 1249 making 1249 so so so this< this is uh one way that you can use the this is uh one way that you can use the cover< cover call premiums to manipulate cover call premiums to manipulate certain< certain positions and that is the beauty certain positions and that is the beauty of< of the options but of the options but this< this will be a topic for another time if this will be a topic for another time if you< you if you think you're interested to you if you think you're interested to. find< find out more about this maybe you can find out more about this maybe you can just< just let me know in the comments below just let me know in the comments below and< and i'll probably make a video about it and i'll probably make a video about it as< as well uh later on all right so i just as well uh later on all right so i just want< want to go to the how to place a cover want to go to the how to place a cover call< call all right so call all right so i'll< i'll go over the ibm i'll go over the ibm all< all right just use the same example as all right just use the same example as before before before and< and i'll do all groups so the first and i'll do all groups so the first thing< thing you want to do is remember step thing you want to do is remember step one< one ensure that you have 100 shares of one ensure that you have 100 shares of stock< stock right or maybe even a long call on stock right or maybe even a long call on it< it next you want to choose the days to it next you want to choose the days to expiration< expiration so you can see the dates to expiration so you can see the dates to expiration< expiration just from the numbers here so expiration just from the numbers here so ideally< ideally we want to go for anywhere from ideally we want to go for anywhere from 30< 30 to 45.

so in this example i'll go for 30 to 45. so in this example i'll go for the< the 32 the 32 so< so for 32 the next thing you want to do so for 32 the next thing you want to do is< is look at the delta so this is the is look at the delta so this is the delta< delta down here delta down here so< so you can see all the numbers. here so you can see all the numbers here right< right at the money basically is where right at the money basically is where the< the option is closest to the current the option is closest to the current strike< strike price right now the market is strike price right now the market is closed closed closed so< so it closed at so it closed at 137.

#### Topic 1

49< 137. 49 so roughly this is where the at 137.

49 so roughly this is where the at the< the money calls are the money calls are so< so you can see at the money call delta. so you can see at the money call delta is< is roughly 48 to 52 it's always around is roughly 48 to 52 it's always around 50. < 50.

so what you want to look out for is 50. so what you want to look out for is uh< uh 15 to 25 deltas so anyway uh 15 to 25 deltas so anyway you< you know these three options would be you know these three options would be good< good candidates for me to sell a cover good candidates for me to sell a cover call< call if i was to sell a covered call on call if i was to sell a covered call on this< this uh this uh on< on this stock on ibm right so on this stock on ibm right so if< if you want to sell a covered call on if you want to sell a covered call on this this this either< either of this would be good so the next either of this would be good so the next thing< thing i'll look at is basically the mark thing i'll look at is basically the mark remember< remember the next step is to remember the next step is to see< see the mark which is basically the mid see the mark which is basically the mid price< price of the bid and offer right because price of the bid and offer right because you< you do not want to sell directly at the you do not want to sell directly at the bid< bid because there is the bidder spread bid because there is the bidder spread if< if you want to sell this and buy if you want to sell this and buy immediately< immediately you will lose 30 cents and immediately you will lose 30 cents and that's< that's not what you want so you you want that's not what you want so you you want to< to make sure that you place it at the to make sure that you place it at the. at< at the mark so if you want to buy sorry at the mark so if you want to buy sorry if< if you want to go ahead and place this if you want to go ahead and place this cover< cover call cover call click< click on this down here click on this down here and< and you can see it says sell one call at and you can see it says sell one call at 145< 145 and this is the premium that you 145 and this is the premium that you receive< receive now remember this is the bid receive now remember this is the bid price price price this< this is the market price you want to do this is the market price you want to do it< it at the mark price so the mark price it at the mark price so the mark price will< will be at one two five will be at one two five so< so what i'll do is i'll adjust it to so what i'll do is i'll adjust it to roughly< roughly around one two five roughly around one two five and< and if you're okay with it all you have and if you're okay with it all you have to< to do is just hit the confirm and send to do is just hit the confirm and send and< and you will see all the details that and you will see all the details that you< you need to know down here so you can you need to know down here so you can see< see that the credit they'll give you is see that the credit they'll give you is 125< 125 dollars minus off the commission of 125 dollars minus off the commission of 65< 65 cents and that is 124.

35 65 cents and that is 124. 35 credit< credit and that is into your pocket all credit and that is into your pocket all right< right so this is how you place a cover right so this is how you place a cover call call call and< and you can see down here the buying and you can see down here the buying power< power effect is minus two thousand power effect is minus two thousand dollars< dollars and that's only because i do not dollars and that's only because i do not have< have a position in ibm if i have a have a position in ibm if i have a position< position by ibm then there would be no position by ibm then there would be no buying< buying power reduction buying power reduction okay< okay so once i'm okay with this all i okay so once i'm okay with this all i have< have to do is just click the send button have to do is just click the send button and< and then it will be placed as a limit and then it will be placed as a limit order order order and< and what i'll do next is basically just and what i'll do next is basically just adjust< adjust the price because not all the adjust the price because not all the time< time you will be able to get filled at time you will be able to get filled at the< the mark price uh sometime you get fuel the mark price uh sometime you get fuel at< at the mark price sometimes you would be at the mark price sometimes you would be feel< feel slightly higher or lower so what feel slightly higher or lower so what i'll< i'll do is that i'll just put up the i'll do is that i'll just put up the order< order and just wait for maybe uh 30 order and just wait for maybe uh 30 seconds< seconds or a minute or so to see whether seconds or a minute or so to. see whether i< i get filled if i don't get filled i'll i get filled if i don't get filled i'll just< just adjust it i'll adjust it to maybe just adjust it i'll adjust it to maybe 20< 20 cents and then try again if i still 20 cents and then try again if i still don't< don't get fuel i probably try and adjust don't get fuel i probably try and adjust a< a few cents lower again but i'll try as a few cents lower again but i'll try as much< much as possible to try and stay at much as possible to try and stay at around< around the mark price and remember the around the mark price and remember the market< market when it's open it's always moving market when it's open it's always moving back< back and forth so the price will be back and forth so the price will be changing< changing all the time so changing all the time so the< the best is to just put around the mark the best is to just put around the mark price price price and< and just adjust a little bit each time and just adjust a little bit each time down< down until you finally get filled all down until you finally get filled all right< right so that's how exactly you place right so that's how exactly you place your< your cover call your cover call so< so if you like this video and you found so if you like this video and you found this< this video helpful please subscribe and this video helpful please subscribe and please< please hit the thumbs up as well and if please hit the thumbs up as well and if there's< there's any questions that you have there's any questions that you have please< please just leave it in the comments please just leave it in the comments below< below i'll get back to you soon about it below i'll get back to you soon about it and<

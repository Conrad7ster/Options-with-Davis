================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we< we are going to be talking about in my we are going to be talking about in my humble< humble opinion what I think is the best humble opinion what I think is the best options< options income strategy for beginners options income strategy for beginners right< right so if you're just starting out right so if you're just starting out trading< trading options or maybe you've been trading options or maybe you've been trading< trading options for less than a year or trading options for less than a year or maybe< maybe if your account size is not that maybe if your account size is not that big< big maybe something like less than fifty big maybe something like less than fifty thousand< thousand dollars then I do think that thousand dollars then I do think that this< this strategy is very suitable for you this strategy is very suitable for you all< all right so what is this best options all right so what is this best options income< income strategy for beginners Well that income strategy for beginners Well that is< is none other than the iron condom a is none other than the iron condom a condor condor condor the< the iron Condor did I just say the iron the iron Condor did I just say the iron condom< condom my apologies guys this is this we condom my apologies guys this is this we we< we on that channel all right so we are we on that channel all right so we are not< not going to be talking about iron not going to be talking about iron condoms< condoms here although the concept is a condoms here although the concept is a little< little bit interesting don't you think little bit interesting don't you think maybe< maybe it might be a best seller all maybe it might be a best seller all right< right guys let's get back to business right guys let's get back to business let's< let's get back to talking about options let's get back to talking about options right< right so we are going to be talking right so we are going to be talking about< about the iron Condor I got it right about the iron Condor I got it right right< right now right now all< all right so what is the iron Condor if all right so what is the iron Condor if you're< you're not familiar with the iron Condor you're not familiar with the iron Condor well< well it is actually just a defined Rich well it is actually just a defined Rich strategy< strategy with the combination of a put strategy with the combination of a put credit< credit spread which is also what is credit spread which is also what is known< known as the blue put spread plus the known as the blue put spread plus the call< call Credit spread which is also known call Credit spread which is also known as< as the bear call spread right so as you as the bear call spread right so as you can< can see down here this is the p l graph can see down here this is the p l graph for< for the iron Condor so basically on the for the iron Condor so basically on the left< left hand side you have the put credit left hand side you have the put credit spread< spread right this is also what you call spread right this is also what you call the< the Boot put spread and on the right the Boot put spread and on the right hand< hand side you have the construct of a hand side you have the construct of a call< call Credit spare which is the bad call call Credit spare which is the bad call spread< spread so if you're familiar with spread so if you're familiar with trading< trading credit spreads already then it's trading credit spreads already then it's just< just a combination of both of them right just a combination of both of them right you< you join them both together and you have you join them both together and you have what< what you call the iron Condor so if you what you call the iron Condor so if you were< were to take a look at this chart down were to take a look at this chart down here< here then you will notice that you know here then you will notice that you know the< the strikes are on the opposite side of the strikes are on the opposite side of each< each other what it's trying. to do is to each other what it's trying to do is to try< try and capture profits if the market try and capture profits if the market stays< stays within a range right so as you can stays within a range right so as you can see< see down here the profit range is pretty see down here the profit range is pretty big< big right so most of the time when we big right so most of the time when we trade< trade the iron Condor right it's pretty trade the iron Condor right it's pretty much< much also considered trading the much also considered trading the expected< expected move right so if you're not expected move right so if you're not familiar< familiar with the term expected move I familiar with the term expected move I already< already talked about it in another video already talked about it in another video which< which is the number one secret for being which is the number one secret for being consistently< consistently profitable uh to trade the consistently profitable uh to trade the options< options right so for this iron Condor options right so for this iron Condor basically< basically it's training the expected basically it's training the expected move< move and is trying to capture the move and is trying to capture the profits< profits in within this range and from profits in within this range and from what< what we already know right most of the what we already know right most of the time< time the market will stay within this time the market will stay within this expected< expected range right more often than it expected range right more often than it does< does not so why do I think that the iron does not so why do I think that the iron Condor< Condor is the best options income Condor is the best options income strategy< strategy for beginners right and there strategy for beginners right and there are< are five reasons for this right so the are five reasons for this right so the very< very first reason is that this is a very first reason is that this is a defined< defined risk strategy that means to say defined risk strategy that means to say the< the max risk has been kept right as you the max risk has been kept right as you can< can see down here there is the long can see down here there is the long options< options already bought down here on both options already bought down here on both sides< sides right if you do not have this long sides right if you do not have this long options< options so what it becomes is just two options so what it becomes is just two naked< naked options this is where you call naked options this is where you call this< this triangle but because you have these this triangle but because you have these two< two long options let me just remove the two long options let me just remove the drawings< drawings here because you have these two drawings here because you have these two long< long options so what it does is that it long options so what it does is that it caps< caps the max risk so if for some reason caps the max risk so if for some reason the< the market just shoots all the way to the market just shoots all the way to the< the Moon right or maybe it crashes all the Moon right or maybe it crashes all the< the way to zero well guess what you the way to zero well guess what you cannot< cannot lose more than what you have cannot lose more than what you have already< already defined the risk at the start already defined the risk at the start for< for the iron Condor right so that is why for the iron Condor right so that is why this< this is considered relatively safe and this is considered relatively safe and very< very good for you if you're just very good for you if you're just starting< starting out right so this way you won't starting out right so this way you won't let< let any single trade take you out of the let any single trade take you out of the game< game now reason number two is that it game now reason number two is that it has< has a decently High win rate right so if has a decently High win rate right so if you< you can see in this graph down here you you can see in this graph down here you can< can see that the win rate is 68. 26 so can see that the win rate is 68.

26 so this< this is the typical win rate so this is this is the typical win rate so this is roughly< roughly around 16 to 20 deltas okay on roughly around 16 to 20 deltas okay on both< both sides so on both short strides so both sides so on both short strides so this< this is the normal typical uh profit this is the normal typical uh profit probability< probability or profit for a iron Condor probability or profit for a iron Condor all< all right so for the iron Condor all right so for the iron Condor although< although it says it you know the typical although it says it you know the typical range< range is about 65 to 68 generally we range is about 65 to 68 generally we actually< actually can have a higher win rate actually can have a higher win rate because< because as we already know as I talked because as we already know as I talked about< about it many times in other videos as about it many times in other videos as well< well that IV most of the time is often well that IV most of the time is often overstated< overstated compared to the RV right IV overstated compared to the RV right IV means< means the implied volatility RV means means the implied volatility RV means the< the realized volatility right in limit the realized volatility right in limit terms< terms what it means is that the expected terms what it means is that the expected range< range or rather the range that is being range or rather the range that is being you< you know forecasted by this implied you know forecasted by this implied volatility< volatility is usually much bigger than volatility is usually much bigger than what< what where the market actually moves so what where the market actually moves so most< most of the time it actually stays most of the time it actually stays within< within the range that is why you have a within the range that is why you have a higher< higher win rate so as you can see down higher win rate so as you can see down here< here this is a study done by the tasty here this is a study done by the tasty trade< trade team right this is on the 20 Delta trade team right this is on the 20 Delta uh< uh five dollar wide iron Condor right so uh five dollar wide iron Condor right so if< if you were to think about it Delta is if you were to think about it Delta is also< also used as a rough estimation for the also used as a rough estimation for the probability< probability of it being in the money probability of it being in the money right< right so for example if you have on one right so for example if you have on one side< side let's say for example this is the side let's say for example this is the shot< shot put let's say for example this is a shot put let's say for example this is a 20< 20 Delta so what it also means right it 20 Delta so what it also means right it has< has an estimate that there is a 20 has an estimate that there is a 20 chance< chance that the market will actually chance that the market will actually close< close below this shot put at expiration close below this shot put at expiration all< all right so again this is just an all right so again this is just an estimate< estimate right the real uh probability estimate right the real uh probability you< you will have to take a look at the you will have to take a look at the column< column all right chord probability of column all right chord probability of being< being in the money right but it's pretty being in the money right but it's pretty close< close right it's off by maybe one or two close right it's off by maybe one or two percent< percent right so imagine if you have on percent right so imagine if you have on both< both sides you have 20 Delta which means both sides you have 20 Delta which means to< to say on both sides there is a 20 to say on both sides there is a 20 chance< chance of either being in the money on chance of either being in the money on both< both sides so what does it live in the both sides so what does it live in the middle< middle right you have 20 on the top side middle right you have 20 on the top side you're< you're 20 on the bottom side which means you're 20 on the bottom side which means to< to say it should be sixty percent of the to say it should be sixty percent of the time< time the market actually stays within time the market actually stays within this< this range down here within the short this range down here within the short call< call and the shot put strikes but call and the shot put strikes but instead< instead if you notice we are actually instead if you notice we are actually getting< getting more than this 60 based on the getting more than this 60 based on the 20< 20 Delta uh five dollar wide iron Condor 20 Delta uh five dollar wide iron Condor so< so this supports the fact that the IV so this supports the fact that the IV often< often overstates the realized volatility often overstates the realized volatility so< so that is why you actually tend to get so that is why you actually tend to get a< a higher win rate than what is a higher win rate than what is theoretically< theoretically suggested right based on theoretically suggested right based on the< the p l graph so remember when we are the p l graph so remember when we are trading< trading the iron Condor the main reason trading the iron Condor the main reason why< why we want to trade it is because we why we want to trade it is because we want< want to generate an income so if you want to generate an income so if you want< want to generate an income you want to generate an income you definitely< definitely want to have something you definitely want to have something you know< know that is pretty often that you can know that is pretty often that you can win< win right you want it to be consistent win right you want it to be consistent win< win as well so that is why with the iron win as well so that is why with the iron Condor< Condor you have a win rate of pretty Condor you have a win rate of pretty high< high right I would say average around 70 high right I would say average around 70 percent percent percent so< so that is why this is also a good so that is why this is also a good reason< reason why I think this is a a good reason why I think this is a a good income< income strategy for beginners but now income strategy for beginners but now reason< reason number three is that you do not reason number three is that you do not have< have to pick a direction right so one of have to pick a direction right so one of the< the hardest thing for many people when the hardest thing for many people when they< they first start trading options is you they first start trading options is you know< know where which direction should they know where which direction should they pick< pick right they're not sure whether pick right they're not sure whether should< should they be bullish should they be should they be bullish should they be bearish< bearish is the market going up is the bearish is the market going up is the market< market going down so the best way if market going down so the best way if you're< you're not sure then all you have to do you're not sure then all you have to do is< is just trade the expected move right is just trade the expected move right basically< basically all you're going to say is basically all you're going to say is that< that I have no idea is the market going that I have no idea is the market going down< down I have no idea if the market is down I have no idea if the market is going< going up but I do know that the market going up but I do know that the market will< will move in the next don't know how will move in the next don't know how many< many days right based on the expiration many days right based on the expiration date< date of the options and you know that it date of the options and you know that it will< will stay within a certain range right will stay within a certain range right more< more often than it does not right so all more often than it does not right so all you< you have to do is put on the iron Condor you have to do is put on the iron Condor and< and you that's why you get the and you that's why you get the probability< probability of win of somewhere around probability of win of somewhere around 65< 65 at the birth right and it's a good 65 at the birth right and it's a good way< way to trade the expected move and takes way to trade the expected move and takes advantage< advantage of the fact that the realized advantage of the fact that the realized volatility< volatility D is less than the IV which volatility D is less than the IV which is< is what I talked about and again this is is what I talked about and again this is the< the studies done by the tasty trade team the studies done by the tasty trade team they've< they've done a lot of research into this they've done a lot of research into this as< as well and as you can see based on this as well and as you can see based on this index< index ETF which is the spiders the index ETF which is the spiders the average< average realized move you can see is average realized move you can see is much< much lesser than the average expected much lesser than the average expected move< move right as you can see in fact for move right as you can see in fact for all< all different volatility levels even if all different volatility levels even if it's< it's a low volatility environment or a it's a low volatility environment or a very< very. high volatility environment right very high volatility environment right in< in both cases the IV which is depicted in both cases the IV which is depicted by< by the expected move right is greater by the expected move right is greater than< than the actual movement in the market than the actual movement in the market right< right which is depicted by the realized right which is depicted by the realized volatility< volatility right so the realized volatility right so the realized volatility< volatility is less than the IV now this volatility is less than the IV now this is< is not just for the spiders it's also is not just for the spiders it's also for< for the other index ETFs like the iwm for the other index ETFs like the iwm and< and the QQQ so that is why the index and the QQQ so that is why the index ETFs< ETFs are a very very good vehicle for ETFs are a very very good vehicle for you< you to trade this iron Condor so let's you to trade this iron Condor so let's get< get into reason number four and that is get into reason number four and that is that< that it is very versatile right so what that it is very versatile right so what I< I mean by versatile versatile means that I mean by versatile versatile means that you< you can actually construct it based on you can actually construct it based on your< your outlook of the market right it can your outlook of the market right it can be< be neutral right so as you can see it is be neutral right so as you can see it is pretty< pretty equidistant right almost pretty equidistant right almost equidistant< equidistant right because sometimes or equidistant right because sometimes or rather< rather all the time when you trade on rather all the time when you trade on index< index ETFs they tend to have put skills index ETFs they tend to have put skills which< which means to say right the put if you which means to say right the put if you were< were to both use a 20 deltas were to both use a 20 deltas let's< let's say we're going to use 20 Deltas let's say we're going to use 20 Deltas as< as example then you'll notice that the as example then you'll notice that the 20< 20 Deltas okay this should be a triangle 20 Deltas okay this should be a triangle not< not a zero all right so you'll notice not a zero all right so you'll notice that< that for the put side it will be lower that for the put side it will be lower than< than the call side right so maybe the than the call side right so maybe the the< the distance from where the market price the distance from where the market price is< is to the put right just as an example is to the put right just as an example maybe< maybe this would be 30 points whereas maybe this would be 30 points whereas from< from here to here is maybe let's say 25 from here to here is maybe let's say 25 points< points right that is because that is the points right that is because that is the put< put skills now it's also very versatile put skills now it's also very versatile because< because it could also be a bullish iron because it could also be a bullish iron Condor< Condor which means to say you think that Condor which means to say you think that the< the market might actually go up right the market might actually go up right but< but then you also want a little bit of a but then you also want a little bit of a hedge< hedge in case you're wrong right so the hedge in case you're wrong right so the typical< typical way that people would actually typical way that people would actually you< you know put on a trade when it comes to you know put on a trade when it comes to a< a bullish Outlook right is they will a bullish Outlook right is they will actually< actually put a bull put spread right so actually put a bull put spread right so let's< let's say for example you do not have let's say for example you do not have this< this call spread down here this would this call spread down here this would just< just be the blue put spread right you just be the blue put spread right you just< just put this blue put spread down here just put this blue put spread down here for< for their bullish view now there's one for their bullish view now there's one problem< problem with this idea or rather this problem with this idea or rather this strategy< strategy with the blue put spread and strategy with the blue put spread and that< that is what if you're wrong right that is what if you're wrong right because< because if you are wrong what happens is because if you are wrong what happens is that< that you will take the full heat of this that you will take the full heat of this loss< loss which you've already defined in the loss which you've already defined in the starting< starting place right so that's fine but starting place right so that's fine but if< if you have this call spread along with if you have this call spread along with it< it making it into an iron Condor right it making it into an iron Condor right let< let me just remove the drawings here so let me just remove the drawings here so now< now you have both sides so even though now you have both sides so even though if< if the market goes down here what you if the market goes down here what you lose< lose here at least you will make a lose here at least you will make a little< little bit based on this credit spread little bit based on this credit spread right< right because when you sell this call right because when you sell this call spread< spread down here you're also getting a spread down here you're also getting a premium< premium for it so this is slightly premium for it so this is slightly better< better I feel compared to if you were to better I feel compared to if you were to just< just put on the bull put spread now of just put on the bull put spread now of course< course if you have a very very bullish course if you have a very very bullish view< view you think the market is going to go view you think the market is going to go up< up then of course you can just put on up then of course you can just put on the< the bull put spread now if you're more the bull put spread now if you're more bearish< bearish then guess what you can shift it bearish then guess what you can shift it down< down as well right so if you notice this down as well right so if you notice this is< is the neutral if I want it to be is the neutral if I want it to be bullish< bullish I just shift the whole thing up bullish I just shift the whole thing up if< if I wanted to be bearish I shift it if I wanted to be bearish I shift it down< down so as you can see I shift the iron down so as you can see I shift the iron Condor< Condor down and you cannot see the long Condor down and you cannot see the long strike< strike down here in fact it has gone so strike down here in fact it has gone so far< far down below this that you cannot even far down below this that you cannot even see< see it right so there is a long put see it right so there is a long put below< below which I didn't put down here below which I didn't put down here because< because you know it's out of the screen because you know it's out of the screen so< so basically if you are bearish right so basically if you are bearish right now< now then guess what now then guess what this< this a put spread down here also serves this a put spread down here also serves as< as a hedge to your call spread down here as a hedge to your call spread down here because< because in case if you're wrong the because in case if you're wrong the market< market shoots through at least you still market shoots through at least you still have< have this put spread down here so that have this put spread down here so that is< is why I would prefer that you actually is why I would prefer that you actually use< use the iron Condor bullish or the use the iron Condor bullish or the bearish< bearish one rather than just you know bearish one rather than just you know going< going alone with the you know the call going alone with the you know the call Credit< Credit spread or the put credit spread Credit spread or the put credit spread because< because if you also think about it you because if you also think about it you actually< actually get more credit because now you actually get more credit because now you get< get an additional credit with the other get an additional credit with the other side< side so that's how you reduce your side so that's how you reduce your overall< overall risk as well okay now reason overall risk as well okay now reason number< number five and that is that it is number five and that is that it is profitable< profitable over the long run by the way profitable over the long run by the way if< if you like this video so far Please if you like this video so far Please Subscribe< Subscribe and also

com blueprint or< or right back to the video so again as or right back to the video so again as you< you can see down here this is a test you can see down here this is a test done< done by the tastytrade team so this is done by the tastytrade team so this is the< the cumulative performance of a 20 Delta the cumulative performance of a 20 Delta 10< 10 wide iron Condor right so basically 10 wide iron Condor right so basically the< the wings are ten dollar wide the Deltas the wings are ten dollar wide the Deltas are< are 20 and as you can see down here they are 20 and as you can see down here they show< show two different graph results right show two different graph results right this< this is if you were to exit your trade this is if you were to exit your trade at< at 21 DTE at 21 DTE and< and this is if you were to exit at and this is if you were to exit at expiration< expiration so in both cases they are expiration so in both cases they are actually< actually profitable right just that the actually profitable right just that the 21< 21 DT is more profitable compared to if 21 DT is more profitable compared to if you< you hold to expiration all right so this you hold to expiration all right so this one< one thing you want to take note of now one thing you want to take note of now when< when people start trading iron condor when people start trading iron condor right< right normally they will transition from right normally they will transition from credit< credit spreads because credit spreads credit spreads because credit spreads they're< they're very used to it it's a very they're very used to it it's a very simple< simple spread you either are bullish simple spread you either are bullish right< right you put on the boo-boo spread your right you put on the boo-boo spread your bearish< bearish you put on the back or spread bearish you put on the back or spread but< but when they start to put on both sides but when they start to put on both sides like< like the iron Condor they're not really like the iron Condor they're not really sure< sure what to do and a lot of times they sure what to do and a lot of times they actually< actually do get into trouble and they actually do get into trouble and they start< start to lose money with the iron Condor start to lose money with the iron Condor right< right so I want to share with you what right so I want to share with you what are< are the top three mistakes that people are the top three mistakes that people actually< actually do when they're training the actually do when they're training the iron< iron Condor so these are the top three iron Condor so these are the top three mistakes< mistakes that you want to avoid when you mistakes that you want to avoid when you start< start trading the iron Condor right so start trading the iron Condor right so mistake< mistake number one and this is a very mistake number one and this is a very common< common mistake that I see many people common mistake that I see many people make< make especially I do see a lot of make especially I do see a lot of YouTube< YouTube creators as well they actually YouTube creators as well they actually have< have been advocating having very tight have been advocating having very tight Wings< Wings right having very small width for Wings right having very small width for your< your iron Condor so basically I have your iron Condor so basically I have down< down here two iron Condors as a down here two iron Condors as a comparison< comparison so you can see down here on comparison so you can see down here on the< the left hand side we have a two dollar the left hand side we have a two dollar wide< wide iron Condor and down here is a 10 wide iron Condor and down here is a 10 wide< wide iron condor so what it just means wide iron condor so what it just means is< is that the wings right for this is 10 is that the wings right for this is 10 wide< wide okay and which is for both sides wide okay and which is for both sides and< and for this it's only two dollars why and for this it's only two dollars why okay< okay so now at first glance okay so now at first glance you< you can see right tell me what do you you can see right tell me what do you think< think or which do you think is the more think or which do you think is the more riskier< riskier trade well at first glance of riskier trade well at first glance of course< course a lot of people will just say the course a lot of people will just say the more< more riskier trade would be this the 10 more riskier trade would be this the 10 white< white iron Condor right because your max white iron Condor right because your max loss< loss is 750 dollars whereas for this two loss is 750 dollars whereas for this two dollar< dollar wide your max loss is only a dollar wide your max loss is only a hundred< hundred and twenty five dollars so you hundred and twenty five dollars so you actually< actually lose much less than a 10 wide actually lose much less than a 10 wide iron< iron Condor right so that's why a lot of iron Condor right so that's why a lot of people< people say all right go for the two people say all right go for the two dollar< dollar one it's much safer right you dollar one it's much safer right you kept< kept your risk and you do not lose that kept your risk and you do not lose that much< much but there's one thing that they are much but there's one thing that they are forgetting< forgetting right there's one thing that forgetting right there's one thing that is< is missing down here because don't is missing down here because don't forget< forget when you enter your trade each forget when you enter your trade each time< time when you enter your trade you will time when you enter your trade you will always< always have to take into account your always have to take into account your risk< risk per trade right your risk per trade risk per trade right your risk per trade which< which is the dollar amount that you're which is the dollar amount that you're going< going to risk every single trade so going to risk every single trade so let's< let's say for example you have a pretty let's say for example you have a pretty decent< decent sized capital and for each trade decent sized capital and for each trade when< when you allocate capital to each trade when you allocate capital to each trade let's< let's say the max risk you can allocate let's say the max. risk you can allocate to< to that trade is 750 dollars right let's to that trade is 750 dollars right let's just< just say your maximum risk based on your just say your maximum risk based on your Capital< Capital allocation the most you can risk Capital allocation the most you can risk per< per trade is 750 so you could either go per trade is 750 so you could either go for< for one ten dollar wide iron Condor or for one ten dollar wide iron Condor or if< if you go for the two dollar wide iron if you go for the two dollar wide iron condo< condo let me ask you would you just put condo let me ask you would you just put on< on one two dollar wide iron Condor of on one two dollar wide iron Condor of course< course not right because based on proper course not right because based on proper Capital< Capital allocation you want to size up Capital allocation you want to size up your< your trades so that each trade will be your trades so that each trade will be equal< equal to you know the risk per trade equal to you know the risk per trade that< that you are actually putting on for the that you are actually putting on for the trade< trade right so in this case you wouldn't trade right so in this case you wouldn't actually< actually just put on one two dollar wide actually just put on one two dollar wide iron< iron Condor instead you would have to iron Condor instead you would have to put< put on six two dollar wide iron Condor put on six two dollar wide iron Condor so< so this way your max risk right now is so this way your max risk right now is the< the same it's at 750 dollars which is the same it's at 750 dollars which is the< the risk per trade which you have the risk per trade which you have already< already decided on to allocate to every already decided on to allocate to every trade< trade that you put on right so right now trade that you put on right so right now for< for this two dollar white iron Condor for this two dollar white iron Condor you< you have a Max risk of 750 for the ten you have a Max risk of 750 for the ten dollars< dollars why you also have a Max risk of dollars why you also have a Max risk of 750< 750 so right now we are kind of speaking 750 so right now we are kind of speaking Apples< Apples to Apples oranges to oranges Apples to Apples oranges to oranges right right right so< so now if you take a look at this which so now if you take a look at this which do< do you think is actually more risky do you think is actually more risky right< right if you think about it and if you right if you think about it and if you think< think about this rationally and you see think about this rationally and you see it< it right it right it's< it's actually much more riskier for this it's actually much more riskier for this two< two dollar white iron Condor but why two dollar white iron Condor but why because< because the market if the market goes because the market if the market goes all< all the way up this way and it stops all the way up this way and it stops here< here right at 205 let's say it stops at here right at 205 let's say it stops at 205< 205 is where the it settles let's say 205 is where the it settles let's say the< the expiration the expiration for< for your two dollar wide iron Condor how for your two dollar wide iron Condor how much< much are you going to lose much are you going to lose guess< guess what you are going to lose the guess what you are going to lose the full< full amount of 750 dollars right because full amount of 750 dollars right because your< your max loss is all the way at this your max loss is all the way at this point< point anything past this blue line down point anything past this blue line down here< here you're going to lose the max loss here you're going to lose the max loss but< but what about the 10 dollar wide iron but what about the 10 dollar wide iron Condor< Condor well the 10 watt iron Condor you Condor well the 10 watt iron Condor you actually< actually do not have the max loss actually do not have the max loss because< because the max loss has to be passed because the max loss has to be passed all< all the way here right past this blue all the way here right past this blue line< line over here but as of this moment it line over here but as of this moment it has< has not it's somewhere in the middle so has not it's somewhere in the middle so for< for the 10 watt iron Condor most likely for the 10 watt iron Condor most likely you< you will only lose about 50 of the max you will only lose about 50 of the max risk< risk right whereas for the two dollars risk right whereas for the two dollars while< while encoder you're going to lose while encoder you're going to lose everything< everything that you have reached for everything that you have reached for this< this trade so as you can see down here this trade so as you can see down here the< the reason why many people mistake that the reason why many people mistake that the< the two dollar white iron Condor having the two dollar white iron Condor having tight< tight Wings is less riskier is because tight Wings is less riskier is because they< they just think that per trade or rather they just think that per trade or rather per< per contract is less risk but you notice per contract is less risk but you notice as< as you can see down here you have to as you can see down here you have to allocate< allocate Capital so down here clearly allocate Capital so down here clearly it's< it's so much easier for this two dollar it's so much easier for this two dollar wide< wide iron Condor to lose money because wide iron Condor to lose money because the< the market does not have to move much the market does not have to move much to< to hit the max loss compared to the 10 to hit the max loss compared to the 10 wide< wide iron Condor as you can see it is so wide iron Condor as you can see it is so much< much difference right from this point much difference right from this point where< where the two dollars wide iron Condor where the two dollars wide iron Condor hit< hit its Max loss compared to the 10 wide hit its Max loss compared to the 10 wide iron< iron Condor where it hits its Max loss iron Condor where it hits its Max loss right< right it's about 7. 50 wide okay so right it's about 7.

50 wide okay so that's< that's why as you can see this is a that's why as you can see this is a mistake< mistake that many people make mistake mistake that many people make mistake number< number two and that is having a stop number two and that is having a stop loss< loss so I actually have a number of loss so I actually have a number of people< people that have emailed me you know people that have emailed me you know they< they are asking me some of the they are asking me some of the strategies< strategies that I've shared and I said strategies that I've shared and I said Davis< Davis what if we Implement a stop loss Davis what if we Implement a stop loss will< will this actually help reduce the risk will this actually help reduce the risk and< and help increase the performance well and help increase the performance well the< the tasty trade team as well they have the tasty trade team as well they have already< already came up with this study right so already came up with this study right so they< they went to test whether having a stop they went to test whether having a stop loss< loss is actually effective right so for loss is actually effective right so for this< this they tested it on the strangle this they tested it on the strangle which< which is actually pretty close to the which is actually pretty close to the iron< iron Condor because the iron Condor is iron Condor because the iron Condor is just< just the defined wrist version right the just the defined wrist version right the strangle< strangle they do not have this long call strangle they do not have this long call they< they don't have the shot put this long they don't have the shot put this long put< put I'm in but pretty much it's about put I'm in but pretty much it's about the< the same so as you can see down here the same so as you can see down here they< they tested two different uh management they tested two different uh management first< first one is to just. hold to expiration first one is to just hold to expiration the< the second one is to have a stop loss the second one is to have a stop loss and< and if you notice and if you notice the< the one with the stop loss right that's the one with the stop loss right that's 2x< 2x whatever your credit is I think so 2x whatever your credit is I think so basically< basically if your credit is a dollar basically if your credit is a dollar then< then they will have a stop loss where if then they will have a stop loss where if it< it reaches your credit becomes three it reaches your credit becomes three dollars< dollars right because remember we are dollars right because remember we are selling< selling credit we are option sellers so selling credit we are option sellers so if< if we sell at a dollar we ideally want if we sell at a dollar we ideally want the< the price to go down we want it to go to the price to go down we want it to go to zero< zero dollars that's the best case zero dollars that's the best case scenario< scenario that means we will earn this scenario that means we will earn this full< full one dollar right but if uh the full one dollar right but if uh the spread< spread is actually losing money it will spread is actually losing money it will actually< actually go up in price right because actually go up in price right because now< now you are selling at one dollar you're now you are selling at one dollar you're buying< buying back at you know a higher price buying back at you know a higher price that's< that's why you're losing money so this that's why you're losing money so this 2x< 2x basically is just 2x the premium that 2x basically is just 2x the premium that you< you have sold it for in terms of your you have sold it for in terms of your loss< loss so your profit will be 100 bucks loss so your profit will be 100 bucks per< per contract and will be lost 200. so per contract and will be lost 200.

so this< this is how they are testing it so as this is how they are testing it so as you< you can see in the long term managing you can see in the long term managing losers< losers or having a stop loss is actually losers or having a stop loss is actually not< not that effective you might as well not that effective you might as well just< just hold it to expiration and you have just hold it to expiration and you have a< a better chance of getting a better a better chance of getting a better result< result all right so mistake number three result all right so mistake number three is< is holding two expiration in all right is holding two expiration in all right so< so why is this a mistake well as you can so why is this a mistake well as you can see< see down here if you were to exit your see down here if you were to exit your trade< trade at 21 DTE you can see that your trade at 21 DTE you can see that your performance< performance is basically much more performance is basically much more Superior< Superior right at the end of the day you Superior right at the end of the day you get< get a higher daily p l so if you were to get a higher daily p l so if you were to take< take a look at the graph as well which take a look at the graph as well which you< you have seen earlier you can see that you have seen earlier you can see that the< the performance is so big of a the performance is so big of a difference< difference right you can see that difference right you can see that exiting< exiting at 21 DTE you actually have a exiting at 21 DTE you actually have a much< much better result compared if you hold much better result compared if you hold to< to expiration so that is why you know it to expiration so that is why you know it would< would be better if you want to exit at would be better if you want to exit at 21< 21 DTE rather than hold your trade to 21 DTE rather than hold your trade to expiration< expiration because if you hold your expiration because if you hold your trade< trade to expiration you also have trade to expiration you also have another< another risk and that is the risk of another risk and that is the risk of early< early assignment right if your short early assignment right if your short strikes< strikes are in the money let's say the strikes are in the money let's say the market< market is somewhere down here and market is somewhere down here and there's< there's like what two days left to go there's like what two days left to go there's< there's a very good chance that you're there's a very good chance that you're going< going to be exercised here right if going to be exercised here right. if you're< you're going to get exercise you're you're going to get exercise you're going< going to be assigned on the short call going to be assigned on the short call then< then guess what you're going to be short then guess what you're going to be short a< a hundred shares per contract on the a hundred shares per contract on the other< other hand if you're going to be other hand if you're going to be exercised< exercised on this shot put then guess exercised on this shot put then guess what< what per contract you're going to be what per contract you're going to be long< long 100 shares and if you're going to long 100 shares and if you're going to launch< launch 100 shares or shot 100 shares on launch 100 shares or shot 100 shares on an< an index ETF then good luck to you my an index ETF then good luck to you my friend< friend because you are going to be in friend because you are going to be in for< for a margin call right the broker is for a margin call right the broker is going< going to call you up and say send them going to call you up and say send them more< more money all right so if you want to more money all right so if you want to avoid< avoid this situation then you definitely avoid this situation then you definitely want< want to exit at 21 DTE which is much want to exit at 21 DTE which is much safer< safer which reduces your risk of early safer which reduces your risk of early assignment< assignment as well so as you can see assignment as well so as you can see down< down here here's another study done by down here here's another study done by the< the test trade team this is if you were the test trade team this is if you were to< to hold to expiration all right if you to hold to expiration all right if you hold< hold to expression you notice that the hold to expression you notice that the chances< chances of you actually hitting your max chances of you actually hitting your max loss< loss is higher right so this is the loss is higher right so this is the delta< delta wing so delta wing is the long delta wing so delta wing is the long option< option on both sides so they tested option on both sides so they tested between< between 13 between 13 um 10< um 10 and 5 Deltas for the long options um 10 and 5 Deltas for the long options on< on both sides so as you can see if you on both sides so as you can see if you hold< hold to expiration the chances of you hold to expiration the chances of you actually< actually reaching the max loss is pretty actually reaching the max loss is pretty high< high right 15 Deltas that means it's high right 15 Deltas that means it's closer< closer to the short call if a 6. 4 chance closer to the short call if a 6.

4 chance all< all the way to 1. 2 percent chance but if all the way to 1.

2 percent chance but if you< you were to exit at 21 DTE look at this you were to exit at 21 DTE look at this right< right something magical happens. all of a right something magical happens all of a sudden< sudden the chances of you hitting your sudden the chances of you hitting your max< max loss has dropped to 0. 4 percent and max loss has dropped to 0.

4 percent and if< if you have a 5 Delta long option right if you have a 5 Delta long option right on< on the both sides and guess what it on the both sides and guess what it becomes< becomes zero percent right this is from becomes zero percent right this is from the< the index ETF by the way so as you can the index ETF by the way so as you can see< see if you want to actually trade the see if you want to actually trade the iron< iron Condor it's much better for you to iron Condor it's much better for you to exit< exit at 21 DT rather than whole to exit at 21 DT rather than whole to expiration< expiration by the way if you like this expiration by the way if you like this video< video. then you're absolutely going to video then you're absolutely going to love< love this next video which I have for love this next video which I have for you< you so go ahead and watch that video you so go ahead and watch that video right< right now also if you have already right now also if you have already gotten< gotten your free copy of the options gotten your free copy of the options income< income blueprint you can do so just by income blueprint you can do so just by clicking< clicking this link down here on your clicking this link down here on your screen< screen and you'll be able to get it for screen and you'll be able to get it for free< free all right I will see you in the free all right I will see you in the next<

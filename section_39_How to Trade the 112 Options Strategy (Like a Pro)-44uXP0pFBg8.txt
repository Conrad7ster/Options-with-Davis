==================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about a pretty we're going to be talking about a pretty interesting< interesting strategy and it's called the interesting strategy and it's called the 112< 112 option strategy so I've had a number 112 option strategy so I've had a number of< of people that actually reached out to of people that actually reached out to me< me and to ask me to actually cover this me and to ask me to actually cover this strategy< strategy right so at first I didn't strategy right so at first I didn't exactly< exactly know what is this 112 option exactly know what is this 112 option strategy< strategy because it is not that of a strategy because it is not that of a mainstream< mainstream kind of a strategy because if mainstream kind of a strategy because if you< you notice the other strategy names uh you notice the other strategy names uh they< they actually have a name like iron they actually have a name like iron Condor< Condor credit spread so on and so forth Condor credit spread so on and so forth right< right this is the only strategy that has right this is the only strategy that has a< a number involved to it so I was curious a number involved to it so I was curious to< to actually find out what exactly is to actually find out what exactly is this< this option strategy so I did a deep this option strategy so I did a deep Research< Research into this and here this video Research into this and here this video I'm< I'm going to go to do a deep dive into I'm going to go to do a deep dive into this< this right I'm going to get into what this right I'm going to get into what exactly< exactly is this one2 strategy uh whether exactly is this one2 strategy uh whether you< you should trade it and if you choose to you should trade it and if you choose to how< how to trade it as well all right so how to trade it as well all right so let's< let's Dive Right In so first of all what let's Dive Right In so first of all what exactly< exactly is this 112 strategy right what exactly is this 112 strategy right what is< is this one2 method so this strategy uh is this one2 method so this strategy uh basically< basically this number one2 coincides basically this number one2 coincides with< with the uh legs that you have right with the uh legs that you have right what< what kind of options that you have for what kind of options that you have for each< each of this right so for example this each of this right so for example this method< method consists of one long put that is method consists of one long put that is out< out of the money so as you can see here out of the money so as you can see here out< out of the money again for the put side out of the money again for the put side is< is anything that is below the current is anything that is below the current market< market price right so down here you have market price right so down here you have the< the current price so anything below that the current price so anything below that is< is called out of the money so you have is called out of the money so you have one< one long put that is out of the money one long put that is out of the money and< and then you short a put option that is and then you short a put option that is below< below this long put so it's further out below this long put so it's further out of< of the money and then you have two short of the money and then you have two short puts< puts that is very far out of the money puts that is very far out of the money right< right so just from this alone you notice right so just from this alone you notice that< that this construct has actually three that this construct has actually three short< short puts right three short puts and short puts right three short puts and one< one long put now if you were to just one long put now if you were to just look< look at this people might get a little look at this people might get a little bit< bit confused right how come there's bit confused right how come there's three< three short puts right and it seems kind three short puts right and it seems kind of< of uh dangerous to have that many short of uh dangerous to have that many short puts< puts. in one strategy so I want you to puts in one strategy so I want you to think< think of it as this right just think of think of it as this right just think of it< it as two short puts that is financing a it as two short puts that is financing a long< long putut spread right so basically long putut spread right so basically from< from this two short puts down here so from this two short puts down here so what< what you're doing here is you're selling what you're doing here is you're selling the< the put options here to get some premium the put options here to get some premium right< right so you're going to get some right so you're going to get some premium< premium down here and with this premium premium down here and with this premium you're< you're going to actually purchase a put you're going to actually purchase a put debit< debit spread so this put debit spread is debit spread so this put debit spread is a< a little bit like a hedge right so if a little bit like a hedge right so if you< you think about this strategy it's very you think about this strategy it's very similar< similar to the put ratio spread right so similar to the put ratio spread right so the< the put ratio spread is basically the put ratio spread is basically something< something like this right so the put something like this right so the put ratio< ratio spread does not have this two ratio spread does not have this two short< short put out of the money right there short put out of the money right there further< further out the money instead down here further out the money instead down here you< you have two short puts right so this is you have two short puts right so this is the< the put ratio spread now the other way the put ratio spread now the other way to< to do the put ratio spread is that you to do the put ratio spread is that you can< can actually spread out the short putut can actually spread out the short putut right< right so for example you don't need to right so for example you don't need to have< have two short puts at one place so have two short puts at one place so instead< instead again let me just remove this so instead again let me just remove this so instead< instead maybe you have another one put instead maybe you have another one put option< option down down here right so if you option down down here right so if you have< have one put option down here down here have one put option down here down here this< this one will already give you some this one will already give you some premium< premium with this premium again you premium with this premium again you finance< finance the debit spread right the put finance the debit spread right the put debit< debit spread so as you can see it's debit spread so as you can see it's pretty< pretty similar now why is there two pretty similar now why is there two short< short puts down here instead of one so short puts down here instead of one so the< the whole idea with this strategy is the whole idea with this strategy is that< that it's trying to get a high win rate that it's trying to get a high win rate a< a high probability of win rate and that a high probability of win rate and that is< is why he trying to go with a short is why he trying to go with a short putut< putut that is very very far out of the putut that is very very far out of the money< money right so let's say for example money right so let's say for example this< this current put ratio down here right this current put ratio down here right this< this is a put ratio spread where you this is a put ratio spread where you have< have the short puts that is split up have the short puts that is split up right< right one slightly forther of the money right one slightly forther of the money now< now with this down here this premium now with this down here this premium which< which you receive could very nice just which you receive could very nice just be< be able to finance this put spread right be able to finance this put spread right let's< let's say for example you get $2 for let's say for example you get $2 for this< this okay so if you get $2 for this this okay so if you get $2 for this maybe< maybe you can buy a put spread down here maybe you can buy a put spread down here that< that cost roughly about $1. 50 right so that cost roughly about $1.

50 right so the< the spillover is a net positive postive the spillover is a net positive postive of< of a 50 cents credit for this put ratio of a 50 cents credit for this put ratio spread< spread now what this strategy is trying spread now what this strategy is trying to< to do is that it wants to push this to do is that it wants to push this short< short put out because it wants to get a short put out because it wants to get a higher< higher win rate right so maybe down here higher win rate right so maybe down here this< this might be somewhere around 20 Deltas this might be somewhere around 20 Deltas so< so 20 Deltas would be closer to the so 20 Deltas would be closer to the market< market compared to the one down here so market compared to the one down here so based< based on this strategy what they're based on this strategy what they're really< really trying to do is to go for a very really trying to do is to go for a very very< very far out the money Delta a very very very far out the money Delta a very very low< low Delta of somewhere around five low Delta of somewhere around five Deltas< Deltas to 10 Deltas right because if you Deltas to 10 Deltas right because if you go< go very very far out of the money with 5 go very very far out of the money with 5 to< to 10 Deltas so what happens is that now to 10 Deltas so what happens is that now you< you. have a higher win rate right because you have a higher win rate right because the< the chances of the market coming down to the chances of the market coming down to test< test this short putut is not as high so test this short putut is not as high so let< let me just remove all this drawing let me just remove all this drawing again< again just to make it even clearer so again just to make it even clearer so again< again we have the one shot put down here again we have the one shot put down here for< for the normal put ratio spread for the normal put ratio spread now< now the problem with this is that when now the problem with this is that when you< you try to push it out down here and you try to push it out down here and let's< let's say you only have one put option let's say you only have one put option down< down here the problem down here is that down here the problem down here is that you< you might not actually get that much you might not actually get that much credit< credit right so the credit maybe this credit right so the credit maybe this time< time would be only time would be only A1< A1 20 so you notice that a120 and you A1 20 so you notice that a120 and you want< want to buy this one down here and this want to buy this one down here and this one< one let's say for example again is still one let's say for example again is still at< at $1. 50 you can't get a good enough at $1.

50 you can't get a good enough credit< credit right because you have pushed it credit right because you have pushed it to< to far away so in order to compensate to far away so in order to compensate this< this what they do is they sell two short this what they do is they sell two short puts< puts so this way now instead of getting puts so this way now instead of getting a120< a120 what you have right now will be a120 what you have right now will be $240< $240 so now you have much more premium $240 so now you have much more premium to< to finance this uh put debit spread that to finance this uh put debit spread that you're< you're going to buy so this is the whole you're going to buy so this is the whole idea< idea of this strategy right you're idea of this strategy right you're adding< adding the additional short put so that adding the additional short put so that you< you can go much further out the money you can go much further out the money increase< increase your probability of profit but increase your probability of profit but the< the downside to this is that you the downside to this is that you actually< actually also increase your risk because actually also increase your risk because right< right now you don't just have one short right now you don't just have one short put< put you have two short puts right so put you have two short puts. right so that< that is double the risk so this is the that is double the risk so this is the whole< whole strategy that this 112 is all whole strategy that this 112 is all about< about so this is a premium selling about so this is a premium selling strategy< strategy that has a very high win rate strategy that has a very high win rate so< so the next question you might be so the next question you might be wondering< wondering is should you actually trade wondering is should you actually trade the< the 112 strategy by the way if you like the 112 strategy by the way if you like this< this video so far Please Subscribe and this video so far Please Subscribe and also< also click the thumbs up button and also also click the thumbs up button and also do< do get your free copy of the options do get your free copy of the options income< income blueprint where I share the top income blueprint where I share the top three< three options strategies that help you three options strategies that help you generate< generate a consistent income each month generate a consistent income each month trading< trading just one to two hours a day trading just one to two hours a day right< right so if you want to go ahead to get right so if you want to go ahead to get this< this copy just head on over to options this copy just head on over to options with< with davis. com blueprint all right back with davis.

com blueprint all right back to< to the video so in order for you to to the video so in order for you to understand< understand whether you should trade this understand whether you should trade this strategy< strategy you need to First understand strategy you need to First understand the< the pros and cons of this method right the pros and cons of this method right so< so let's start off with the pros so the so let's start off with the pros so the pros< pros. of the 11 two strategy there are a pros of the 11 two strategy there are a few< few of them so the first one is that you few of them so the first one is that you have< have a very high win rate right so as have a very high win rate right so as you< you can see down here this one that I've you can see down here this one that I've constructed< constructed is above 95% right constructed is above 95% right 95. 8%< 95.

8% right in certain cases you can go 95. 8% right in certain cases you can go even< even higher than that but what that even higher than that but what that means< means is that you really need to push means is that you really need to push your< your two short puts which is down here your two short puts which is down here much< much further out of the money right so much further out of the money right so you're< you're going to go even further out in you're going to go even further out in order< order for you to get a very very high order for you to get a very very high win< win rate so this is one of the row of win rate so this is one of the row of the< the 112 strategy right so most of the the 112 strategy right so most of the time< time you put on you're going to be time you put on you're going to be profitable< profitable and because you have a very profitable and because you have a very high< high win rate this also leads to having high win rate this also leads to having a< a very short losing streak so this is a very short losing streak so this is very< very important to understand as well very important to understand as well because< because when I'm looking at any strategy because when I'm looking at any strategy I< I also want to understand the losing I also want to understand the losing streaks< streaks that's involved with the streaks that's involved with the strategy< strategy right because we humans we just strategy right because we humans we just like< like to win uh most of the time right if like to win uh most of the time right if we< we don't win we're going to feel we don't win we're going to feel affected< affected by it so if you have a very affected by it so if you have a very high< high win rate it it also means that your high win rate it it also means that your losing< losing streaks is going to be very very losing streaks is going to be very very short< short so over here I have the short so over here I have the probability< probability table so basically what this probability table so basically what this table< table is showing is the probability of X table is showing is the probability of X consecutive< consecutive losing trades within a 100 consecutive losing trades within a 100 Trade< Trade sequence So within a 100 trades Trade sequence So within a 100 trades how< how many consecutive losers you will how many consecutive losers you will have< have in a row so because this strategy have in a row so because this strategy has< has a win rate of above 90% so we're has a win rate of above 90% so we're looking< looking at the one that I've already looking at the one that I've already highlighted< highlighted in blue right so as you can highlighted in blue right so as you can see< see down here at 90% And see down here at 90% And 95%< 95% the chances of you getting four 95% the chances of you getting four losses< losses in a row is very little right losses in a row is very little right it's< it's anywhere from 0% to 1% so basically it's anywhere from 0% to 1% so basically it's< it's very improbable which also means it's very improbable which also means that< that you already know what to expect that you already know what to expect upfront< upfront from the strategy right you know upfront from the strategy right you know that< that you will unlikely get four losses that you will unlikely get four losses in< in a row so if you're going to get up to in a row so if you're going to get up to two< two losses in a row or three losses in a two losses in a row or three losses in a row< row you know that you're still within row you know that you're still within the< the boundaries of this strategy working the boundaries of this strategy working right< right only if you get about four losses right only if you get about four losses in< in a row onwards then you know that in a row onwards then you know that maybe< maybe something is not right right maybe maybe something is not right right maybe you< you have done something wrong but for you have done something wrong but for the< the most part it should be only up to the most part it should be only up to three< three losses in a row and if you get a three losses in a row and if you get a 95%< 95% construct you notice that generally 95% construct you notice that generally you< you will get up to only two losses in a you will get up to only two losses in a row< row because the three losses in a row is row because the three losses in a row is about< about 1% right not that it won't happen about 1% right not that it won't happen it's< it's just that it's very very improbable it's just that it's very very improbable so< so if you like to win most of the time so if you like to win most of the time you< you like to have a profitable trade most you like to have a profitable trade most of< of the time and you don't like to see of the time and you don't like to see draw< draw Downs then this is a strategy that draw Downs then this is a strategy that you< you know you can certainly consider now you know you can certainly consider now the< the third Pro is that this strategy is the third Pro is that this strategy is omnidirectional< omnidirectional so it's very similar to omnidirectional so it's very similar to the< the put ratio spread right in the sense the put ratio spread right in the sense whereby< whereby you can make money regardless if whereby you can make money regardless if the< the market goes up or down right so as the market goes up or down right so as you< you can see down here this is where the you can see down here this is where the current< current market price is if the market current market price is if the market goes< goes up you're going to make a profit goes up you're going to make a profit because< because you have the credit from you because you have the credit from you know< know creating this structure in the know creating this structure in the first< first place right this is a premium first place right this is a premium. selling< selling strategy so you just get the selling strategy so you just get the minimum< minimum premium and if the market goes minimum premium and if the market goes down< down as long as it stays above this down as long as it stays above this break< break even Zone at expiration then break even Zone at expiration then you're< you're going to be in a profit as well you're going to be in a profit as well right< right and you can start to make slightly right and you can start to make slightly more< more if it starts to go inside this more if it starts to go inside this profit< profit Zone down here so this is the max profit Zone down here so this is the max profit< profit zone so as you can see if the profit zone so as you can see if the market< market goes up you make the minimum market goes up you make the minimum credit< credit if the market goes down you have credit if the market goes down you have the< the opportunity to make slightly more the opportunity to make slightly more than< than a minimum credit and it's a pretty than a minimum credit and it's a pretty you< you know big room so the market goes up you know big room so the market goes up or< or down you can make profit just that or down you can make profit just that you< you don't want the market to go too far you don't want the market to go too far down< down right past this break even Point down right past this break even Point down< down here so if you go past this break down here so if you go past this break even< even point this is where you start to even point this is where you start to lose< lose money now that we know the pros of lose money now that we know the pros of this< this strategy let's get into the cons so this strategy let's get into the cons so the< the cons the very first one is the loss the cons the very first one is the loss right< right because you have two short puts right because you have two short puts right< right now so your loss really increases right now so your loss really increases rapidly< rapidly as the market keeps going down rapidly as the market keeps going down right< right so if the market keeps going down right so if the market keeps going down you< you can see that this is a pretty stick you can see that this is a pretty stick decline< decline down here where you start to decline down here where you start to lose< lose pretty quickly now the next con is lose pretty quickly now the next con is that< that this is pretty Capital intensive that this is pretty Capital intensive because< because there's two naked puts right because there's two naked puts right there's< there's two naked puts and as you can there's two naked puts and as you can see< see down here I'm using this on the iwm see down here I'm using this on the iwm right< right if you use this on the iwm you right if you use this on the iwm you notice< notice that the buying power effect is notice that the buying power effect is roughly< roughly about roughly about $3,442< $3,442 so if you have a small account $3,442 so if you have a small account let's< let's say for example you only have let's say for example you only have $5,000< $5,000 to start off with then this $5,000 to start off with then this strategy< strategy will definitely be a little bit strategy will definitely be a little bit too< too big for your account now you might too big for your account now you might be< be thinking hey you know you could just be thinking hey you know you could just go< go for a cheaper stock so this way your go for a cheaper stock so this way your buying< buying power effect is lower but one buying power effect is lower but one issue< issue is that it can be difficult to issue is that it can be difficult to construct< construct on lower price stock because construct on lower price stock because it< it has very large intervals between the it has very large intervals between the strikes< strikes so as you can see down here the strikes so as you can see down here the very< very first one at the top this is very first one at the top this is Starbucks< Starbucks right so Starbucks is roughly Starbucks right so Starbucks is roughly about< about 90 odd dollars but at 90 odd about 90 odd dollars but at 90 odd dollars< dollars you notice your interval is $5 dollars you notice your interval is $5 wide< wide right as you can see down here 90 wide right as you can see down here 90 to< to 85 to 80 to 75 these are $5 wide so to 85 to 80 to 75 these are $5 wide so if< if it's $5 wide it's going to be very if it's $5 wide it's going to be very difficult< difficult for you to construct this 112 difficult for you to construct this 112 strategy< strategy so if you just take a look at a strategy so if you just take a look at a very< very simple example down here so let's very simple example down here so let's say< say for example let's take a look at the say for example let's take a look at the 80< 80 strike to sell the two shot puts you 80 strike to sell the two shot puts you notice< notice that this is at 9 Delta which is notice that this is at 9 Delta which is roughly< roughly what the strategy is selling the roughly what the strategy is selling the puts< puts at around 5 to 10 Deltas so if you puts at around 5 to 10 Deltas so if you were< were to sell this and let's say for were to sell this and let's say for example< example you get about 50 cents per example you get about 50 cents per shotput< shotput so you're going to only get a shotput so you're going to only get a credit< credit of a doll and let's say you're credit of a doll and let's say you're going< going to buy the put spread of 90 and 85 going to buy the put spread of 90 and 85 so< so 90 and 85 you just take the so 90 and 85 you just take the difference< difference right you can see the mark difference right you can see the mark for< for the 90 is $2.

60 and the mark for the for the 90 is $2. 60 and the mark for the 85< 85 strike price is4 so you take $260 85 strike price is4 so you take $260 minus minus minus 1< 1 is roughly about 1 is roughly about a146< a146 so that way exceeds the a dollar a146 so that way exceeds the a dollar credit< credit that you're getting so that means credit that you're getting so that means that< that it will actually be a debit so in that it will actually be a debit so in order< order for you to do this strategy you order for you to do this strategy you may< may need to go for something like the may need to go for something like. the 113< 113 or the 114 where you're going to 113 or the 114 where you're going to have< have three or four short puts so as you have three or four short puts so as you can< can see it's not that feasible same same can see it's not that feasible same same thing< thing as well for Nike Nike is about thing as well for Nike Nike is about $100< $100 at this point in time and if you $100 at this point in time and if you want< want to construct this as well you want to construct this as well you notice< notice that the intervals is about notice that the intervals is about $22.

50< $22. 50 slightly better than Starbucks $22.

50 slightly better than Starbucks but< but then again it's a little bit too but then again it's a little bit too wide< wide as well to construct this one2 wide as well to construct this one2 strategy< strategy properly so now that you know strategy properly so now that you know the< the pros and cons should you actually the pros and cons should you actually trade< trade this strategy so this really comes trade this strategy so this really comes down< down to you and whether you're down to you and whether you're comfortable< comfortable with the risk associated comfortable with the risk associated with< with this strategy now if you have with this strategy now if you have already< already decided to trade this strategy already decided to trade this strategy then< then I'm going to share with you a few then I'm going to share with you a few simple< simple steps on how you can actually simple steps on how you can actually trade< trade this strategy so the very first trade this strategy so the very first step< step is to choose the closest to the 45 step is to choose the closest to the 45 DTE< DTE exploration and again we want to DTE exploration and again we want to choose< choose around the 45 DTE because Studies choose around the 45 DTE because Studies have< have shown this is the DTE that we have have shown this is the DTE that we have the< the edge whereby the realized move is the edge whereby the realized move is most< most often the time going to be lesser most often the time going to be lesser than< than the expected move so if you're not than the expected move so if you're not sure< sure what this is again just go ahead to sure what this is again just go ahead to my< my channel and I talk about this my channel and I talk about this expected< expected move in depth in another my expected move in depth in another my video< video called the number one secret to video called the number one secret to becoming< becoming consistently profitable trading becoming consistently profitable trading options< options now step number two is to choose options now step number two is to choose two< two shot puts at around 5 to 10 Deltas two shot puts at around 5 to 10 Deltas so< so as you can see down here we have a so as you can see down here we have a pretty< pretty wide range of uh strikes that we pretty wide range of uh strikes that we can< can choose from now step number three can choose from now step number three this< this is where you want to construct your this is where you want to construct your put< put spread right so you've already got put spread right so you've already got the< the two short puts you want to take a the. two short puts you want to take a look< look at the kind of credit that you're look at the kind of credit that you're receiving< receiving so once you've got the credit receiving so once you've got the credit you< you already know how much you have in you already know how much you have in terms< terms of the premium you collected terms of the premium you collected then< then you can calculate as well you know then you can calculate as well you know how< how wide of a put spread you can how wide of a put spread you can actually< actually put on right how big of a put actually put on right how big of a put spread< spread you can actually purchase and spread you can actually purchase and this< this is where you want to you know just this is where you want to you know just play< play around with the strikes so play around with the strikes so basically< basically for the long putut you want it basically for the long putut you want it anywhere< anywhere from 25 to 45 Deltas right so anywhere from 25 to 45 Deltas right so 45< 45 Deltas that means that your max 45 Deltas that means that your max profit< profit Zone will be closer to where the profit Zone will be closer to where the current< current at the money is but that also current at the money is but that also means< means that you will collect slightly means that you will collect slightly lesser< lesser credit up front and if you go for lesser credit up front and if you go for for< for the one that's slightly further away for the one that's slightly further away from< from the markets maybe somewhere around from the markets maybe somewhere around 25< 25 Delta then you're going to get 25 Delta then you're going to get slightly< slightly more credit but your max profit slightly more credit but your max profit Zone< Zone will only be much lower so step Zone will only be much lower so step number< number four this is where you want to number four this is where you want to try< try out the different put spread strikes try out the different put spread strikes to< to find your desired construct so for to find your desired construct so for example< example down here you can see that I example down here you can see that I chose< chose the 19594 as well as the two short chose the 19594 as well as the two short puts< puts is at 170 right so I use the two puts is at 170 right so I use the two shot< shot foots at 170 to finance this uh put shot foots at 170 to finance this uh put debit< debit spread at 19514 for and you can debit spread at 19514 for and you can see< see the credit that's received is about. see the credit that's received is about.

73< 73 cents or about 73 cents or about $73< $73 now you want to try and shift the $73 now you want to try and shift the strikes< strikes a little bit again and then see strikes a little bit again and then see what< what you can get so for this time we try what you can get so for this time we try out< out a twoo wide debit spread so as you out a twoo wide debit spread so as you can< can see down here this is from 195 to can see down here this is from 195 to 193< 193 and for this we get a slightly lower 193 and for this we get a slightly lower credit< credit we have about 30 cents which is credit we have about. 30 cents which is $30< $30 that means to say that if the market $30 that means to say that if the market goes< goes above this 1 195 long put strike goes above this 1 195 long put strike right< right then you're just only going to get right then you're just only going to get $30< $30 right which is the minimum but if it $30 right which is the minimum but if it goes< goes below5 and let's say it stays there goes below5 and let's say it stays there at< at expiration then you'll get much more at expiration then you'll get much more right< right the max profit will be the uh Max right the max profit will be the uh Max profit< profit of this credit spread which is 2. profit of this credit spread which is 2.

white< white and that is equal to $200 so $200 white and that is equal to $200 so $200 plus< plus $30 for the premium you receive up plus $30 for the premium you receive up front< front is about front is about $230< $230 next you can try out also a put $230 next you can try out also a put debit< debit spread that is further out of the debit spread that is further out of the money< money right so in this case you can see money right so in this case you can see that< that I've constructed the thre point that I've constructed the thre point wide< wide deit spread and you can only do wide deit spread and you can only do this< this if you go further out of the money this if you go further out of the money because< because the strikes are cheaper right if because the strikes are cheaper right if it's< it's cheaper you can construct a much it's cheaper you can construct a much wider< wider profit zone for the debit spread wider profit zone for the debit spread so< so as you can see down here this is2 to so as you can see down here this is2 to 189< 189 and the credit that you receive is 189 and the credit that you receive is $18< $18 so you get very little upfront but $18 so you get very little upfront but if< if the market goes down below 192 to 189 if the market goes down below 192 to 189 189< 189 past 189 will be where your max 189 past 189 will be where your max profit< profit is but anyway past2 you will get profit is but anyway past2 you will get more< more than the minimum profit so for this more than the minimum profit so for this your< your max profit will be $300 plus the your max profit will be $300 plus the $18< $18 which is $18 which is $318< $318 now what if you go for a put debit $318 now what if you go for a put debit spread< spread that is much much further out of spread that is much much further out of the< the money right so in this case you can the money right so in this case you can see< see I used the see I used the 19189< 19189 so for this what you're doing is 19189 so for this what you're doing is that< that you're slightly more bullish that you're slightly more bullish whereby< whereby you get much more credit up whereby you get much more credit up front< front as you can see you get $89 up front as you can see you get $89 up front< front and if the market goes down below1 front and if the market goes down below1 189< 189 then your max profit will be only 189 then your max profit will be only about< about $189 so as you can see down here about $189 so as you can see down here there's< there's a lot of tinkering around with there's a lot of tinkering around with the< the strikes right you just have to shift the strikes right you just have to shift it< it here and there and then find out one it here and there and then find out one that< that is comfortable for you right which that is comfortable for you right which you< you feel is the construct that you want you feel is the construct that you want right< right so for example if you're a little right so for example if you're a little bit< bit more bullish then you may want to go bit more bullish then you may want to go with< with one that has slightly higher. credit with one that has slightly higher credit if< if you're slightly more bearish then you if you're slightly more bearish then you want< want to go with one where there is a want to go with one where there is a wider< wider put debit spread so this way if wider put debit spread so this way if the< the market goes down at least you have a the market goes down at least you have a bigger< bigger protection to the downside with bigger protection to the downside with the< the higher profit from the put debit the higher profit from the put debit spread< spread now once you're satisfied with spread now once you're satisfied with this< this construct the last step is to this construct the last step is to submit< submit your order as a single order submit your order as a single order ticket< ticket so this is very important because ticket so this is very important because some< some people have asked me whether it's some people have asked me whether it's possible< possible to split up the strategy so possible to split up the strategy so basically< basically split up by selling the short basically split up by selling the short put< put first and if the market goes higher put first and if the market goes higher then< then you go and buy the put deit spread then you go and buy the put deit spread and< and while you can certainly do that but and while you can certainly do that but you< you need to understand that there'll be you need to understand that there'll be leing< leing risk right because if for example leing risk right because if for example you< you sell the shop foot the market goes you sell the shop foot the market goes down< down then you're going to be you know uh down then you're going to be you know uh short< short changing yourself because you're short changing yourself because you're going< going to buy a debit spread that is much going to buy a debit spread that is much lower< lower when we could actually got it lower when we could actually got it higher< higher all right so this is the 112 higher all right so this is the 112 option< option strategy what do you think about option strategy what do you think about it< it and do you think you're going to it and do you think you're going to trade< trade it do let me know in the comments trade it do let me know in the comments below< below I'd love to hear what you think below

find in this list so you will not< not find any of those High impli not find any of those High impli volatility< volatility stocks inside here right so volatility stocks inside here right so maybe<

trading< trading options you should be avoiding trading options you should be avoiding those< those stocks like the plague so if you those stocks like the plague so if you shouldn't< shouldn't be trading this stocks then shouldn't be trading this stocks then what< what stock should you be trading if what stock should you be trading if you're< you're ready let's dive right into the you're ready let's dive right into the very< very first one and that is none other very first one and that is none other than< than spy so technically spy is not a than spy so technically spy is not a stock< stock it is a basket of stock which is stock it is a basket of stock which is the< the index ETF in fact I will even go the index ETF in fact I will even go further< further to say that you know if you have further to say that you know if you have not< not been consistently getting you know not been consistently getting you know good< good results so far in your trading then good results so far in your trading then you< you might want to consider trading just you might want to consider trading just spy< spy alone because if you trade it the spy alone because if you trade it the right< right way with the right mechanics you right way with the right mechanics you can< can become consistently profitable so can become consistently profitable so before< before I get into the option strategies before I get into the option strategies I< I want to first talk about why you want I want to first talk about why you want to< to trade spy so the very first reason is to trade spy so the very first reason is that< that this is a positive drift vehicle that this is a positive drift vehicle what< what do you mean by positive drift what do you mean by positive drift positive< positive drift just means that the positive drift just means that the underlying< underlying just wants to go up over the underlying just wants to go up over the long< long term and this is true for the long term and this is true for the broad-based< broad-based index ETF so in this case broad-based index ETF so in this case spy< spy as you can see over here spy has spy as you can see over here spy has actually< actually gone through quite a number of actually gone through quite a number of Market< Market crashes right it has been Market crashes right it has been incepted< incepted for quite a number of years incepted for quite a number of years already< already you can see over here in 2000 already you can see over here in 2000 there's< there's this dotom bubble where the there's this dotom bubble where the market< market came down and then again in 2008 market came down and then again in 2008 the< the great financial crisis Market came the great financial crisis Market came down< down and then even in 2020 there the down and then even in 2020 there the pandemic< pandemic Market came down and then in pandemic Market came down and then in 2022< 2022 there's the bare market and still 2022 there's the bare market and still many< many more other events during this years many more other events during this years that< that would have caused a down movement that would have caused a down movement in< in the underline but in the long term in the underline but in the long term you< you notice that it just kept making new you notice that it just kept making new highs< highs so why is this important because highs so why is this important because if< if you know the buyers is towards the if you know the buyers is towards the upside< upside then you can position your upside then you can position your strategies< strategies to capture you know this strategies to capture you know this biasness< biasness to the upside now the second biasness to the upside now the second reason< reason and a very important one as well reason and a very important one as well is< is that the Studies have shown that the is that the Studies have shown that the RM< RM is less than em now you might be RM is less than em now you might be wondering< wondering Davis what is RM less than Em wondering Davis what is RM less than Em are< are you saying that my my relationship are you saying that my my relationship manager< manager is less than my elderly mother manager is less than my elderly mother what< what no what I'm talking about is that what no what I'm talking about is that the< the realized move is less than the the realized move is less than the expected< expected move and in fact I've got a expected move and in fact I've got a whole< whole video just to talk about this whole video just to talk about this basically< basically this is our Edge in options so basically this is our Edge in options so let< let me show you what I mean over here so let me show you what I mean over here so as< as you can see this is a table a as you can see this is a table a research< research done by the tasty trade team research done by the tasty trade team where< where they measured the actual movement where they measured the actual movement in< in the market which is the average in the market which is the average realized< realized Move versus the theoretical realized Move versus the theoretical movement< movement so this is the move or rather movement so this is the move or rather the< the range of movement that's calculated the range of movement that's calculated out< out uh basically trying to predict what out uh basically trying to predict what is< is the actual move in the market but as is the actual move in the market but as you< you can see over here there's some you can see over here there's some discrepancy< discrepancy so the average expected move discrepancy so the average expected move based< based on Theory the calculation is based on Theory the calculation is always< always more than the average realized always more than the average realized move< move over a period of time so as you can move over a period of time so as you can see< see even depending on the different see even depending on the different volatility< volatility levels you can see that the volatility levels you can see that the average< average expected move is always more average expected move is always more than< than the average realized move you can than the average realized move you can see< see over here when volatility is low see over here when volatility is low average< average expected move more than the average expected move more than the average< average realized move and when the average realized move and when the volatility< volatility is very high same thing as volatility is very high same thing as well< well and in fact this Edge that we have well and in fact this Edge that we have down< down here RM less than em is much more down here RM less than em is much more pronounced< pronounced in the index ETF than the pronounced in the index ETF than the individual< individual stocks and these are the individual stocks and these are the studies< studies that have already been done by studies that have already been done by the< the tasty trade team as spell so that is the tasty trade team as spell so that is why< why we also want to trade spy because of why we also want to trade spy because of this< this so if you're not very familiar this so if you're not very familiar about< about this whole concept I would suggest about this whole concept I would suggest that< that you familiarize yourself with it that you familiarize yourself with it because< because it is very important and it's because it is very important and it's our< our Edge when we're trading options so our Edge when we're trading options so I've< I've already created a whole video I've already created a whole video regarding< regarding this and the title is the regarding this and the title is the number< number one secret to becoming number one secret to becoming consistently< consistently profitable trading options consistently profitable trading options so< so just hit on to my channel and look so just hit on to my channel and look for< for this video now the final reason why for this video now the final reason why we< we want to trade spy is because the we want to trade spy is because the tasty< tasty trade team they have already tasty trade team they have already tested< tested multiple option strategies on spy tested multiple option strategies on spy and< and they have been proven profitable so and they have been proven profitable so as< as you can see your over here this is as you can see your over here this is the< the short putut the short putut on the the short putut the short putut on the Spy< Spy over the long term is going to be Spy over the long term is going to be profitable< profitable as you can see this study is profitable as you can see this study is across< across a few years right you can see across a few years right you can see it's< it's from 2006 all the way past pandemic it's from 2006 all the way past pandemic so< so that's more than a decade so this so that's more than a decade so this study< study down here is pretty statistically study down here is pretty statistically significant< significant so one thing you notice is significant so one thing you notice is that< that you do have losing years and this that you do have losing years and this is< is normal guys you cannot find a is normal guys you cannot find a strategy< strategy that's going to be profitable strategy that's going to be profitable every< every single year right so as you can every single year right so as you can see< see over here in 2008 when there's the see over here in 2008 when there's the financial< financial crisis the short putut will be financial crisis the short putut will be losing< losing money but again over the long losing money but again over the long term< term after that when the market recovers term after that when the market recovers the< the strategy recovers as well now next the strategy recovers as well now next is< is the put spread and as you can see is the put spread and as you can see same< same thing as well regardless whether same thing as well regardless whether you< you are managing it at 21 DTE or holding you are managing it at 21 DTE or holding the< the trade already to expiration you're the trade already to expiration you're going< going to be net profitable over the long going to be net profitable over the long term< term next is the fancy SMY strangle so term next is the fancy SMY strangle so this< this is something that the tasty trade this is something that the tasty trade team< team really love to test test on and team really love to test test on and they< they have done extensive test on the spy they have done extensive test on the spy with< with this strangle and as you can see as with this strangle and as you can see as well< well it is net profitable over the well it is net profitable over the longterm< longterm and next is the iron Condor as longterm and next is the iron Condor as you< you can see over here they tested the 20 you can see over here they tested the 20 Delta< Delta $10 wide iron Condor and they Delta $10 wide iron Condor and they tested< tested it across two different tested it across two different management< management style you have one whereby management style you have one whereby once< once you put on the trade you exit at 21 once you put on the trade you exit at 21 days< days to expiration that means there's 31 days to expiration that means there's 31 days< days left to the expiration of the days left to the expiration of the option< option you exit the trade you put it on option you exit the trade you put it on again< again and the one at the bottom down again and the one at the bottom down here< here is basically just to leave the here is basically just to leave the trade< trade all the way to expiration and once trade all the way to expiration and once it< it expires you put on another trade it expires you put on another trade again< again and in the long term both are again and in the long term both are profitable< profitable as you can see however if you profitable as you can see however if you were< were to hold all the way to expiration were to hold all the way to expiration you< you kind of have you know not too good you kind of have you know not too good. of< of a result from 2011 all the way to of a result from 2011 all the way to 2017< 2017 and slightly past that so you 2017 and slightly past that so you definitely< definitely want to take note of this definitely want to take note of this especially< especially if you are trading the iron especially if you are trading the iron Condor< Condor but again in the long term it Condor but again in the long term it will< will still have The Edge and finally we will still have The Edge and finally we have< have the Jade lizard so Jade lizard is a have the Jade lizard so Jade lizard is a pretty< pretty fancy name but all it is is just pretty fancy name but all it is is just a< a combination of two strategies you have a combination of two strategies you have the< the short putut and you have the bare the short putut and you have the bare call< call spread when you combine them call spread when you combine them together< together this is what's called the Jade together this is what's called the Jade lizard< lizard and as you can see over here lizard and as you can see over here regardless< regardless if you manage it at 21 DTE or regardless if you manage it at 21 DTE or you< you hold to expiration it's still going you hold to expiration it's still going to< to be net profitable over the long term to be net profitable over the long term so< so this is actually a very important so this is actually a very important reason< reason why we want to trade spy because reason why we want to trade spy because the< the strategies have already been proven the strategies have already been proven profitable< profitable on spy so what option profitable on spy so what option strategies< strategies can you trade on spy so I've strategies can you trade on spy so I've already< already shown you in the previous slide already shown you in the previous slide those< those strategies that you can trade on those strategies that you can trade on spy< spy so basically you can trade the short spy so basically you can trade the short put< put so short put is the undefined risk put so short put is the undefined risk strategy< strategy now if you don't have enough strategy now if you don't have enough capital< capital or you don't have that big of a capital or you don't have that big of a account< account to put on the short putut then account to put on the short putut then you< you can put on the bull put spread so you can put on the bull put spread so basically< basically it's the put credit spread so basically it's the put credit spread so this< this way when you have this long put on this way when you have this long put on you< you have already defined your risk to you have already defined your risk to the< the downside whereby even if the market the downside whereby even if the market Market< Market you know really crashes past this Market you know really crashes past this long< long putut you don't really have to long putut you don't really have to worry< worry because you've already defined worry because you've already defined your< your max race so you cannot lose more your max race so you cannot lose more then< then the risk you've assigned to this then the risk you've assigned to this put< put spread now next you have the put spread now next you have the strangle< strangle as you have seen just now like strangle as you have seen just now like I< I mentioned tasty trade really love the I mentioned tasty trade really love the strangle< strangle strategy and again if you're strangle strategy and again if you're not< not able to put on the strangle on the not able to put on the strangle on the spine< spine then you can go for the defined spine then you can go for the defined risk< risk version which is the iron Condor so risk version which is the iron Condor so basically< basically the iron Condor and the basically the iron Condor and the strangle< strangle they aim to capture the profits strangle they aim to capture the profits inside< inside the strikes right as you can see inside the strikes right as you can see over< over here there is this big gap inside over here there is this big gap inside here< here so as long as the market pretty here so as long as the market pretty much< much stay within those short strikes you much stay within those short strikes you can< can be profitable next you have the jet can be profitable next you have the jet lizard< lizard so like I mentioned again jet lizard so like I mentioned again jet lizard< lizard very simple strategy if you think lizard very simple strategy if you think about< about it just a combination of two about it just a combination of two credit< credit strategies you have the short credit strategies you have the short putut< putut plus the bare call spread and this putut plus the bare call spread and this gives< gives you the Jade lizard so the way gives you the Jade lizard so the way that< that the Jade lizard is constructed is that the Jade lizard is constructed is whereby< whereby even if the market actually goes whereby even if the market actually goes past< past the cost past the cost you< you should still be profitable how does you should still be profitable how does this< this work so for example if your call this work so for example if your call spread< spread uh down here is about $2 white spread uh down here is about $2 white then< then the overall credit right that you then the overall credit right that you get< get for this Jade lizard should be more get for this Jade lizard should be more than< than $2 so let's say if you get $3 let's than $2 so let's say if you get $3 let's say< say for example you get $3 in terms of say for example you get $3 in terms of the< the credit in total then if the market the credit in total then if the market actually< actually goes past the call spread actually goes past the call spread you'll< you'll be losing the $2 on the call you'll be losing the $2 on the call spread< spread but you still have a spillover of spread but you still have a spillover of a< a dollar right so this this is how the a dollar right so this this is how the jet< jet lizard is constructed so it actually jet lizard is constructed so it actually has< has a pretty high wind rate now if has a pretty high wind rate now if you're< you're not able to put on the Jade you're not able to put on the Jade lizard< lizard which is the undefined RIS lizard which is the undefined RIS version< version then you can put on the defined version then you can put on the defined RIS< RIS version which I call it the Jade RIS version which I call it the Jade iron< iron Condor so now this name is not iron Condor so now this name is not something< something that you can find anywhere in something that you can find anywhere in fact< fact it's not an official name it's a fact it's not an official name it's a name< name that I actually came up with right name that I actually came up with right basically< basically if you think about it you look basically if you think about it you look at< at this structure it looks like an iron at this structure it looks like an iron cond< cond right you have a put spread at the cond right you have a put spread at the bottom< bottom you have the call spread at the bottom you have the call spread at the top< top and I just call it Jade because the top and I just call it Jade because the way< way that the J lizard is designed is way that the J lizard is designed is very< very similar to how the J iron Condor is very similar to how the J iron Condor is constructed< constructed as well whereby there is constructed as well whereby there is supposed< supposed to be no risk to the upside so supposed to be no risk to the upside so again< again the whole idea here is whereby the again the whole idea here is whereby the total< total credit that you receive for this total credit that you receive for this Jade< Jade iron Condor has to be more than the Jade iron Condor has to be more than the call< call spread withd over here number two call spread withd over here number two the< the next stock to trade is XSP and again the next stock to trade is XSP and again technically< technically not a stock it's a basket of technically not a stock it's a basket of stock< stock so XSP if you're not familiar with stock so XSP if you're not familiar with what< what this is is basically the cash what this is is basically the cash settled< settled version settled version of< of spy so in another sense it can be of spy so in another sense it can be considered< considered mini SPX so you may have considered mini SPX so you may have heard< heard of SPX before SPX is actually a heard of SPX before SPX is actually a much< much bigger product XSP is the smaller much bigger product XSP is the smaller product< product so if you're new to trading product so if you're new to trading options< options and you don't have that big of options and you don't have that big of an< an account size then I would strongly an account size then I would strongly suggest< suggest that you do not start off with suggest that you do not start off with the< the SPX because you know the risk is the SPX because you know the risk is going< going to be a bit higher down there okay going to be a bit higher down there okay so< so XSP why XSP so the same reasons as so XSP why XSP so the same reasons as spy< spy right because XSP basically is the spy right because XSP basically is the same< same same as Spy only difference is that same same as Spy only difference is that this< this is Cash settle index option so this is Cash settle index option so that's< that's the added benefit that it's cash that's the added benefit that it's cash settle< settle and by cash shle it just means settle and by cash shle it just means that< that there is no assignment of shares that there is no assignment of shares whatsoever< whatsoever so for example if you take a whatsoever so for example if you take a look< look at this screenshot over here you look at this screenshot over here you can< can see that upon exercise or assignment can see that upon exercise or assignment there's< there's no delivery of shares so you there's no delivery of shares so you don't< don't even have to worry about getting don't even have to worry about getting shares< shares because you know if you were to shares because you know if you were to trade< trade on spy and you get assigned shares trade on spy and you get assigned shares and< and you don't have the capital for that and you don't have the capital for that it's< it's going to get a little bit messy it's going to get a little bit messy right< right you're going to have margin cost right you're going to have margin cost all< all so on and so forth and you need to all so on and so forth and you need to kind< kind of unwind it but with the cash kind of unwind it but with the cash settle< settle index option like the XSP you settle index option like the XSP you don't< don't have this issue and you do not don't have this issue and you do not have< have early assignment as well which have early assignment as well which means< means to say you can hold all the way to means to say you can hold all the way to expiration< expiration so that is one of the reason expiration so that is one of the reason why< why cash SLE index options are actually why cash SLE index options are actually pretty< pretty popular with a lot of Traders pretty popular with a lot of Traders next< next possible faval tax treatment for next possible faval tax treatment for people< people in the US so this is taken from people in the US so this is taken from the< the CBOE website as you can see over the CBOE website as you can see over here< here under this role that says tax here under this role that says

com blueprint all right back to< to the video well basically it's the to the video well basically it's the same< same as spy in fact you can hold all the same as spy in fact you can hold all the way< way to expiration on the strategies that way to expiration on the strategies that I've< I've mentioned before so for example if I've mentioned before so for example if you< you want to trade the iron Condor you you want to trade the iron Condor you want< want to hold all the way to expl want to hold all the way to expl you< you can do that on XSP rather than spy you can do that on XSP rather than spy because< because you don't have to worry about because you don't have to worry about you< you know assignment of shares even you know assignment of shares even though< though your strikes are in the money and though your strikes are in the money and additionally< additionally you can trade the put ratio additionally you can trade the put ratio spread< spread as well and I must tell you I spread as well and I must tell you I love< love trading the put ratio spread so the love trading the put ratio spread so the put< put ratio spread if you're not familiar put ratio spread if you're not familiar I've< I've already created a number of videos I've already created a number of videos on< on my channel just go to my channel and on my channel just go to my channel and search< search for put ratio spread you see a search for put ratio spread you see a number< number of videos that show up so as you number of videos that show up so as you can< can see over here the put ratio spread can see over here the put ratio spread this< this is the structure you have two short this is the structure you have two short puts< puts and then you have one long put puts and then you have one long put now< now this is very important to actually now this is very important to actually trade< trade on the XSP rather than spy and the trade on the XSP rather than spy and the reason< reason is because the put ratio spread reason is because the put ratio spread is< is actually a very slow spread so what is actually a very slow spread so what it< it mean by a slow spread so as you can it mean by a slow spread so as you can see< see over here on the right hand side I see over here on the right hand side I have< have the p&amp;l graph of the put ratio have the p&amp;l graph of the put ratio spread< spread you can see the line in green spread you can see the line in green which< which is uh this one down here this is which is uh this one down here this is how< how your p&amp;l would look like at how your p&amp;l would look like at expiration< expiration but the purple line down here expiration but the purple line down here this< this reflects your p&amp;l for the current this reflects your p&amp;l for the current day< day so once you put it on you'll see day so once you put it on you'll see that< that even though right this is where the that even though right this is where the current< current market is even though the market current market is even though the market actually< actually goes into your tent as I would actually goes into your tent as I would like< like to call it you're actually still like to call it you're actually still not< not in a profit just yet because you not in a profit just yet because you need< need to take a look at the purple line need to take a look at the purple line purple< purple line just shows you the current purple line just shows you the current pnl< pnl for the day itself and over time pnl for the day itself and over time this< this purple line will start to gravitate this purple line will start to gravitate upwards< upwards to become this green line but upwards to become this green line but the< the problem with the put ratio spread is the problem with the put ratio spread is that< that it takes a very long time before it that it takes a very long time before it becomes< becomes this GRE line and most of the becomes this GRE line and most of the time< time based on what I've seen my time based on what I've seen my experience< experience is that it will get very experience is that it will get very close< close to the expiration day in fact the close to the expiration day in fact the last< last few days close to expiration then last few days close to expiration then you< you will see this purple line actually you will see this purple line actually goes< goes very close to the green line so goes very close to the green line so when< when you actually trade the put raare on when you actually trade the put raare on XSP< XSP you can hold it all the way to XSP you can hold it all the way to expiration< expiration because you don't have to expiration because you don't have to worry< worry about the assignment of shares so worry about the assignment of shares so let< let me show you what I mean over here so let me show you what I mean over here so if< if you take a look at the tip of this if you take a look at the tip of this tent< tent down here the Pinnacle of the tent tent down here the Pinnacle of the tent this< this is where you have your two short this is where you have your two short puts< puts at this denotes this two short puts at this denotes this two short putut< putut and then you have one long put putut and then you have one long put down< down here your long put is actually over down here your long put is actually over here< here right so this is where you have here right so this is where you have your< your one long put so for you to try and your one long put so for you to try and capitalize< capitalize on this put ratio spread to capitalize on this put ratio spread to try< try and capture you know the most try and capture you know the most profits< profits you actually want it to be profits you actually want it to be somewhere< somewhere inside the tent right somewhere inside the tent right preferably< preferably near where the two short puts preferably near where the two short puts are< are so imagine if the market actually are so imagine if the market actually traded< traded very close to where the short traded very close to where the short putut< putut is close to expiration so let's putut is close to expiration so let's say< say maybe it came down just below the say maybe it came down just below the two< two short puts if if you were to trade two short puts if if you were to trade this< this on spy then chances of you getting this on spy then chances of you getting the< the assignment of shares is going to be the assignment of shares is going to be very< very high then what's going to happen is very high then what's going to happen is that< that you're going to be long 200 shares that you're going to be long 200 shares and< and it's going to get very messy so if and it's going to get very messy so if you< you were to trade this on XSP instead you were to trade this on XSP instead you< you don't have to worry about this you don't have to worry about this because< because you can just hold all the way to because you can just hold all the way to exploration< exploration now if you're not able to exploration now if you're not able to put< put on the put ratio spread then do not put on the put ratio spread then do not worry< worry because you can put on the defined worry because you can put on the defined risk< risk version which is the put broken risk version which is the put broken wing< wing butterfly and the only difference wing butterfly and the only difference pretty< pretty much is the long put at the pretty much is the long put at the bottom< bottom of the structure so as you can bottom of the structure so as you can see< see this is your defensive long P where see this is your defensive long P where it< it capts the max loss on to stock number it capts the max loss on to stock number three< three and finally yes we have an actual three and finally yes we have an actual individual< individual stock and that is alphabet so individual stock and that is alphabet so the< the ticker symbol is Google g g l so why the ticker symbol is Google g g l so why Google< Google so one of the very first thing Google so one of the very first thing that< that I look out for in individual stocks that I look out for in individual stocks is< is to ensure that at least it is a is to ensure that at least it is a fundamentally< fundamentally strong stock so there are fundamentally strong stock so there are actually< actually quite a number of criteria to actually quite a number of criteria to identify< identify what's a fundamentally strong identify what's a fundamentally strong stock< stock but one of the things that I like stock but one of the things that I like to< to look at is to see the income to look at is to see the income statement< statement right basically the revenue statement right basically the revenue and< and the net income and what I'm looking and the net income and what I'm looking out< out for is that it has to have out for is that it has to have increasing< increasing revenue and net income as increasing revenue and net income as well< well over the past few years so in this well over the past few years so in this case< case over the past 5 years so as you can case over the past 5 years so as you can see< see pretty stable right pretty see pretty stable right pretty consistent< consistent so why is this important when consistent so why is this important when you're< you're trading individual stocks that is you're trading individual stocks that is because< because individual stocks can have a because individual stocks can have a risk< risk of it going bankrupt remember these risk of it going bankrupt remember these are< are all companies behind all this uh are all companies behind all this uh ticket< ticket down here so if the company is ticket down here so if the company is not< not doing well it's not profitable then not doing well it's not profitable then the< the chances of it going to bankruptcy is the chances of it going to bankruptcy is going< going to be there so the last thing you going to be there so the last thing you want< want is to trade a stock and think that want is to trade a stock and think that hey< hey it is very high premium High hey it is very high premium High volatility< volatility and the next day the company volatility and the next day the company announces< announces that it's going bankrupt then announces that it's going bankrupt then everything< everything is going to be gone right everything is going to be gone right unless< unless of course you're smart enough to unless of course you're smart enough to put< put on a bearish trade on on the underly put on a bearish trade on on the underly but< but for the most part if you want to but for the most part if you want to play< play it safe then look for a play it safe then look for a fundamentally< fundamentally strong stock at least you fundamentally strong stock at least you know< know that when you trade it it's still know that when you trade it it's still going< going to be around by the end of the going to be around by the end of the trade< trade now the next reason why Google trade now the next reason why Google because< because it's still currently below its because it's still currently below its fair< fair value so as you can see over here fair value so as you can see over here this< this is taken by simply Wall Street this is taken by simply Wall Street where< where it just shows you what is the where it just shows you what is the current< current price and the fair value and for current price and the fair value and for Google< Google right according to Simply Wall Google right according to Simply Wall Street< Street you can see that the fair value Street you can see that the fair value is< is much higher than where the current is much higher than where the current price< price is at least as of this recording price is at least as of this recording so< so why is this helpful now this is so why is this helpful now this is helpful< helpful because if you were to trade helpful because if you were to trade Google< Google and you know the fair value is Google and you know the fair value is above< above where the current price is then at above where the current price is then at least< least you have some sort of a margin of least you have some sort of a margin of safety< safety in a sense whereby if you were to safety in a sense whereby if you were to trade< trade any bullish strategies you kind of trade any bullish strategies you kind of have< have the confidence to know that over have the confidence to know that over the< the long term at least it can gravitate the long term at least it can gravitate towards< towards its fair value now of course towards its fair value now of course given< given that you know fair value has many given that you know fair value has many different< different ways to calculate it the best different ways to calculate it the best thing< thing you can do is just to go to all thing you can do is just to go to all the< the different sides try to get an the different sides try to get an aggregate< aggregate value of that and then just aggregate value of that and then just see< see where the fair value is if the fair see where the fair value is if the fair value< value is above where the current price value is above where the current price is< is then again at least you kind of put is then again at least you kind of put the< the odds on your site when you're the odds on your site when you're trading< trading the bullish strategy rather than trading the bullish strategy rather than if< if you find a stock where the fair value if you find a stock where the fair value is< is way below the current price then you is way below the current price then you know< know a little bit of caution there know a little bit of caution there especially< especially if you want to trade some especially if you want to trade some bullish< bullish strategies on that now the next bullish strategies on that now the next one< one is that Google has strong technicals one is that Google has strong technicals so< so what do I mean by strong technicals so what do I mean by strong technicals for< for me what I want to see is that the for me what I want to see is that the company< company or the underlying stock has been company or the underlying stock has been trading< trading for quite a long time right as trading for quite a long time right as you< you can see over here Google has been you can see over here Google has been trading< trading since what 2,000 2,000 plus so trading since what 2,000 2,000 plus so it's< it's quite a number of years and most it's quite a number of years and most importantly< importantly it has to have gone through importantly it has to have gone through several< several Market crashes and still made several Market crashes and still made new< new highs all right similar to spy as new highs all right similar to spy as you< you can see over here 2008 there was the you can see over here 2008 there was the great< great financial crisis Google actually great financial crisis Google actually went< went down it went down quite a bit but went down it went down quite a bit but eventually< eventually it recovered it went up again eventually it recovered it went up again same< same thing in pandemic 2020 in fact in same thing in pandemic 2020 in fact in 2020< 2020 you can't really see that much of a 2020 you can't really see that much of a decline< decline because uh Google actually did decline because uh Google actually did well< well during the pandemic a lot of the well during the pandemic a lot of the business< business shift their focus to online so business shift their focus to online so this< this is where Google actually did well this is where Google actually did well but< but in 2022 right as you can see over but in 2022 right as you can see over here< here that's the bare Market Google came here that's the bare Market Google came down< down a bit but then eventually made new down a bit but then eventually made new highs< highs again so again as you can see over highs again so again as you can see over here< here Google has the biasness towards the here Google has the biasness towards the upside< upside so if you know that it has a bias upside so if you know that it has a bias towards< towards the upside you know it's a towards the upside you know it's a fundamentally< fundamentally good stock and also it's fundamentally good stock and also it's below< below its fair value then you can kind below its fair value then you can kind of< of position your strategies to kind of of position your strategies to kind of take< take advantage of this so you're putting take advantage of this so you're putting all< all the odds in your favor rather than all the odds in your favor rather than blindly< blindly just looking for stocks with blindly just looking for stocks with huge< huge volatility okay so now what kind of huge volatility okay so now what kind of strategy< strategy should we be trading on Google strategy should we be trading on Google so< so for Google you can trade the wheel so for Google you can trade the wheel strategy< strategy so the wheel strategy a very strategy so the wheel strategy a very simple< simple strategy how it works is that you simple strategy how it works is that you first< first sell the cash secure put that first sell the cash secure put that means< means to say you actually want to get a means to say you actually want to get a sign< sign on the underlying so you wait for sign on the underlying so you wait for the< the stock to actually go below the cash the stock to actually go below the cash secure< secure put and let's say it expires in secure put and let's say it expires in the< the money you're going to get assigned the money you're going to get assigned the< the 100 shares then you sell your cover the 100 shares then you sell your cover call< call so this is the basic premise of the call so this is the basic premise of the real< real strategy pretty simple now I real strategy pretty simple now I personally< personally trade the income grid wheel personally trade the income grid wheel strategy< strategy so it's a variation of the strategy so it's a variation of the wheel< wheel strategy and basically it just wheel strategy and basically it just means< means is that instead of going for one means is that instead of going for one level< level and put all. your money there you level and put all your money there you split< split the risk for that one level into split the risk for that one level into multiple< multiple levels so if you want to find multiple levels so if you want to find out< out more on how I trade this then out more on how I trade this then definitely< definitely go and search for this inside definitely go and search for this inside my< my channel and you will see quite a my channel and you will see quite a number< number of videos going in depth to number of videos going in depth to explain< explain how to actually set this up next explain how to actually set this up next you< you have the short putut so for the you have the short putut so for the short< short putut which I am uh talking about short putut which I am uh talking about here< here is not the cash secure put but here is not the cash secure put but rather< rather the short putut on margin which rather the short putut on margin which sometime< sometime people you know coin it as the sometime people you know coin it as the naked< naked now it's not a very nice name but naked now it's not a very nice name but basically< basically it just means that you do not basically it just means that you do not want< want to get ass signed on the underline want to get ass signed on the underline now< now if you don't have enough Capital you now if you don't have enough Capital you don't< don't have big enough account size to don't have big enough account size to put< put on the short putut then you can put on the short putut then you can trade< trade the bull put spread so similar to trade the bull put spread so similar to what< what I mentioned in the Spy basically what I mentioned in the Spy basically the< the bull put spread capts your risk to the bull put spread capts your risk to the< the downside and can actually be very the downside and can actually be very helpful< helpful on individual stocks because helpful on individual stocks because individual< individual stocks as you know can have individual stocks as you know can have news< news that can really affect the movement news that can really affect the movement of< of the underline there can be very big of the underline there can be very big movements< movements for example if there's going movements for example if there's going to< to be earlys coming up well it could to be earlys coming up well it could have< have a very big gap up or down or maybe have a very big gap up or down or maybe there's< there's some unexpected news maybe the there's some unexpected news maybe the product< product launch didn't do well and that product launch didn't do well and that can< can create a very huge movement in the can create a very huge movement in the underline< underline so if you have this uh long underline so if you have this uh long put< put at the bottom down here then it's at put at the bottom down here then it's at least< least going to protect your max loss and least going to protect your max loss and next< next you can trade uh Google with the next you can trade uh Google with the call< call lips so I Shar this in one of my call lips so I Shar this in one of my videos< videos where I call it the six figure videos where I call it the six figure lip< lip strategies whereby you're buying a lip strategies whereby you're buying a deep< deep in the money long-dated call option deep in the money long-dated call option so< so this is meant to be a stock so this is meant to be a stock replacement< replacement strategy so if you are very replacement strategy so if you are very you< you know strong on Google you think that you know strong on Google you think that it's< it's going to appreciate in the long it's going to appreciate in the long term< term then you can consider you know term then you can consider you know trading< trading this call lips and finally you trading this call lips and finally you can< can trade the diagonal spread or the can trade the diagonal spread or the poorman's< poorman's cover call basically what it poorman's cover call basically what it is< is is just a long call and then you sell is is just a long call and then you sell the< the cover call above down here now on to the cover call above down here now on to our< our fourth stock so our fourth stock is our fourth stock so our fourth stock is another< another tech stock and that is Amazon so another tech stock and that is Amazon so why< why Amazon well pretty much the same why Amazon well pretty much the same reasons< reasons which I listed for Google and reasons which I listed for Google and you< you will notice this is actually the you will notice this is actually the theme< theme that I have when I pick individual theme that I have when I pick individual stocks< stocks so they have to be fundamentally stocks so they have to be fundamentally strong< strong so as you can see over here strong so as you can see over here Amazon< Amazon uh increasing Revenue over the Amazon uh increasing Revenue over the past< past few years increasing net income as past few years increasing net income as well< well except for maybe 2022 but over the well except for maybe 2022 but over the long< long term it has been doing pretty well long term it has been doing pretty well next< next it is also below its fair value and next it is also below its fair value and as< as you can see over here the fair value as you can see over here the fair value is< is much greater than where the current is much greater than where the current price< price is at least as of this recording price is at least as of this recording and< and finally strong technicals in fact and finally strong technicals in fact Amazon< Amazon has even gone through one of the Amazon has even gone through one of the most< most challenging ing times for a tech most challenging ing times for a tech stock< stock which is in the year 2000 so this stock which is in the year 2000 so this is< is where the dot bubble actually is where the dot bubble actually happened< happened and a lot of tech stocks all happened and a lot of tech stocks all this< this internet stocks back then a lot of this internet stocks back then a lot of them< them actually went bankrupt out of them actually went bankrupt out of business< business but Amazon not only did it business but Amazon not only did it survive< survive but actually went up to make new survive but actually went up to make new highs< highs over time so one option strategies highs over time so one option strategies to< to trade on Amazon so same thing similar to trade on Amazon so same thing similar to< to Google you can trade the real to Google you can trade the real strategy< strategy so wait until the market comes strategy so wait until the market comes down< down let you get a sign on the 100 down let you get a sign on the 100 shares< shares and then you sell the cover call shares and then you sell the cover call now< now if you have a little bit more now if you have a little bit more Capital< Capital then you can trade the income Capital then you can trade the income grid< grid wheel strategy in fact I have grid wheel strategy in fact I have documented< documented my usage of the income grid documented my usage of the income grid wheel< wheel strategy on Amazon on my channel wheel strategy on Amazon on my channel so< so you can head on over to my channel so you can head on over to my channel just< just type for the income grip bu just type for the income grip bu strategy< strategy again you will see a number of strategy again you will see a number of videos< videos one of them I share my case study videos one of them I share my case study where< where actually show you how I plot this where actually show you how I plot this out< out or plan out the levels for the out or plan out the levels for the income< income grid wheel strategy on Amazon income grid wheel strategy on Amazon next< next you have the short put similar to next you have the short put similar to the< the Google as well and if you don't have the Google as well and if you don't have the< the capital for that a small account the capital for that a small account size< size you can trade the bull put spread size you can trade the bull put spread and< and same thing if you believe in Amazon and same thing if you believe in Amazon you< you can trade cyse as a stock you can trade cyse as a stock replacement< replacement and you can also trade the replacement and you can also trade the diagonal< diagonal spread or the poor men's cover diagonal spread or the poor men's cover call< call now we have finally come to the call now we have finally come to the fifth< fifth and final stock and that is United fifth and final stock and that is United Health< Health Group the ticker symbol is UNH so Health Group the ticker symbol is UNH so this< this is slightly different from the tech this is slightly different from the tech stocks< stocks which I've just shown you in stocks which I've just shown you in number< number three and number four this is number three and number four this is actually< actually a healthc care stock so for UNH actually a healthc care stock so for UNH I< I actually don't trade it as often as I actually don't trade it as often as some< some of the underlying that I've shown some of the underlying that I've shown on< on on this video so far but when I've on on this video so far but when I've traded< traded it I've actually done pretty well traded it I've actually done pretty well on< on it so why un H so first off same on it so why un H so first off same thing< thing as well fundamentally strong stock thing as well fundamentally strong stock as< as you can see over here increasing as you can see over here increasing Revenue< Revenue increasing net income as well Revenue increasing net income as well next< next it's also currently below its fair next it's also currently below its fair value< value as you can see over here the fair value as you can see over here the fair value< value given by simply Wall Street is value given by simply Wall Street is $1,316< $1,316 and as you can see based on the $1,316 and as you can see based on the current< current price at least as of this current price at least as of this recording< recording it's significantly undervalue recording it's significantly undervalue now< now of course if you find this fair now of course if you find this fair value< value a little bit way too high a little value a little bit way too high a little bit< bit too ridiculous again you can bit too ridiculous again you can discount< discount the value right so maybe if you discount the value right so maybe if you want< want to take a more conservative value want to take a more conservative value maybe< maybe put it at $11,000 or $750 or maybe put it at $11,000 or $750 or something< something like that and you see that the something like that and you see that the current< current price is still below that then current price is still below that then at< at least you know that you still have at least you know that you still have put< put you know more odds in your favor put you know more odds in your favor next< next UNH strong technicals as well as next UNH strong technicals as well as you< you can see UNH have traded for many you can see UNH have traded for many years< years as well all the way dated back to years as well all the way dated back to around< around 1990s and over all the different around 1990s and over all the different Market< Market Market crashes the market still Market Market crashes the market still eventually< eventually still make new highs so all eventually still make new highs so all these< these are the same as Amazon and Google these are the same as Amazon and Google but< but there is one added reason why we but there is one added reason why we want< want to trade UNH and is that UNH can want to trade UNH and is that UNH can actually< actually be considered a Recession Proof actually be considered a Recession Proof stock< stock at least that's is what you know stock at least that's is what you know the< the consensus says it is because the consensus says it is because generally< generally when the market is in generally when the market is in recession< recession or the world is in recession recession or the world is in recession you< you still need to go and see the doctor you still need to go and see the doctor right< right if you're sick you still need to right if you're sick you still need to go< go and see the doctor and at the same go and see the doctor and at the same time< time it's not so highly correlated to time it's not so highly correlated to the< the market so for example so you can see the market so for example so you can see over< over here this chart down here I've over here this chart down here I've shown< shown is of 2022 so as you know in 2022 shown is of 2022 so as you know in 2022 it< it was a bare Market most of the stocks it was a bare Market most of the stocks actually< actually went down some of them really actually went down some of them really went< went very far down but if you take a went very far down but if you take a look< look at UNH over here it actually look at UNH over here it actually progressively< progressively went up and down and progressively went up and down and actually< actually pretty much went a little bit actually pretty much went a little bit higher< higher than where it started off so in a higher than where it started off so in a sense< sense it kind of provides a little bit sense it kind of provides a little bit of< of diversification so if you were to of diversification so if you were to let's< let's say trade spy trade Google and let's say trade spy trade Google and then< then you trade UNH and let's say you put then you trade UNH and let's say you put bullish< bullish positions on all them then at bullish positions on all them then at least< least you know that if the market least you know that if the market actually< actually goes down then your UNH is at actually goes down then your UNH is at least< least not going to be in the same boat least not going to be in the same boat as< as the other two right because you have as the other two right because you have some< some slight diversification not too some slight diversification not too correlated< correlated to the market okay so what correlated to the market okay so what option< option strategy should you trade on uhan option strategy should you trade on uhan H< H so UNH slightly different from the H so UNH slightly different from the other< other underlines which I've shared so other underlines which I've shared so far< far in this video and also because UNH far in this video and also because UNH is< is pretty pricey so as of this recording is pretty pricey so as of this recording is< is over $500 and if you were to take a is over $500 and if you were to take a look< look at the option strike price look at the option strike price you'll< you'll notice that there is only $10 you'll notice that there is only $10 strike< strike intervals so if there's $10 strike intervals so if there's $10 strike< strike intervals it can be you know strike intervals it can be you know pretty< pretty costly if you were to trade some pretty costly if you were to trade some of< of those credit strategies so instead of of those credit strategies so instead of putting< putting on the credit strategies for putting on the credit strategies for this< this UNH I actually trade debit this UNH I actually trade debit strategies< strategies and also another reason is strategies and also another reason is because< because the volatility is not that high because the volatility is not that high so< so when the volatility is not that high so when the volatility is not that high on< on the underlying you can actually on the underlying you can actually choose< choose to put on debit strategies so choose to put on debit strategies so what< what debit strategies well the first one what debit strategies well the first one is< is the buo call spread so the call is the buo call spread so the call spread< spread very simple buy a call option and spread very simple buy a call option and then< then sell a further out call option so then sell a further out call option so this< this is the bull call spread and if you this is the bull call spread and if you were< were to construct one based on the $10 were to construct one based on the $10 strike< strike interval then you can have strike interval then you can have roughly< roughly about $500 risk for that trade roughly about $500 risk for that trade so< so it's also doable even though you so it's also doable even though you don't< don't have that big of a account now the don't have that big of a account now the next< next and final strategy you can trade on next and final strategy you can trade on UNH< UNH is the diagonal spread or can be UNH is the diagonal spread or can be also< also considered the Poorman cover call also considered the Poorman cover call if< if you traded the longer term DTE so if you traded the longer term DTE so this< this is actually what I traded on un H this is actually what I traded on un H and< and in fact I have actually documented and in fact I have actually documented this< this in one of my videos so again if this in one of my videos so again if you're< you're interested just go to my channel you're interested just go to my channel and< and look for poorman's cover call and and look for poorman's cover call and you< you should be able to see my example you should be able to see my example where< where I traded you and H on this okay so where I traded you and H on this okay so these< these are the five stocks that have these are the five stocks that have cumulatively< cumulatively generated me pretty decent cumulatively generated me pretty decent profits< profits and I would say it's suitable profits and I would say it's suitable for< for you as well especially if you are for you as well especially if you are new< new to trading option so hopefully this new to trading option so hopefully this video< video has been helpful for you and if it video has been helpful for you and if it has< has I would greatly appreciate it if you has I would greatly appreciate it if you give< give me a thumbs up on the video and

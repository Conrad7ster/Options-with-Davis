### The ALMIGHTY Put Ratio Spread Strategy-yi97UwGVoYA
======================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so today's video all right alrighty so today's video we're< we're gonna be talking about the we're gonna be talking about the almighty< almighty put ratio spread strategy and almighty put ratio spread strategy and this< this is one of my favorite option this is one of my favorite option strategy< strategy to use whenever i want to get strategy to use whenever i want to get into< into a long stock position and that's into a long stock position and that's because< because by using the put ratio spread because by using the put ratio spread strategy< strategy if the market goes up i make strategy if the market goes up i make money< money the market comes down i make even money the market comes down i make even more< more money and i get into a long stock more money and i get into a long stock position< position as well so this is something position as well so this is something that< that you can't do if you were to just that you can't do if you were to just use< use the traditional way of uh placing a use the traditional way of uh placing a buy< buy limit order right so in this video buy limit order right so in this video i'm< i'm going to share with you everything i'm going to share with you everything you< you need to know about the put ratio you need to know about the put ratio spread< spread and also why you want to use it spread and also why you want to use it how< how to construct it i'm also going to how to construct it i'm also going to share< share with you a trade that i just share with you a trade that i just placed< placed on i'm going to share with you my placed on i'm going to share with you my game< game plan so you know exactly what you game plan so you know exactly what you can< can do for yourself as well based on the can do for yourself as well based on the different< different scenarios that happens after different scenarios that happens after you< you place the put ratio spread all right you place the put ratio spread all right so< so first off what is a put ratio spread so first off what is a put ratio spread right< right so the put ratio spread is a right so the put ratio spread is a combination< combination of the long put spread and combination of the long put spread and the< the short put option right so the long the short put option right so the long put< put spread is also what you would put spread is also what you would commonly< commonly be known as the bear put spread commonly be known as the bear put spread right< right basically it is a bearish strategy right basically it is a bearish strategy right< right so for example if the market is uh right so for example if the market is uh this< this way this way so< so the long put spreads basically what so the long put spreads basically what you< you do is you buy a put option you do is you buy a put option you< you buy one put option uh somewhere at you buy one put option uh somewhere at the< the money or you can buy one slightly in the money or you can buy one slightly in the< the money or for the out of the money the money or for the out of the money but< but generally the place where i like to but generally the place where i like to do< do it is to buy somewhere around at the do it is to buy somewhere around at the money< money and then sell a further out of the money and then sell a further out of the money< money put option so this way you have a money put option so this way you have a put< put spread down here you are long a put put spread down here you are long a put option< option and you're short a further out of option and you're short a further out of the< the money production so this way if the the money production so this way if the market< market was to go down you'll be able to market was to go down you'll be able to make< make the profit on the difference make the profit on the difference between< between the strike price at expiration between the strike price at expiration right< right so this is the essentially the right so this is the essentially the put< put spread so the short put basically is put spread so the short put basically is used< used to finance the cost of the used to finance the cost of the loan< loan put spread because the loan put loan put spread because the loan put spread< spread is a debit spread right you have spread is a debit spread right you have to< to pay for it but when you have a short to pay for it but when you have a short put put put right< right let's say you sell a further out right let's say you sell a further out of< of the money short put so this credit of the money short put so this credit down< down here is used to finance the debit down here is used to finance the debit that< that you pay for for your long put that you pay for for your long put spread< spread so in the end this can become a spread so in the end this can become a credit< credit right a total is a credit so what credit right a total is a credit so what we< we ideally want is to have the short put we ideally want is to have the short put credit< credit to be more than the bare put credit to be more than the bare put spread< spread debit now the reason why this is spread debit now the reason why this is called< called a ratio spread is simply because called a ratio spread is simply because there< there is a ratio between the long put there is a ratio between the long put option< option and the short put option so option and the short put option so there's< there's always more short put options there's always more short put options then< then there is the long put option now then there is the long put option now some< some people like to do a different ratio some people like to do a different ratio like< like for example in this case this is like for example in this case this is what< what you call a one is to two what you call a one is to two uh< uh put ratio spread where you have your uh put ratio spread where you have your long< long one put option your short two put long one put option your short two put option< option right some people like to maybe option right some people like to maybe go< go for one is to three so in this case go for one is to three so in this case there'll< there'll be three short put options and there'll be three short put options and then< then you have one long put option now then you have one long put option now you< you can go to one is to four one is to you can go to one is to four one is to five< five it's very versatile but the thing five it's very versatile but the thing you< you need to take note of is that the you need to take note of is that the more< more put option the more short put more put option the more short put option< option that you have on the more risk option that you have on the more risk you're< you're going to take but this also of you're going to take but this also of course< course helps in increasing your course helps in increasing your profitability< profitability but the trade-off is that profitability but the trade-off is that it< it takes on more risk as well and of it takes on more risk as well and of course< course you can also course you can also sell< sell the put option at the same strike sell the put option at the same strike right< right normally what a lot of people do right normally what a lot of people do is< is all right let me just remove this is all right let me just remove this what< what people would do is that they will what people would do is that they will sell< sell two put option sell two put option at< at the same strike and then one long put at the same strike and then one long put option option option near< near somewhere at the money so in this near somewhere at the money so in this case< case uh you have a put ratio spread case uh you have a put ratio spread where< where the short put uh where the short put uh are< are at the same strike so you can see are at the same strike so you can see there's< there's an embedded long put spread down there's an embedded long put spread down here< here and then you have a short put here and then you have a short put option< option as well right so i'm going to get option as well right so i'm going to get into< into a little bit more about the into a little bit more about the construction< construction of a put ratio spread the construction of a put ratio spread the different< different ways that you can construct it different ways that you can construct it it's< it's very flexible but for now you just it's very flexible but for now you just want< want to know that this is why it's want to know that this is why it's called< called a put ratio spread because of the called a put ratio spread because of the ratio< ratio all right so the whole idea of the ratio all right so the whole idea of the put< put ratio spread is you want to route put ratio spread is you want to route this< this whole order for a credit right a this whole order for a credit right a put< put ratio spread in general is a credit put ratio spread in general is a credit spread< spread because you have the additional spread because you have the additional short< short put right the additional short put short put right the additional short put is< is meant to finance whatever cost that is meant to finance whatever cost that you're< you're paying for the long put spread so you're paying for the long put spread so in< in this case you can see in this example in this case you can see in this example the< the long put spread is two dollars and the long put spread is two dollars and 18< 18 cents right so you have to pay this 18 cents right so you have to pay this to< to buy this long put spread to buy this long put spread but< but then we're going to be selling the but then we're going to be selling the put< put option and we're going to receive put option and we're going to receive two< two dollars and 44 cents so in this case two dollars and 44 cents so in this case you're< you're gonna have a overall credit of 26 you're gonna have a overall credit of 26 cents< cents right so that means you're cents right so that means you're receiving< receiving 26 receiving 26 per< per option contract per put ratio spread per option contract per put ratio spread right< right based on one is to two you're right based on one is to two you're going< going to have 26 dollars going to have 26 dollars into< into your account right so for this put into your account right so for this put ratio< ratio spread ratio spread you< you can see that it's all routed for a you can see that it's all routed for a single< single order ticket right you do not single order ticket right you do not enter< enter it as a separate order you enter enter it as a. separate order you enter it< it all as one order ticket and this is it all as one order ticket and this is essentially< essentially the put ratio spread so why essentially the put ratio spread so why do< do you want to use the put ratio spread do you want to use the put ratio spread well< well first of all the pure ratio spread well first of all the pure ratio spread is< is a multi-directional strategy that is a multi-directional strategy that profits< profits in all directions right so profits in all directions right so because< because you're correcting a credit at because you're correcting a credit at the< the start when you're selling this put the start when you're selling this put ratio< ratio spread if the market is to go up ratio spread if the market is to go up right< right let's say for example right let's say for example let< let me just use this let me just use this example< example down here example down here let's< let's say for example the market is down let's say for example the market is down here< here and you have your put ratio spread here and you have your put ratio spread somewhere< somewhere here right so you have two somewhere here right so you have two short< short put here and you have one long put short put here and you have one long put option< option down here okay so at this point option down here okay so at this point of< of time right when you sell this put of time right when you sell this put ratio< ratio spread you're going to receive a ratio spread you're going to receive a credit< credit right you're going to be credit right you're going to be receiving< receiving your credit so if the market receiving your credit so if the market is< is to go up is to go up if< if the market is to go up right it if the market is to go up right it doesn't< doesn't get into your put ratio spread doesn't get into your put ratio spread at< at all the whole spread expires at all the whole spread expires worthless< worthless and expiration and then you worthless and expiration and then you just< just keep the credit that you receive at just keep the credit that you receive at the< the start right but if the market was to the start right but if the market was to go< go down go down right< right then you would be profiting on right then you would be profiting on this< this long put spread that's embedded in this long put spread that's embedded in this< this put ratio you will make the this put ratio you will make the difference< difference between this two strike and difference between this two strike and then< then at the same time you will be then at the same time you will be exercised< exercised on your short options so this exercised on your short options so this way< way you'll be long 100 stocks so 100 way you'll be long 100 stocks so 100 shares< shares i mean so that is why i say this shares i mean so that is why i say this is< is a very good way for you to get into a is a very good way for you to get into a long< long stock position because you get paid long stock position because you get paid on< on this a long put spread down here so on this a long put spread down here so this< this is a great way to get into long this is a great way to get into long stock< stock position and you get paid to get stock position and you get paid to get into< into a long stock position right you get into a long stock position right you get paid< paid the portion is because of this paid the portion is because of this debit< debit spread right so in order for you debit spread right so in order for you to< to actually get a sign on your short put to actually get a sign on your short put you< you need to first make money on the long you need to first make money on the long put< put spread right that means you're sort put spread right that means you're sort of< of like incentivizing yourself the of like incentivizing yourself the market< market has to go down past you help you market has to go down past you help you make< make money on your long put spread make money on your long put spread before< before you can get assigned on your before you can get assigned on your short< short put all right so psychologically short put all right so psychologically this< this is a very this is a very good< good way to enter into a trade because good way to enter into a trade because if< if you were to just sell a normal cash if you were to just sell a normal cash token< token output or a short put to get into token output or a short put to get into the< the long stock position right so let's the long stock position right so let's say< say for example you do not have the put say for example you do not have the put ratio< ratio spread ratio spread let's< let's say you just have one short put let's say you just have one short put down< down here right so when you sell it at down here right so when you sell it at this< this point of time without this embedded this point of time without this embedded long< long put spread long put spread as< as the market goes down you're going to as the market goes down you're going to be< be losing money on this shop which also be losing money on this shop which also means< means that you could have actually sold means that you could have actually sold this< this short put for much more had you this short put for much more had you waited< waited until the market went down waited until the market went down further< further so psychologically it's not further so psychologically it's not going< going to be as easy to take in because going to be as easy to take in because you're< you're going to be seeing a loss on your you're going to be seeing a loss on your short< short put as the market goes down but short put as the market goes down but with< with the with the put< put ratio spread as the market goes down put ratio spread as the market goes down you< you know you're going to be making more you know you're going to be making more money< money because of the embedded long put money because of the embedded long put spread< spread right spread right so< so that is why you get paid right you so that is why you get paid right you get< get paid much more than a simple short get paid much more than a simple short put< put a cash output put a cash output when< when you are entering into this strategy when you are entering into this strategy all< all right so the other thing is that it all right so the other thing is that it is< is very flexible right you can adjust is very flexible right you can adjust your< your strike to be more bullish or more your strike to be more bullish or more bearish< bearish okay so i'm going to be sharing bearish okay so i'm going to be sharing with< with you a little bit more how you with you a little bit more how you construct< construct it but basically when you're construct it but basically when you're having< having a put ratio spread you can having a put ratio spread you can construct< construct it so that you collect more construct it so that you collect more credit< credit on the front end so that if the credit on the front end so that if the market< market goes up you receive much more market goes up you receive much more money< money right the whole spread expires money right the whole spread expires both< both love as you just basically collect both love as you just basically collect the< the credit that you receive when you the credit that you receive when you sell< sell the put ratio spread or you can sell the put ratio spread or you can make< make it more bearish in the sense make it more bearish in the sense whereby< whereby you increase the size of your whereby you increase the size of your embedded< embedded long put spread so that the embedded long put spread so that the credit< credit that you receive upfront for credit that you receive upfront for selling< selling the put ratio spread is very selling the put ratio spread is very minimal< minimal so this way you're more minimal so this way you're more incentivized< incentivized for the market to go down incentivized for the market to go down right< right you want the market to go down to right you want the market to go down to make< make more because you have a embedded make more because you have a embedded long< long put spread that is wider they will long put spread that is wider they will make< make more money if the market goes down make more money if the market goes down so< so again i'm going to share with you so again i'm going to share with you this< this in the next slide so this can be this in the next slide so this can be seen< seen as a mini hatch against a bullish seen as a mini hatch against a bullish portfolio< portfolio especially right now if you do portfolio especially right now if you do have< have some long stocks going on then you have some long stocks going on then you want< want to have a more bearish pool ratio want to have a more bearish pool ratio spread< spread so this way you can incentivize spread so this way you can incentivize in< in a sense where but if the market goes in a sense where but if the market goes down< down while the rest of your long stock down while the rest of your long stock position< position is you know in a drawdown position is you know in a drawdown you'll< you'll be actually making more money on you'll be actually making more money on your< your put ratio spread because the market your put ratio spread because the market needs< needs to go down in order for the needs to go down in order for the embedded< embedded long put spread to make money embedded long put spread to make money so< so that is why you make more money when so that is why you make more money when the< the market goes down all right so i'm the market goes down all right so i'm going< going to share with you how you can going to share with you how you can construct< construct your put ratio spread so first construct your put ratio spread so first of< of all for the put ratio spread we're of all for the put ratio spread we're going< going to be looking at a days to going to be looking at a days to expiration< expiration somewhere 30 to 60 days right expiration somewhere 30 to 60 days right the< the longer your days to expiration the the longer your days to expiration the bigger< bigger or rather the wider the width of bigger or rather the wider the width of the< the long put spread you can construct the long put spread you can construct right< right so that is because right so that is because your your your short< short put would be worth more you get short put would be worth more you get more< more premium on the longer days to more premium on the longer days to expiration< expiration because of that you can buy a expiration because of that you can buy a more< more expensive or rather a wider long more expensive or rather a wider long put< put spread all right so put spread all right so for< for the short put you want the strike to for the short put you want the strike to be< be at 0. 5 to 0.

2 deltas and or at or be at 0. 5 to 0.

2 deltas and or at or below< below a support level right ideally below a support level right ideally whenever< whenever you enter into a pull ratio whenever you enter into a pull ratio spread< spread you want to have in mind where is spread you want to have in mind where is it< it that you want to long the 100 shares it that you want to long the 100 shares right< right remember we always enter a put right remember we always enter a put ratio< ratio spread as a way to get into a long ratio spread as a way to get into a long stock< stock position so in this case let's say stock position so in this case let's say if< if you take a. look at this table here if you take a look at this table here let's< let's say you have decided that let's say you have decided that 105< 105 is going to be the place that you 105 is going to be the place that you want< want to long to get long 100 shares is want to long to get long 100 shares is because< because there is a support level around because there is a support level around here< here then you don't you know you you here then you don't you know you you can't< can't ignore this delta position right can't ignore this delta position right because< because you already decided you want to because you already decided you want to get< get long at 105. so in this case you get long at 105.

so in this case you don't< don't really need to care about the don't really need to care about the delta< delta right but let's say for example delta right but let's say for example the< the support level is somewhere much the support level is somewhere much further< further down let's say around the 90 further down let's say around the 90 mark< mark right in this case then you can use mark right in this case then you can use the< the 15 to 20 deltas as a benchmark of the 15 to 20 deltas as a benchmark of where< where you should be selling your cash to where you should be selling your cash to the< the output now of course you can wait the output now of course you can wait for< for the market to go lower so that you for the market to go lower so that you can< can sell the the cash output or rather can sell the the cash output or rather the< the short put at the 90 strike price the short put at the 90 strike price right< right that's one option or in this case right that's one option or in this case if< if you want to just go ahead and sell if you want to just go ahead and sell the< the put ratio spread right now and you the put ratio spread right now and you actually< actually don't mind let me just remove actually don't mind let me just remove this< this down here let's say you do not mind this down here let's say you do not mind at< at all getting long at this 100 strike at all getting long at this 100 strike price< price then this is the one you want to price then this is the one you want to use< use because it's roughly 15 to 20 deltas use because it's roughly 15 to 20 deltas then< then after that you can construct the then after that you can construct the long< long put spread all. right so i'm going long put spread all right so i'm going to< to share with you my own trade example to share with you my own trade example where< where i use a support level to get into where i use a support level to get into the< the short put side of the put ratio the short put side of the put ratio spread< spread all right but that's for the next spread all right but that's for the next slide< slide so for now let's talk about how slide so for now let's talk about how you're< you're going to construct the long put you're going to construct the long put spread< spread so the long post spread really spread so the long post spread really depends< depends on your view right so there are depends on your view right so there are many< many ways to construct this that's why many ways to construct this that's why it's< it's very flexible so let's say you are it's very flexible so let's say you are more< more bullish right if you are more more bullish right if you are more bullish< bullish on the put ratio or rather on bullish on the put ratio or rather on the< the underlying stock then you can have a the underlying stock then you can have a smaller< smaller width for your long put spread smaller width for your long put spread which< which results in a smaller debit so which results in a smaller debit so let's< let's work this out together all right let's work this out together all right so< so let's say for example we've decided so let's say for example we've decided that< that our short put is going to be the that our short put is going to be the 100< 100 strike price right so for 100 strike 100 strike price right so for 100 strike price< price let's take a look at the mark so price let's take a look at the mark so the< the mark is around 1. 645 so let's run it the mark is around 1.

645 so let's run it off< off we're going to receive. a credit of off we're going to receive a credit of 1. 645< 1.

645 all right so for the 100 strike 1. 645 all right so for the 100 strike price< price let's say we're going to be price. let's say we're going to be receiving receiving receiving a< a credit of a credit of 1.

65< 1. 65 cents okay so when we are 1.

65 cents okay so when we are constructing< constructing this long put spread we constructing this long put spread we want< want to have a debit of anything that's want to have a debit of anything that's lesser< lesser than lesser than and< and 65 cents so let's see what we can and 65 cents so let's see what we can construct<. construct down here so let's go for a construct down here so let's go for a smaller< smaller width so a smaller width would smaller width so a smaller width would simply< simply be let's say we want to simply be let's say we want to sell< sell another 100 stripe sell another 100 stripe all< all right the put spread of 102. 5 to 100 all right the put spread of 102.

5 to 100 so< so in this case we'll be. buying the so in this case we'll be buying the 102. 5< 102.

#### Topic 1

5 strike price and selling another 102. 5 strike price and selling another 100< 100 right strike price so in this case 100 right strike price so in this case what< what is the debit for this spread so what is the debit for this spread so let's< let's do a quick calculation here let's let's do a quick calculation here let's just< just. bring out our trusty calculator so just bring out our trusty calculator so what< what we're going to do is we are going what we're going to do is we are going to to to buy< buy at two dollars eight cents so it buy at two dollars eight cents so it will< will be minus 2.

08 will be minus 2. 08 and< and then we are going to and then. we are going to receive< receive a credit of 1.

65 receive a credit of 1. 65 1.

65< 1. 65 so what this means this is a total 1.

65 so what this means this is a total debit< debit of debit of 0. 43< 0.

43 so down here we are going to be 0. 43 so down here we are going to be creating< creating the creating the 102.

5 102. 5 102.

5 long< long put spread long put spread all< all right with the 100 all right with the 100. and< and this is going to cost us roughly and this is going to cost us roughly negative< negative 0. 43 negative 0.

43 [Music] [Music] [Music] so< so if we take 1. 65 minus 1.

#### Topic 2

43 what is so if we take 1. 65 minus 1.

43 what is the< the net credit that we received and that the net credit that we received and that credit< credit we're going to receive is going credit we're going to receive is going to< to be one dollar to be one dollar and< and 22 cents and 22 cents right<. right so as you can see down here we right so as you can see down here we have< have it constructed a pretty small have it constructed a pretty small a< a long put spread the embedded put a long put spread the embedded put spread< spread inside here is only 2. 5 spread inside here is only 2.

5 points< points wide so that means if the market points wide so that means if the market was< was to go below this 100 point. then was to go below this 100 point then we're< we're going to make the full profit of we're going to make the full profit of 2. 50< 2.

50 which is 250 2. 50 which is 250 on< on the put spread all right on the put spread all right plus< plus uh we're gonna have this credit on plus uh we're gonna have this credit on the< the put ratio spread which is a dollar the put ratio. spread which is a dollar 22< 22 cents so we have created a dollar 22 22 cents so we have created a dollar 22 cents< cents that means if the market was to go cents that means if the market was to go above< above 102.

5 that means the market or above 102. 5 that means the market or rather< rather the underlying. stock expires rather the underlying stock expires above< above 102.

5 at expiration above 102. 5 at expiration then< then we're going to receive this full then we're going to receive this full credit< credit of a dollar and 22 cents which is credit of a dollar and 22 cents which is not< not too bad right because if we. were to not too bad right because if we were to just< just sell the cash output or the short just sell the cash output or the short put< put by itself we're going to be put by itself we're going to be receiving< receiving 1.

65 and by buying this receiving 1. 65 and by buying this embedded< embedded long put spread we're going to embedded long put spread we're going to be< be paying. uh 43 cents so that means the be paying uh 43 cents so that means the overall< overall credit is going to be 1.

22 which overall credit is going to be 1. 22 which is< is not too far off from just selling the is not too far off from just selling the short< short. put now the reason why you want to short put now the reason why you want to buy< buy this right just the 102.

5 100 buy this right just the 102. 5 100 for< for this put ratio spread is that in the for this put ratio spread is that in the event< event if the market was to go below 100 event if the market was to go below 100 points< points right below 100 at expiration points right below 100 at expiration what< what this means is that our profit will what this means is that our profit will now< now be an additional now be an additional two< two dollars and 50 cents because of the two dollars and 50 cents because of the difference difference difference between< between this two strike price right the between this two strike price right the difference< difference between these two price will difference between these two price will be< be our profit if the market closes below be our profit if the market closes below the< the 100 strike price so this gives us a the 100 strike price so this gives us a total< total of three dollars and 72 cents if total of three dollars. and 72 cents if the< the market was to close below a hundred the market was to close below a hundred dollars< dollars uh at expiration so that means dollars uh at expiration so that means if< if you're more bullish you want to if you're more bullish you want to collect< collect more credit up front now what if collect more credit up front now what if you< you are more bearish if you're more you are more bearish if you're more bearish< bearish then you want to create a larger bearish then you want to create a larger width< width with a bigger debit on your long width with a bigger debit on your long put< put spread let me just remove all this put spread let me just remove all this all< all right so same thing down here we all right so same thing down here we have< have the 100 strike price for our shot have the 100 strike price for our shot put< put so we're going to receive 1.

#### Topic 3

65 now put so we're going to receive 1. 65 now let's< let's see how big of a put spread let's see how big of a put spread that< that we can. create right that is uh that that we can create right that is uh that costs costs costs slightly< slightly lesser than 1.

65 cents or slightly lesser than 1. 65 cents or roughly< roughly equal because at the end of the roughly equal because at the end of the day< day we want to route this for small day we want to route this for small credit< credit or even break even we definitely credit or even break even we definitely do< do not want to pay a debit for this all do not want to pay a debit for this all right< right so let's take a look at which is right so let's take a look at which is the< the strikes that we can create for this the strikes that we can create for this so< so let's say we take the 100 strike. so let's say we take the 100 strike price< price right as the short price right as the short end< end of the the short leg of our put end of the the short leg of our put spread spread spread and< and then we can see what else we can buy and then we can see what else we can buy against< against it right what spread we can buy against it right what spread we can buy against< against it so let's take our calculator against it so let's take our calculator down< down here and let us calculate to see down here and let us calculate to see which< which one we can get 1.

65 cents or which one we can get 1. 65 cents or lesser< lesser right so let's say let's. take the lesser right so let's say let's take the 107.

5< 107. 5 107.

5 we're going to be paying 107. 5 107.

5 we're going to be paying roughly< roughly negative 3. 28 roughly negative 3.

28 and< and then we're going to add and then we're going to add 1. 65< 1.

65 down here 1. 65 down here so< so it gives us 1.

63 which is just so it gives us 1. 63 which is just perfect< perfect right perfect right. so< so the 1 0 so the 1 0 7.

#### Topic 4

5 and< and we have and we have the< the 100 strike the 100 strike. and< and that gives us a negative of and that gives us a negative of 1. 63< 1.

63 cents which means the whole 1. 63 cents which means the whole put< put ratio spread right now will give us put ratio spread right now will give us a< a credit of just nice. two cents that a credit of just nice two cents that means< means if the market was to close above means if the market was to close above 107.

5< 107. 5 right now we are using this right 107.

5 right now we are using this right if< if the market closes above one zero if the market closes above one zero seven< seven point five then we're just going seven point five then we're just going to< to get just two dollars you know you to get just two dollars you know you just< just get two dollars we don't get uh just get two dollars we don't get uh that< that much and we don't get any money but that much and we don't get any money but at< at least we do not lose money but here's at least we do not lose money but here's the< the thing because you are more bearish the thing because you are more bearish right< right in this case maybe you have a long right in this. case maybe you have a long stock< stock portfolio already you have quite a stock portfolio already you have quite a lot< lot of long stock positions so in this lot of long stock positions so in this case< case you are pretty much trying to hedge case you are pretty much trying to hedge your< your position in case the market goes your position in case the market goes down< down because as the market moves down down because as the market moves down most< most of the stock will go down as well most of the stock will go down as well so< so when the market goes down past 100 so when the market goes down past 100 strike< strike price you will be making a strike price you will be making a whopping< whopping 7. 5 points whopping 7.

5 points on< on this long put spread right so 7. 5 on this long put spread right so 7.

5 points< points is basically 750 right seven points is basically 750 right seven dollars< dollars and fifty cents right so as you dollars and fifty cents right so as you can< can see i've just manipulated the strike can see i've just manipulated the strike price< price previously i've used the one zero price previously i've used the one zero two< two point five and the hundred uh long two. point five and the hundred uh long put< put spread and then it gives me a larger put spread and then it gives me a larger credit< credit upfront credit upfront right< right but if the market goes down i do right but if the market goes down i do not< not make as much but now that i'm using not make as much but now that i'm using the< the 107. 5 strike with the 100 the 107.

5 strike with the 100 for< for the debit spread for the long put for the debit spread for the long put spread< spread then i'm going to be making much spread then i'm going to be making much more< more as the market goes down but if the more as the market goes down but if the market< market goes up then i'm not going to market goes up then i'm not going to make< make that much but if i have a long make that much but if i have a long stock< stock portfolio the long stock positions stock portfolio the long stock positions will< will all be making money all right so will all be making money all right so next< next is if you want to construct with a next is if you want to construct with a higher< higher probability of profit right if higher probability of profit right if. you< you want to have a higher probability of you want to have a higher probability of profit< profit this is where you can actually profit this is where you can actually construct< construct a put ratio spread with an add construct a put ratio spread with an add the< the money long strike right so let me the money long strike right so let me just< just remove all this again as well all just remove all this again as well all right< right again so we're going to be using right again so we're going to be using the< the short put the short pull is going to the short put the short pull is going to be< be at the 100 strike price and again for be at the 100 strike price and again for this< this we're going to receive a credit this we're going to receive a credit of of of 1. 65< 1.

65 cents roughly now so what do i mean 1. 65 cents roughly now so what do i mean by< by increasing the probability of profit by increasing the probability. of profit now< now previously we use this two strike now previously we use this two strike price< price right 102.

5 107. 5 right now the price right 102.

#### Topic 5

5 107. 5 right now the market< market is somewhere in between. 115 and market is somewhere in between 115 and 112.

5< 112. 5 right this is where the current 112.

5 right this is where the current market< market price is so for the current market price is so for. the current market< market price right let's say you take market price right let's say you take the< the 107. 5 it would take quite a while the 107.

5 it would take quite a while before< before the. market actually goes below before the market actually goes below 107. 5< 107.

5 that means for you to make money 107. 5 that means for you to make money on< on your embedded long put spread the on your embedded long put spread the market< market has to travel quite a bit first market has to travel quite a bit first before< before it can start to get into your before it can start to get into your embedded< embedded long put spread right and it embedded long put spread right and it has< has to go even further past the 100 for. has to go even further past the 100 for you< you to make the full profits on your you to make the full profits on your embedded< embedded long put spread but what if you embedded long put spread but what if you decided< decided to buy the add the money long decided to buy the add the money long strike< strike instead for your long put spread strike instead for your long put spread right< right so instead of buying the 107.

5 or right so instead of buying the 107. 5 or the< the 102.

5 what if i bought the 112. 5 the 102.

5 what if i bought the 112. 5 right< right so if i bought the walmart 2.

5 right so if i bought the walmart 2. 5 we< we need to be able to find the short we need to be able to find the short strike< strike the short leg of this put spread strike the. short leg of this put spread to< to be able to have a debit a total debit to be able to have a debit a total debit that's< that's lesser than 1.

#### Topic 6

65 cents all right that's lesser than 1. 65 cents all right so< so let's take a look at which is the so let's take a look at which is the short< short strike that we can use so again short strike that we can use so again we're< we're going to. take out our calculator we're going to take out our calculator so< so again so again let's< let's see how much we can get so let's let's see how much we can get so let's say< say if we were to buy the 112.

5 say if we were to buy the 112. 5 okay< okay so that would be minus one point okay so that would be minus one point five< five point zero five point zero three< three all right round it off five point three all right round it off five point zero< zero three and then we're gonna see. zero three and then we're gonna see which< which is the one that we can get roughly which is the one that we can get roughly one< one dollar and sixty-five cents so if one dollar and sixty-five cents so if you< you were to go to the one zero 107.

5 you were to go to the one zero 107. 5 strike< strike price let's say we're going to strike. price let's say we're going to buy< buy it for 3.

28 buy it for 3. 28 so< so in this case you can see we have to so in this case you can see we have to pay<. pay a dollar and 75 cents for this long pay a dollar and 75 cents for this long put< put spread of 112.

5 to 107. 5 right if put spread of 112.

5 to 107. 5 right if you< you were going to buy this two you were going to buy this two strike< strike for our long put spread then it's strike. for our long put spread then it's going< going to be a debit right because we're going to be a debit right because we're going< going to receive 1.

65 we're going to pay going to receive 1. 65 we're going to pay a< a dollar 75 cents this is going to give a dollar 75 cents this is going to give us< us a net debit of 10 or 10 cents right us a net debit of 10 or 10 cents right we're< we're going to. pay 10 to construct this we're going to pay 10 to construct this put< put ratio spread which is ideally not put ratio spread which is ideally not what< what we want so since we cannot sell what we want so since we cannot sell this< this uh 107.

5 what we want to do is try this uh 107. 5 what we want to do is try the< the one one zero right so the 110 will the one one zero right so the 110 will. most< most definitely give us a most definitely give us a overall< overall debit that is much lesser than overall debit that is much lesser than 1.

65< 1. 65 cents right so we're going to take 1.

#### Topic 7

65 cents right so we're going to take this< this again so. we're going to take this again so we're going to take 5. 03< 5.

03 and then we are going to edit by 5. 03 and then we are going to edit by 4.

08 4. 08 4.

08 all< all right so this gives us all right so this gives us 95< 95 cents in debit right so this is just 95 cents in debit right. so this is just nice< nice right we are going to have a debit nice right we are going to have a debit of< of minus of minus 0. 95< 0.

95 which is going to give us a credit 0. 95 which is going to give us a credit of< of roughly 70 cents if my mets didn't of roughly 70 cents if my mets didn't fail< fail me right we're probably going to fail me right we're probably going to get< get 70 cents in credit and we're going get 70 cents in credit and we're going to< to have this to strike price as our long to have this to strike price as our long put< put spread so that means for us to make put spread so that means for us to make the< the full the full profit< profit of this underlying profit of this underlying long< long put spread the market just has to long put spread the market just has to go< go down and expire right at one one zero go down and expire right at one one zero below< below right below one one zero if the below right below one one zero if the market< market is somewhere in between anywhere market is somewhere in between anywhere from< from 100 to 110 we're going to be uh from 100 to 110 we're going to be uh making< making the full profits in our long put making the full profits in our long put spread< spread which is 250 dollars and we won't spread which is. 250 dollars and we won't get< get assigned on the short put because get assigned on the short put because the< the market did not close below 100 the market did not close below 100 points< points so this way as you can see there points so this way as you can see there is< is a higher probability of profit is a higher probability of profit because< because it's easier for the market to go because it's easier for the market to go below< below 110 than it is to go below you below 110 than it is to go below you know< know previously we had the strike price know previously we had the strike price at< at one zero seven point five two hundred at one zero seven point five two hundred you're< you're right it's going to be much you're right it's going to be much easier< easier for you to go below one on zero easier for you to go below one on zero than< than it is to go below one zero seven than it is to go below one zero seven point< point five all the way to a hundred point five all the way to a hundred right< right previously we also use another right previously we also use another example< example which is one zero 102.

5 100 example which is one zero 102. 5 100 right< right it's going to be much easier for right it's going to be much easier for the< the market. to drop below 110 than it is the market to drop below 110 than it is to< to go below right 102.

5 to 100. so that to go below right 102.

5 to 100. so that is< is how you can actually construct the is how you can actually construct the put< put ratio spread right your short put put ratio spread right your short put or< or rather the short length of your long or rather the short length of your long put< put spread does not have to be the same put spread does not have to be the same strike< strike as your strike as your additional< additional short put right you can just additional short put right you can just change< change it around anywhere on this put change it around anywhere on this put option< option table down here right next what option table down here right next what if< if you want to construct for a higher if you want to construct for a higher profit< profit potential so this way so what you profit potential so this way so what you want< want to do down here is you want to want to do down here is you want to create< create a a puts raise spread without the create a a puts raise spread without the money< money long strike so in this case money long strike so in this case instead< instead of us buying the long put spread instead of us buying the long put spread which< which is somewhere at the money you can which is somewhere at the money you can shift< shift it somewhere down right you can shift it somewhere down right you can push< push it further push it further further< further out of the money because when further. out of the money because when your< your long push spread is further out of your long push spread is further out of the< the money it becomes cheaper right your the money it becomes cheaper right your long< long put spread is cheaper for the out long put spread is cheaper for the out of< of the money that it is at the money all of the money that it is at the money all right< right so let's get into a trade example right so let's get into a trade example so< so you can take a look exactly what i so you can take a look exactly what i mean< mean by the way if you found this video mean by the way if you found this video helpful< helpful so far please give me a thumbs helpful so far please give me a thumbs up< up and also subscribe to my channel so i up and also subscribe to my channel so i can< can create more videos like this for you can create more videos like this for you in< in the future okay back to the video in the future okay back to the video alright< alright so i've just recently put on a alright so i've just recently put on a put< put ratio spread on google so as you can put ratio spread on google so as you can see< see these are the strikes that i've see these are the strikes that i've chosen< chosen for the long put spread i've chosen for the long put spread i've chosen< chosen 112.

5 and 110 so this will be the chosen 112. 5 and 110 so this will be the maximum< maximum profit down here maximum profit down here. and< and then my short put strike is at and then my short put strike is at 102.

#### Topic 8

5< 102. 5 which is just at the previous low 102.

5 which is just at the previous low down< down here and also below this support down here and also below this support level< level so as you can see this is what i'm level so as you can see this is what i'm talking< talking about talking about previously< previously where i want the short put previously where. i want the short put strike< strike right the additional short put strike right the additional short put strike< strike to be below at or below the strike to be below at or below the support< support level so in this case it's just support level so in this case it's just nice< nice i have it at 102. 5 and then in this nice i have it at 102.

5 and then in this case< case i decided to go for a higher case i decided to go for a higher probability< probability kind of a trade as mentioned probability kind of a trade as mentioned previously< previously you mentioned i said that previously you mentioned i said that there< there is a higher probability of profit there is a higher probability of. profit where< where i go for the at the money long where i go for the at the money long strike< strike for the embedded long put spread strike for the embedded long put spread so< so in this case i decided to go for the so in this case i decided to go for the long< long put spread there's one more 2. 5 and long put spread there's one more 2.

5 and 110< 110 so this way i have a higher chance 110 so this way i have a higher chance for< for the market for the market for< for to make money on this embedded long for to make money on this embedded long put< put spread because the market just has put spread because the market just has to< to go down here at expiration and i'm to go down here at expiration and i'm going< going to make the full profits on this going to make the full profits on this embedded< embedded long put spread so for this embedded long put spread so for this whole< whole spread down here i receive a whole spread down here i receive a credit< credit of one dollars and 12 cents which credit of one dollars and 12 cents which is< is a hundred and twelve dollars. that is a hundred and twelve dollars that means< means even if the market was to shoot up means even if the market was to shoot up it's< it's not like i don't get paid right i it's not like i don't get paid right i still< still get a dollar and 12 cents for this still get a dollar and 12 cents for this so< so as always we always want to plan out so as always we always want to plan out our< our different scenarios so you know our different scenarios so you know exactly< exactly what to do when the market gets exactly what to do when the market gets to< to the different places all right so the to the different places all right so the first< first scenario is what if google goes first scenario is what if google goes above< above 112. 5 at expiration right so 112.

5 above 112. 5 at expiration right so 112.

5 is< is the beginning of our put ratio spread is the beginning of our put ratio spread this< this is where my long put option is at this is where my long put option is at so< so now the market is above down here so so now the market is above down here so it< it means that the put ratio spread it means that the put ratio spread expires< expires worthless so straightforward i expires worthless so straightforward i just< just collect the full credit that i just collect the full credit that i received< received for selling this put ratio received. for selling this put ratio spread< spread which is 112 dollars right so spread which is 112 dollars right so once< once this expires i'm going to reassess once this expires i'm going to reassess the< the whole position again i'm going to the whole position again i'm going to take< take a look see whether am i going to take a look see whether am i going to enter< enter into another put ratio spread or enter into another put ratio spread or not< not okay scenario number two what if not okay scenario number two what if google< google is in between moment 2. 5 and 110 google is in between moment 2.

5 and 110 expiration< expiration that means it's in between expiration that means it's in between your< your long put spread so in this case on your long put spread so in this case on expiration< expiration day itself right on expiration day itself right on expiration< expiration day itself before the market expiration day itself before the market closes< closes i'm going to close this long put closes i'm going to close this long put spread< spread for a profit right regardless of spread for a profit right regardless of where< where it is as long as it's below this where it is as long as it's below this long< long put option i'm going to close it long put option i'm going to close it and< and the reason is because if you're and the reason is because if you're going< going to take this to expiration your going to take this to expiration your broker< broker is going to exercise this long broker is going to exercise this long put< put option it means you're going to be put option it means you're going to be short< short 100 shares so to avoid this short 100 shares so to avoid this assignment< assignment thing you're going to want to assignment thing you're going to want to close< close it just before the market closes close it just before the market closes all< all right so you can just close it out all right so you can just close it out take< take the profit and then the next thing take the profit and then the next thing is< is that your shopper is going to ex it's is that your shopper is going to ex it's going< going to expire worthless going to expire worthless so< so your total profit is going to be 112 so your total profit is going to be 112 plus< plus the credit you receive from selling plus the credit you receive from selling the< the long put spread now what about the long put spread now what about scenario< scenario. 3 what if google is in between scenario 3 what if google is in between hundred< hundred and ten dollars and hundred and hundred and ten dollars and hundred and twelve< twelve dollars at fifty cents and twelve dollars at fifty cents and expiration< expiration that means he's expiration that means he's well< well past your long uh put spread but well past your long uh put spread but it's< it's above your short put option so in it's above your short put option so in this< this case your long put spread will be this case your long put spread will be at< at max profit in this case you can close at max profit in this case you can close it< it out for max profit or you can just it out for max profit or you can just leave< leave it to expire versus because your leave it to expire versus because your broker< broker will net match these two options broker will net match these two options off< off so that you won't be off so that you won't be as< as assigned or exercise on this because as assigned or exercise on this because they< they will just cancel it out each other they will just cancel it out each other and< and you're just going to get the profit and you're just going to get the profit from< from it and then your short put is going from it and then your short put is going to< to expire worthless and you're going to to expire worthless and you're going to receive< receive a total of 112 plus 250 dollars receive a total of 112 plus 250 dollars which< which is which is 362< 362 dollars all right so that is for 362 dollars all right so that is for scenario< scenario number three now scenario scenario number three now scenario number< number four is what if the market goes number four is what if the market goes below< below your short put strike below your short put strike right< right at 102. 5 so in this case you're right at 102.

5 so in this case you're going< going to have the max profit again on going to have the max profit again on your< your long put spread this time your your long put spread this time your short< short put is going to be. assigned as we short put is going to be assigned as we have< have already planned for so that means have already planned for so that means we're< we're going to get long 100 shares at we're going to get long 100 shares at 102. 5 102.

5 102. 5 and< and that means we're going to have a and that means we're going to have a total< total profit of 362 dollars as well and total. profit of 362 dollars as well and then< then now you're going to be long 100 then now you're going to be long 100 shares< shares and 102.

#### Topic 9

50 shares and 102. 50 so< so at this point of time right once so at this point of time right once you're< you're long you can wait for the market you're long you can wait for the market to< to go back up first before you sell a to go back up first before you sell a covered< covered call or you could just hold it covered call or you could just hold it out< out until the market goes further up out until the market goes further up then< then you decide to sell a cover call or then you decide to sell a cover call or get< get out of your position all right so get out of your position all right so this< this is the game plan i have on when i this is the game plan i have on when i put< put on my put ratio spread so when you put on my put ratio spread so when you put< put on your put ratio spread as well you put on your put ratio spread as well you want< want to map out all the different want to map out all the different scenarios< scenarios so you know exactly what to do scenarios so you know exactly what to do even< even before the market gets to the even before the market gets to the different< different scenarios right so many times different scenarios right so many times that< that there are a lot of traders that that there are a lot of traders that they< they do come and. ask you know what's they do come and ask you know what's going< going to happen if the market goes you going to happen if the market goes you know< know below here what do i do what should know below here what do i do what should i< i do so all this has to be planned out i do so all this has to be planned out even< even before you place the trade so that even before you place the trade so that means< means the moment you place this trade means the moment you place this trade you< you receive this credit at this point you receive this credit at this point it's< it's all going to be mechanical you're it's all going to be mechanical you're just< just going to execute the plan according just going to execute the plan according to< to what happens uh that you have planned to what happens uh that you have planned out< out for the different scenario all right out for the different scenario all right guys< guys so i hope this video has been guys so i hope this video has been helpful< helpful for you if it has please give me helpful for you if it has please give me a< a thumbs up as well as subscribe to my a thumbs up as well as subscribe to my channel< channel for more videos like this and as channel for more videos like this and as always< always thank you for watching appreciate always thank you for watching appreciate your<

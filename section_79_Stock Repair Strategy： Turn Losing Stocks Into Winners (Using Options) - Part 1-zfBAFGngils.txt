===============================================================================================

Language: en all< all right so this is part one on how to all right so this is part one on how to repair< repair a losing stock position using repair a losing stock position using options< options so if right now you have a options so if right now you have a losing< losing stock position or maybe you have losing stock position or maybe you have several< several losing stock positions then you several losing stock positions then you definitely< definitely want to watch this video all definitely want to watch this video all the< the way to the end because i'm going to the way to the end because i'm going to share< share with you how you can increase the share with you how you can increase the chances< chances of you break even and even chances of you break even and even increase< increase the profitability of your stock increase the profitability of your stock position< position using options so position using options so before< before you repair your losing stock before you repair your losing stock position< position you want to first understand position you want to first understand the< the term repair what does it exactly the term repair what does it exactly mean< mean so repairing your losing positions mean so repairing your losing positions just< just basically means to lower the just basically means to lower the average< average price of your stock by buying average price of your stock by buying more< more shares below your entry price this more shares below your entry price this is< is the essence of how you actually is the essence of how you actually repair< repair your stock positions. because if repair your stock positions because if the< the price if your average price is lower the price if your average price is lower then< then it means that you can easily break then it means that you can easily break even< even so for example if you bought your even so for example if you bought your stock< stock at 100 stock at 100 and< and the price right now is at eighty and the price right now is at eighty dollars< dollars you're down twenty percent right dollars you're down twenty percent right for< for the stock to for the stock to get< get back to break even it has to move get back to break even it has to move twenty< twenty dollars and twenty dollars twenty dollars and twenty dollars on< on an eighty dollars price right now on an eighty dollars price right now that< that is a 25 move so it has to move 25 that is a 25 move so it has to move 25 upwards< upwards in order for you to uh break upwards in order for you to uh break even< even but if you were to just buy another even but if you were to just buy another 100< 100 shares right now you would buy again 100 shares right now you would buy again right< right now 80 right now 80 your< your average price would become ninety your average price would become ninety dollars< dollars so now it only has to move up dollars so now it only has to move up ten< ten dollars for you to break even so ten dollars for you to break even so that< that is just 12. 5 percent is definitely that is just 12.

5 percent is definitely much< much easier to achieve compared to a 25 much easier to achieve compared to a 25 move< move in the stock move in the stock so< so what do you want to repair so first so what do you want to repair so first of< of all it increases your chances of of all it increases your chances of break< break even like i explained earlier a break even like i explained earlier a lower< lower average price means your stock lower average price means your stock does< does not have to move as much just to does not have to move as much just to break< break even it also helps increase your break even it also helps increase your profitability< profitability when it's above your profitability when it's above your average< average price so if your average price average price so if your average price is< is 90 let's say is 90 let's say and< and if you had a 100 shares before and if you had a 100 shares before every< every dollar move would just mean a every dollar move would just mean a hundred< hundred dollars hundred dollars in< in profit right but if you average in in profit right but if you average in and< and you bought another 100 shares so now and you bought another 100 shares so now you< you have a total of 200 shares that you have a total of 200 shares that means< means that every dollar above your means that every dollar above your average< average price would be 200 in profit so average price would be 200 in profit so it< it increases your profitability it increases your profitability and< and it's also a good deal because if you and it's also a good deal because if you think< think about it the reason why you want think about it the reason why you want to< to get into your stock position and i'd to get into your stock position and i'd assume< assume that you are assume that you are investing< investing in these stocks for the long investing in these stocks for the long term term term is< is that you see the mentality is that if is that you see the mentality is that if you< you waited for the stock to drop to 100 you waited for the stock to drop to 100 you< you wanted to buy it because you thought you wanted to buy it because you thought that< that was a good deal otherwise you would that was a good deal otherwise you would you< you wouldn't have gone in in the first you wouldn't have gone in in the first place< place right so if you like the stock at place right so if you like the stock at 100< 100 then you would love the stock even 100 then you would love the stock even more< more if it dropped to 80 or 60 or even more if it dropped to 80 or 60 or even lower< lower than that right so then it's a lower than that right so then it's a good< good time for you to good time for you to buy< buy again buy again because< because if your idea your direction of because if your idea your direction of the< the stock is that it will go up in the the stock is that it will go up in the long< long term then long term then it< it makes sense for you to just keep it makes sense for you to just keep buying< buying as it drops as long as you got buying as it drops as long as you got your< your risk management in place and you your risk management in place and you have< have enough capital to hold on to the have enough capital to hold on to the stocks< stocks right now this is very important stocks right now this is very important to< to understand to understand while< while repairing your stock actually while repairing your stock actually increases< increases your chances of break even and increases your chances of break even and also< also increases profitability it also also increases profitability it also increases< increases your risk that's because increases your risk that's because you're< you're actually adding more capital to you're actually adding more capital to the< the stock right you're adding more and the stock right you're adding more and more< more money so if you had a hundred more money so if you had a hundred shares< shares at a hundred dollars your capital shares at a hundred dollars your capital is< is ten thousand dollars is ten thousand dollars and< and if the price drops to eighty dollars and if the price drops to eighty dollars and< and you buy another hundred shares then and you buy another hundred shares then you< you are adding another eight thousand you are adding another eight thousand dollars< dollars in capital so now your total dollars in capital so now your total capital< capital that you put into the stock is capital that you put into the stock is eighteen< eighteen thousand dollars now if for eighteen thousand dollars now if for some< some reason some reason the< the stock does go to zero you would have the stock does go to zero you would have lost< lost the full eighteen thousand dollars lost the full eighteen thousand dollars compared< compared to if you hadn't repaired the compared to if you hadn't repaired the stock< stock you hadn't bought again you would stock you hadn't bought again you would have< have only just lost ten thousand dollars have only just lost ten thousand dollars so< so this is very important to understand so this is very important to understand so< so while repairing means you are so while repairing means you are increasing< increasing the chances of break even and increasing the chances of break even and increasing< increasing your profitability you are increasing your profitability you are also< also increasing your risk also increasing your risk that< that is why you only want to repair that is why you only want to repair stocks< stocks that you are confident in stocks that you are confident in investing< investing for the long run you don't investing for the long run you don't want< want to be repairing on stocks that want to be repairing on stocks that you're< you're unsure of that you're not sure or you're unsure of that you're not sure or if< if the stock is a speculative stock if the stock is a speculative stock you're< you're not sure whether it's going to go you're not sure whether it's going to go up< up then that's not a stock that you want up then that's not a stock that you want to< to repair on instead you might just to repair on instead you might just consider< consider either reducing your position consider either reducing your position or< or you might just want to cut the or you might just want to cut the position position position altogether< altogether and take a loss on it alright altogether and take a loss on it alright so< so repairing is only if you want to so repairing is only if you want to invest< invest in the stock for the long run so invest in the stock for the long run so here< here are questions that you want to ask here are questions that you want to ask yourself< yourself before repairing a stock yourself before repairing a stock so< so the first question is has there been so the first question is has there been any< any fundamental changes in the stock any fundamental changes in the stock like< like for example maybe the business like for example maybe the business direction< direction or the business focus has direction or the business focus has changed changed changed right< right they may pivot from one uh right they may pivot from one uh source< source of profit to another source and source of profit to another source and if< if this fundamental change is not if this fundamental change is not something< something that you think may work out in something that you think may work out in the< the long run then you might not want to the long run then you might not want to you< you know uh repair the stock because you know uh repair the stock because you're< you're not sure how it's going to turn you're not sure how it's going to turn out< out you're not sure if the stock will out you're not sure if the stock will still< still be profitable in the long run still be profitable in the long run you< you know you know meta< meta which is formerly known as facebook meta which is formerly known as facebook they< they had started to invest very heavily they had started to invest very heavily into< into the metaverse world now there are into the metaverse world now there are some< some investors that feel that they have some investors that feel that they have sort< sort of changed their fundamentals sort of changed their fundamentals because< because previously they were just because previously they were just focusing< focusing on their ad revenue you know focusing on their ad revenue you know through< through the facebook platforms through the facebook platforms and< and also other advertising channels that and also other advertising channels that they< they have acquired over the years they have acquired over the years so< so many of us seems to be something new so many of us seems to be something new and< and some investors just see that as a and some investors just see that as a change< change and they may not think that it's change and they may not think that it's going< going to be profitable because at this going to be profitable because at this point< point of time it is still considered a point of time it is still considered a bad< bad we're not sure that metaphors could bad we're not sure that metaphors could work< work out where people will actually work out where people will actually adopt< adopt metaverse and everyone will start adopt metaverse and everyone will start using< using it so if you're unsure you know using it so if you're unsure you know some< some investors might just want to cut some investors might just want to cut you< you know the losses on facebook on meta you know the losses on facebook on meta or< or they might just not repair it so it or they might just not repair it so it is< is your personal view is your personal view next< next has your view on the stock change next has your view on the stock change right< right some people might say that hey right some people might say that hey metaverse< metaverse is the next thing metaverse is the next thing it< it might be a revolutionary thing where it might be a revolutionary thing where it< it can change the industry and everybody it can change the industry and everybody will< will start to adopt it right you know will start to adopt it right you know always< always the first mover always the first mover of< of uh an industry of uh an industry tend< tend to tend to be be be successful< successful if it does catch on if we successful if it does catch on if we catch< catch on they are the first mover catch on they are the first mover they'll< they'll normally get the biggest market they'll normally get the biggest market share< share so share so has< has your view on the stock change if has your view on the stock change if your< your view on the stock has changed you your view on the stock has changed you think< think that it's not going to think that it's not going to be< be as profitable in the future then you be as profitable in the future then you do< do not want to repair on the stock you do not want to repair on the stock you might< might just want to just hold on to the might just want to just hold on to the stock< stock and see what happens or maybe just stock and see what happens or maybe just reduce< reduce your position reduce your position and< and finally and most importantly is that and finally and most importantly is that do< do you have enough funds to allocate to do you have enough funds to allocate to the< the stock because if you want to use the stock because if you want to use options< options to options to repair< repair your stocks and and buy more you repair your stocks and and buy more you for< for each option you need to be able to for each option you need to be able to buy< buy a hundred shares of the stock so buy a hundred shares of the stock so let's< let's say for example if let's say for example if the< the this stock has dropped 80 the this stock has dropped 80 you< you want to buy this stock you have to you want to buy this stock you have to buy< buy at 100 shares of it and the total buy. at 100 shares of it and the total capital< capital for that is eight thousand capital for that is eight thousand dollars< dollars so you want to make sure that dollars so you want to make sure that you< you have eight thousand dollars you have eight thousand dollars uh< uh to put into this stock at this price uh to put into this stock at this price you< you know a lot of people you know a lot of people or< or rather i see some people that have or rather i see some people that have been< been teaching regarding repairing been teaching regarding repairing they're< they're thinking of uh just selling a they're thinking of uh just selling a premium< premium on the options premium on the options but< but they are not uh thinking that if the but they are not uh thinking that if the option< option was to exercise they have to option was to exercise they have to fulfill< fulfill on the whole uh hundred shares fulfill on the whole uh hundred shares right< right they just try to right they just try to sculpt< sculpt here and there just to reduce the sculpt here and there just to reduce the cost< cost price of the stock now it cost price of the stock now it definitely< definitely works fine if you know what definitely works fine if you know what you're< you're doing and you're able to cut when you're doing and you're able to cut when it< it goes wrong but if you're not sure and it goes wrong but if you're not sure and you< you don't know how to manage it properly you don't know how to manage it properly it< it can really get deep it can really get deep into< into the money on your option and you're into the money on your option and you're going< going to get exercise and during that going to get exercise and during that time< time the broker is going to ask you to time the broker is going to ask you to put< put up that money to buy that 100 shares put up that money to buy that 100 shares of< of stock and if you do not have the of stock and if you do not have the money money money then then then it< it may run into some trouble you may be it may run into some trouble you may be asked< asked to liquidate most of the position asked to liquidate most of the position and< and you may have to cut loss on your and you may have to cut loss on your stock< stock when stock when it< it could actually go up many years from it could actually go up many years from now< now so this is very important for you to now so this is very important for you to understand understand understand so< so then in general right just three ways so then in general right just three ways to< to repair a losing stock position so the to repair a losing stock position so the traditional< traditional way would be dollar cost traditional way would be dollar cost averaging< averaging so dollar cost averaging if averaging so dollar cost averaging if you< you don't already know is basically just you don't already know is basically just putting< putting a fixed sum of money at every putting a fixed sum of money at every fixed< fixed interval let's say every month you fixed interval let's say every month you put< put in say a thousand dollars to buy the put in say a thousand dollars to buy the stock< stock regardless where the stock is stock regardless where the stock is right< right so at this point of time when the right so at this point of time when the if< if the market you know has gone below if the market you know has gone below your< your entry price any amount that you put your entry price any amount that you put in< in to in to buy< buy the stock would always be resulting buy the stock would always be resulting in< in a lower average price so this is on a in a lower average price so this is on a fixed< fixed monthly basis with fixed amount of fixed monthly basis with fixed amount of money money money next< next is price averaging so price next is price averaging so price averaging< averaging basically just means to buy as averaging basically just means to buy as the< the price drop so instead of the price drop so instead of using< using time to enter into the market using time to enter into the market which< which dollar cost averaging is price which dollar cost averaging is price averaging< averaging just you know just based on averaging just you know just based on the< the price so if you're 100 it drops to the price so if you're 100 it drops to 80< 80 dollars you enter it drops to 60 then 80 dollars you enter it drops to 60 then you< you enter again so that is basically you enter again so that is basically price< price averaging and the third way is price averaging and the third way is through< through options and through options and in< in my personal opinion is the best way in my personal opinion is the best way for< for you to repair because you're able to for you to repair because you're able to collect< collect some premium on it and most of collect some premium on it and most of the< the time when we talk about repairing we the time when we talk about repairing we generally< generally want to collect premium but generally want to collect premium but i'll< i'll also share with you another method i'll also share with you another method that that that it's< it's not premium collecting but helps it's not premium collecting but helps you< you reduce you reduce your< your risk on the downside and have some your risk on the downside and have some leverage< leverage on the upside as well alright leverage on the upside as well alright so so so there< there are three options strategies that there are three options strategies that i'm< i'm going to share with you that you can i'm going to share with you that you can use< use to repair losing stock positions use to repair losing stock positions now< now the first method is the cash secure now the first method is the cash secure output output output so< so the cash secure put is simply selling so the cash secure put is simply selling a< a put option and having enough funds to a put option and having enough funds to purchase< purchase the 100 shares per contract of purchase the 100 shares per contract of the< the underlying stock if exercise so the underlying stock if exercise so very< very quickly a put option is just the very quickly a put option is just the right< right to sell the stock at a certain right to sell the stock at a certain price< price if you buy the put option you have price if you buy the put option you have the< the right to sell the stock at a certain the right to sell the stock at a certain price< price so basically that's what a lot of price so basically that's what a lot of investors< investors use as a way to insure their investors use as a way to insure their portfolio< portfolio so if you bought a stock at portfolio so if you bought a stock at 100 100 100 and< and they bought a put option at 90 and they bought a put option at 90 and< and if the stock was to drop below 90 it and if the stock was to drop below 90 it just< just means that just means that they< they have the right to exercise the they have the right to exercise the option< option and sell their stock off at 90 option and sell their stock off at 90 shoot< shoot the stock drop below that right so shoot the stock drop below that right so this< this is a form of insurance like if the this is a form of insurance like if the market< market was to crash all the way to 50 on market was to crash all the way to 50 on your< your stock your stock you< you could exercise the option and you you could exercise the option and you only< only lose 10 dollars per share right so only lose 10 dollars per share right so this< this is the cash secure output but what this is the cash secure output but what we're< we're going to use it is we are actually we're going to use it is we are actually going< going to sell the cash secure put to get going to sell the cash secure put to get premium< premium and then use it as a form of premium and then use it as a form of getting< getting into the stock at a lower price getting into the stock at a lower price to< to lower the average price of our stock to lower the average price of our stock so< so that's the cash secure put so the so that's the cash secure put so the idea< idea here is to continually reduce the idea here is to continually reduce the cost< cost basis of the stock so i'm going to cost basis of the stock so i'm going to give< give you a visual illustration here so give you a visual illustration here so you< you can better understand what i mean so you can better understand what i mean so this< this imagine is just uh well this is my this imagine is just uh well this is my diagram< diagram at least of a stock that is diagram at least of a stock that is moving< moving up okay so you see the stock is moving up okay so you see the stock is forming< forming a higher high higher low higher forming a higher high higher low higher high< high so at this point of time you might high so at this point of time you might think< think that hey the stock is going up so think that hey the stock is going up so i< i want to wait for the stock to retrace i want to wait for the stock to retrace you< you know to pull back then i will enter you know to pull back then i will enter so so so true< true enough the stock has a pullback true enough the stock has a pullback he< he has retraced and he decided hey i he has retraced and he decided hey i want< want to buy a hundred shares here so you want to buy a hundred shares here so you buy< buy 100 shares here and the price is buy 100 shares here and the price is hundred< hundred dollars so at this point of time hundred dollars so at this point of time let's< let's say the stock started to go up you let's say the stock started to go up you think< think to yourself maybe hey i'm a genius think to yourself maybe hey i'm a genius then< then all of a sudden the stock crashes then all of a sudden the stock crashes you< you know the economy is not doing well you know the economy is not doing well fed< fed raises interest rate all that stuff fed raises interest rate all that stuff the< the news come and there's a big crash the news come and there's a big crash and< and now the stock has dropped way below and now the stock has dropped way below your< your entry price so what do you do now your entry price so what do you do now so< so the idea here is to sell a cash so the idea here is to sell a cash secure< secure put so let's say you have secure put so let's say you have identified< identified the level that you want to identified the level that you want to enter< enter the next batch of 100 shares that enter the next batch of 100 shares that you< you want to you want to buy< buy the shares at it's 80 so what you do buy the shares at it's 80 so what you do you< you sell the cash to carpool and let's you sell the cash to carpool and let's say< say you create you collect a dollar in say you create you collect a dollar in terms< terms of premium for it so this dollar terms of premium for it so this dollar of< of premium of premium will< will offset the entry price that you will offset the entry price that you bought< bought at so now your average price bought at so now your average price would< would be 99 would be 99 so< so let's say the market starts to move so let's say the market starts to move and< and at expiration date it closes above and at expiration date it closes above your< your cash secure output of the strike of your cash secure output of the strike of 80. < 80.

so what this happens is that your 80. so what this happens is that your cash< cash secure put now expired worthless cash secure put now expired worthless you< you collect the full one dollar you collect the full one dollar and< and then you can sell another cash and then you can sell another cash secure< secure put at the same strike again secure put at the same strike again maybe< maybe collect a dollar in credit so this maybe collect a dollar in credit so this dollar< dollar again will contribute to reducing dollar again will contribute to reducing the< the cost basis of your stock and now the cost basis of your stock and now your< your average price becomes 98 your average price becomes 98 so< so then again you let the price move so then again you let the price move then< then again the price then again the price it< it may drop below your it may drop below your option< option very briefly your strike and then option very briefly your strike and then goes< goes back up and closes above again goes back up and closes above again again< again what happens your cash to kill put again what happens your cash to kill put expire< expire worthless you collect the one expire worthless you collect the one dollar< dollar credit so at this point you can dollar credit so at this point you can then< then sell again then sell again sell< sell another cash to output at that sell another cash to output at that strike< strike price so you get the point you strike price so you get the point you just< just want to keep selling and selling just want to keep selling and selling and< and gradually reduce the average price and gradually reduce the average price until< until you finally get exercise on the until you finally get exercise on the cash< cash output now remember our goal with cash output now remember our goal with the< the cashier output the cashier output is< is to get exercise we want to buy we is to get exercise we want to buy we want< want to get fuel at eighty dollars want to get fuel at eighty dollars we< we want to buy a hundred shares and we want to buy a hundred shares and eighty< eighty dollars to reduce the overall eighty dollars to reduce the overall average< average price and meanwhile while doing average price and meanwhile while doing that< that we can keep collecting the premium that we can keep collecting the premium to< to reduce the price as well right we are to reduce the price as well right we are not not not in< in this game we're not doing cash secure in this game we're not doing cash secure output< output so that we don't get fuel right output so that we don't get fuel right the< the idea here is we want to get fuel the idea here is we want to get fuel because< because we feel that this is a good because we feel that this is a good stock< stock if we liked it at a hundred stock if we liked it at a hundred dollars< dollars we definitely like it at 80 so dollars we definitely like it at 80 so that< that is the mindset that you want to get that is the mindset that you want to get into into into as< as you do this cash 2 output so as you do this cash 2 output so now< now that you have collected two dollars now that you have collected two dollars in< in credit again this reduces the cost in credit again this reduces the cost that< that you paid for the stock so now it that you paid for the stock so now it becomes< becomes 96 dollars becomes 96 dollars so< so let's say again price the stock moves so let's say again price the stock moves and< and at expiration date it closes below and at expiration date it closes below your< your strike price at this point of time your strike price at this point of time your< your cash output will be exercised so at your cash output will be exercised so at this< this point of time you will need to buy this point of time you will need to buy the< the stock at eighty dollars you need to the stock at eighty dollars you need to buy< buy a hundred shares and put up eight buy a hundred shares and put up eight thousand< thousand dollars so right now thousand dollars so right now your< your effective price your average price your effective price your average price becomes< becomes 88 becomes 88 so< so as you can see we have uh lowered our so as you can see we have uh lowered our average< average price from 100 average price from 100 to< to 88 dollars so this is the whole idea to 88 dollars so this is the whole idea of< of using the cash secure output to of using the cash secure output to repair< repair your stock you get a lower repair your stock you get a lower average< average price so this time if the price average price so this time if the price was< was to rally back up to our original was to rally back up to our original price< price which we bought at of 100 price which we bought at of 100 now< now we would actually be sitting at a now we would actually be sitting at a profit< profit of 12 per stock profit of 12 per stock and< and now instead of uh and now instead of uh being< being break even we actually have a being break even we actually have a profit< profit because our average price right profit because our average price right now< now is 88 and we have 200 shares now is 88 and we have 200 shares with< with 12 per share profit so that's with 12 per share profit so that's roughly roughly roughly four< four hundred dollars so as you can see four hundred dollars so as you can see we< we have used the cash output to increase we have used the cash output to increase i< i mean to increase our profitability as i mean to increase our profitability as well< well the reduce the average price well the reduce the average price so< so if the price was to just go back just so if the price was to just go back just to< to the price that we entered at we would to the price that we entered at we would even< even profit okay so even profit okay so here< here are five steps to repair your here are five steps to repair your stocks< stocks using the cash secure output so stocks using the cash secure output so step< step one is to first identify how much step one is to first identify how much more< more funds you can allocate the stock more funds you can allocate the stock again< again very important money management is again very important money management is very< very important you don't want you don't very important you don't want you don't want< want to put yourself in a position where want to put yourself in a position where you< you do not have enough money to fulfill you do not have enough money to fulfill the the the assignment< assignment of the shares and then your assignment of the shares and then your broker< broker may have to liquidate your broker may have to liquidate your position< position and you have to cut loss when position and you have to cut loss when your< your intention is to hold on to the your intention is to hold on to the stock stock stock step< step number two you want to identify the step number two you want to identify the level< level or levels at which you want to buy level or levels at which you want to buy the< the stock at and it's either at the the stock at and it's either at the price< price level or percentage level so for price level or percentage level so for example< example if you bought a hundred dollars example if you bought a hundred dollars you< you may identify the next level that you you may identify the next level that you want< want to enter say at 80 want to enter say at 80 so< so that's the price where you want to so that's the price where you want to uh< uh sell the next cash output right or uh sell the next cash output right or you< you may say it's in terms of percentage you may say it's in terms of percentage so< so for me i like to see in terms of so for me i like to see in terms of percentage< percentage so for example percentage so for example i< i generally if i want to repair a stock i generally if i want to repair a stock i< i would like to have two levels from i would like to have two levels from after< after my entry level so makes a total of after my entry level so makes a total of three< three levels so my entry level the mid three levels so my entry level the mid level< level and the last level uh to finally level and the last level uh to finally average< average in uh for my stocks average in uh for my stocks so< so how would determine the last level so how would determine the last level generally< generally would be always around the 50 generally would be always around the 50 level< level because normally that's the time level because normally that's the time where< where uh where uh stocks stocks stocks most< most of the time stocks do not really most of the time stocks do not really drop< drop all the way to the 50 level unless drop all the way to the 50 level unless it's< it's like a market crash or bear market it's like a market crash or bear market so so so if< if the stock can actually drop to the 50 if the stock can actually drop to the 50 level level level it< it is actually a very good price to get it is actually a very good price to get it< it and to get in at it and to get in at i< i mean i mean considering< considering that you know the considering that you know the fundamentals< fundamentals hasn't changed your view on fundamentals hasn't changed your view on the< the stock is still there then getting in the stock is still there then getting in at< at a 50 level at a 50 level is< is a very good entry price so that is is a very good entry price so that is where< where i want to lock in the final level where i want to lock in the final level for< for my cash secure output so if it goes for my cash secure output so if it goes to< to that. point in time i'm definitely to that point in time i'm definitely going< going to want to get in going to want to get in so< so the first so the first cache< cache output that i'll be selling will cache output that i'll be selling will basically< basically be the midpoint between the basically be the midpoint between the entry< entry level and the 50 level so let's entry level and the 50 level so let's say< say for example i entered say for example i entered at< at 100 at 100 i< i might see that the 50 level for me i might see that the 50 level for me would< would be at 50 dollars would be at 50 dollars right< right so in this case the midpoint would right so in this case the midpoint would just< just be 75 dollars so if right now the just be 75 dollars so if right now the stock< stock is somewhere around 90 dollars stock is somewhere around 90 dollars i'll< i'll be just waiting i'll be just waiting to< to sell the cash output at 75 dollars to sell the cash output at 75 dollars and< and i'll keep you know doing this sell and i'll keep you know doing this sell this< this cash secure output until you this cash secure output until you finally< finally get exercise if there's an finally get exercise if there's an exercise< exercise i'll be looking at the next exercise i'll be looking at the next cash< cash flow output which is at fifty cash flow output which is at fifty dollars dollars dollars okay< okay so step number three is to look for okay so step number three is to look for the< the options with the days to expiration the options with the days to expiration of< of 30 to 45 days because that is of 30 to 45 days because that is generally< generally the time where generally the time where the< the decay starts to really increase it's the decay starts to really increase it's always< always the last 30 to 45 days of an always the last 30 to 45 days of an option option option now< now some people have actually asked now some people have actually asked whether< whether they can sell the weekly options whether they can sell the weekly options for< for this now you can you definitely can for this now you can you definitely can but< but bear in mind that if you were to but bear in mind that if you were to sell< sell the weekly options chances are that sell the weekly options chances are that you< you may not get enough premium to sell you may not get enough premium to sell at< at the strike price that you want so at the strike price that you want so let's< let's say for example the stock may have let's say for example the stock may have dropped< dropped to 90 dropped to 90 and< and if you were to take a look at the and if you were to take a look at the options< options with seven days to expiration options with seven days to expiration you< you might find that the strike price at you might find that the strike price at 75< 75 dollars may not even give you any 75 dollars may not even give you any premium< premium so you can't sell until the premium so you can't sell until the stock< stock drops much further stock drops much further so< so there's a trade-off there while it so there's a trade-off there while it gives< gives a higher gives a higher return< return on your return on your investment investment investment the< the thing is that you may not even get the thing is that you may not even get any< any premium until the stock goes much any premium until the stock goes much lower< lower so meanwhile in between lower so meanwhile in between if< if the price is hovering around 90 if the price is hovering around 90 you< you may you may not< not be selling anything you may just be not be selling anything you may just be sitting< sitting in your hands waiting for the sitting in your hands waiting for the price< price to drop further price to drop further so< so this is the trade-off so generally uh so this is the trade-off so generally uh when< when you do a repair especially when when you do a repair especially when your< your price is quite far away you might your price is quite far away you might want< want to consider doing the days to want to consider doing the days to expiration< expiration with 30 to 45 days left so expiration with 30 to 45 days left so step< step number four is to wait till the step number four is to wait till the desired< desired level is at least more than desired level is at least more than twenty< twenty dollars twenty dollars to< to sell the cash to kill output that's to sell the cash to kill output that's because because because if< if you were to look at the option chain if you were to look at the option chain most< most of the option most of the option uh uh uh premium< premium that you want to get is more premium that you want to get is more than< than 20 deltas this way you get to get than 20 deltas this way you get to get more< more premium anything less than that more premium anything less than that under< under 20 maybe even 10 dollars or five under 20 maybe even 10 dollars or five deltas< deltas you get very little so if you're deltas you get very little so if you're okay< okay with that you definitely can go okay with that you definitely can go ahead< ahead but you're definitely not getting ahead but you're definitely not getting a< a lot so rather than sell a lot so rather than sell you< you know uh the strike price you know uh the strike price at< at five deltas at five deltas i< i would rather wait for the stock to i would rather wait for the stock to drop< drop a little bit more and once it drop a little bit more and once it becomes< becomes 20 delta then i will start to becomes 20 delta then i will start to sell< sell so that means that i might you know sell so that means that i might you know i< i might just have to wait a little bit i might just have to wait a little bit longer< longer the stock might just go back up longer the stock might just go back up and< and if the stock goes up i might have and if the stock goes up i might have missed< missed out on selling the 5 delta for missed out on selling the 5 delta for some< some little premium that is giving on some little premium that is giving on the< the other hand had i sold the the other hand had i sold the 5< 5 delta 5 delta put put put if< if the stock was to continue to drop if the stock was to continue to drop further further further nearer< nearer to my strike price nearer to my strike price it< it would have been a wasted chance for it would have been a wasted chance for me< me because i could have sold it i could me because i could have sold it i could have< have waited a little longer and sold for have waited a little longer and sold for a< a higher premium which can help reduce a higher premium which can help reduce the< the cost basis of my stock even more the cost basis of my stock even more right< right so in general i like to wait until right so in general i like to wait until it's< it's at least more than 20 deltas before it's at least more than 20 deltas before selling< selling the cash output if it's lower selling the cash output if it's lower than< than 20 deltas i would choose to wait than 20 deltas i would choose to wait there< there even times i would like to just there even times i would like to just sell< sell it when it's at the money at 50 sell it when it's at the money at 50 deltas< deltas because that's the most extrinsic deltas because that's the most extrinsic value< value that you can get right when you value that you can get right when you get< get a lot of extrinsic value it can help get a lot of extrinsic value it can help really< really offset really offset the< the cost basis so again this is a the cost basis so again this is a personal< personal preference there's no hard and personal preference there's no hard and fast< fast rule what you should do the main fast rule what you should do the main idea< idea of this cash to cut put is that you idea of this cash to cut put is that you want< want to get feel at the levels the want to get feel at the levels the strikes< strikes that you feel uh that you sold strikes that you feel uh that you sold at< at okay at okay so< so finally step five if it expires so finally step five if it expires worthless< worthless all you have to do is just worthless all you have to do is just rinse< rinse and repeat just like the visual rinse and repeat just like the visual illustration< illustration i showed you earlier just illustration i showed you earlier just keep< keep selling until finally you get the keep selling until finally you get the two< two levels that you one feel two levels that you one feel filled< filled all right all right guys i hope filled all right all right guys i hope this< this has been very helpful for you this this has been very helpful for you this is< is part one uh part two i'll be is part one uh part two i'll be releasing< releasing it again in the next few days releasing it again in the next few days

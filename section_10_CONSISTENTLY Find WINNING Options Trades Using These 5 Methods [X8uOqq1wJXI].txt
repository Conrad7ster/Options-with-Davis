you can see it's actually< actually pretty detailed right they will actually pretty detailed right they will tell< tell you you exactly what this strategy tell you you exactly what this strategy is< is and they even color coded right so is and they even color coded right so green< green is a neutral to bullish strategy green is a neutral to bullish strategy and< and they tell you what kind of strategy and they tell you what kind of strategy it's< it's as well so you can see this is a it's as well so you can see this is a put< put broken wing butterfly put broken wing butterfly and< and they even tell you you know what is and they even tell you you know what is the< the buying power that you need what is the buying power that you need what is the< the credit that you get what is

you you know the how this< this strategy is designed to work right this strategy is designed to work right so< so you can see there is no upside risk so you can see there is no upside risk but< but there is downside risk so this is a but there is downside risk so this is a put< put broken wing butterfly so they even put broken wing butterfly so they even give< give you the downside break even and give you the. downside break even and also< also you know all the Greeks right so also you know all the Greeks right so this< this is you know pretty detailed so you this is you know pretty detailed so you can< can just take these ideas and then just can just take these ideas and then just evaluate< evaluate for yourself right you do not evaluate for yourself right you do not have< have to definitely put on every single have to definitely put on every single trick< trick that they give you right trick that they give you right so< so you can see down here they also give so you can see down here they also give neutral< neutral strategy so I think that each neutral strategy so I think that each newsletter< newsletter which they send you or rather newsletter which they send you or rather an< an email which they send you they will an email which they send you they will have< have a bullish trade idea a neutral have a bullish trade idea a neutral trade< trade idea as well as a bearish trade trade idea as well as a bearish trade idea< idea so this way you know you have a idea so this way you know you have a mixture< mixture of different strategies to put mixture of different strategies to put on< on so from here you can see this is a on so from here you can see this is a neutral< neutral strategy now you can see this is neutral strategy now you can see this is a< a short strangle now short strangle is a short strangle now short strangle is an< an undefined risk strategy that means an undefined risk strategy that means theoretically< theoretically there's you know unlimited theoretically there's you know unlimited losses< losses to the upside and you know the losses to the upside and you know the stock< stock can crash all the way to zero on stock can crash all the way to zero on the< the downside so if you're not the downside so if you're not comfortable< comfortable with this kind of trade you comfortable with this kind of trade you can< can actually just change it to an iron can actually just change it to an iron Condor< Condor right iron Condor you just buy Condor right iron Condor you just buy the< the wings you buy a long put and you buy the wings you buy a long put and you buy a< a long call pass your short strikes and a long call pass your short strikes and that< that will give you a defined risk that will give you a defined risk strategy< strategy so you can see down here they strategy so you can see down here they give< give you the buying power of 950 now if give you the buying power of 950 now if you< you have a smaller account you can you have a smaller account you can definitely< definitely change the parameters right definitely change the parameters right you< you don't have to just stick to the you don't have to just stick to the parameters< parameters which they give you like for parameters which they give you like for example< example for down here they give you a 70 example for down here they give you a 70 put< put and 85 call now if you're a little put and 85 call now if you're a little bit< bit more conservative you might want to bit more conservative you might want to widen< widen these strikes out a little bit widen these strikes out a little bit right< right maybe you might want to go for the right maybe you might want to go for the 68< 68 put or maybe the 87 call and then 68 put or maybe the 87 call and then from< from there you can kind of just adjust from there you can kind of just adjust and< and see what kind of credit you can get and see what kind of credit you can get right< right so for down here you can see it right so for down here you can see it gives< gives you 3. 55 so if you want it to be gives you 3.

55 so if you want it to be you< you know more conservative you can open you know more conservative you can open up< up this uh strangle or you can just go up this uh strangle or you can just go for< for the iron Condor right iron Condor for the iron Condor right iron Condor you'll< you'll just buy a put and a call you you'll just buy a put and a call you know< know pass this strike so if they give know pass this strike so if they give you< you 70 put and if you say you know you you 70 put and if you say you know you want< want a five point white iron Condor then want a five point white iron Condor then you'll< you'll be buying the 65 put and you'll you'll be buying the 65 put and you'll be< be buying the 90 call option so this way be buying the 90 call option so this way it< it becomes a 5 point wide iron Condor it becomes a 5 point wide iron Condor where< where your maximum risk is 500 which is where your maximum risk is 500 which is the< the width of spread minus the premium the width of spread minus the premium which< which you receive right so this is for which you receive right so this is for the< the neutral trade and they also have one the neutral trade and they also have one for< for the bearish trade so as you can see for the bearish trade so as you can see it's< it's pretty Diversified right you put it's pretty Diversified right you put one< one bullish you put one neutral you put one bullish you put one neutral you put one< one bearish so this way you know if the one bearish so this way you know if the market< market happens to move in tandem right market happens to move in tandem right if< if it goes all the way up in tandem or if it goes all the way up in tandem or goes< goes down in tandem at least you know goes down in tandem at least you know you< you have them hedging each other rather you have them hedging each other rather than< than all exposed to Just One Direction than all exposed to Just One Direction okay< okay so

strategies seeing all these ideas of the strategies you< you know sometimes what you can do is you know sometimes what you can do is just< just see what kind of stocks they're just see what kind of stocks they're trading< trading right so I do go inside here trading right so I do go inside here from< from time. to time just to see what kind from time to time just to see what kind of< of stocks

follow exactly what< what they do right if you choose to you what they do right if you choose to you can< can as well okay so let's go to the can as well okay so let's go to the Third< Third Way and the Third Way is using Third Way and the Third Way is using scanners< scanners right so scanners there are scanners right so scanners there are many< many in the market right if you do a many in the market right if you do a search< search for option scanner on Google you search for option scanner on Google you should< should see quite a number of them so for should see quite a number of them so for this< this this is the TD Ameritrade hacker so this this is the TD Ameritrade hacker so if< if you have a demo account or if you if you have a demo account or if you have< have Live account you can just go ahead have Live account you can just go ahead to< to go to the tab down here you can see to go to the tab down here you can see it< it says scan and then you have two it says scan and then you have two options< options you have the option hacker and options you have the option hacker and the< the spread hacker now I do not use this the spread hacker now I do not use this personally< personally but I've got people who have personally but I've got people who have reached< reached out to me telling me that they reached out to me telling me that they have< have been using it to find some trade have been using it to find some trade idea< idea so this is where you know you could idea so this is where you know you could use< use this if you are stuck for ideas use this if you are stuck for ideas right< right if you want to put on certain right if you want to put on certain trades< trades you're not sure what to do you trades you're not sure what to do you can< can actually use this scanner to find can actually use this scanner to find you< you know certain criterias that you're you know certain criterias that you're looking< looking for right let's say for example looking for right let's say for example but< but you want to put on a credit spread but you want to put on a credit spread so< so down here you can search for vertical so down here you can search for vertical and< and as for the stocks down here you can and as for the stocks down here you can actually< actually just go for spreads inside the actually just go for spreads inside the S< S P 500 so they will give you you know S P 500 so they will give you you know the< the 500 stocks in SMP to choose from or the 500 stocks in SMP to choose from or whatever< whatever filters that you want right whatever filters that you want right there< there are quite a number of filters there are quite a number of filters right< right so there are quite a number of right so there are quite a number of choices< choices you can choose from this drop choices you can choose from this drop down< down box if you click down here and down box if you click down here and there< there is like you know the 52 weeks High there is like you know the 52 weeks High 52< 52 weeks low the top volatility and so 52 weeks low the top volatility and so on< on and so forth right so quite a number on and so forth right so quite a number of< of things to choose from then next you of things to choose from then next you can< can filter by the underlying price right can filter by the underlying price right you< you can also filter by probability of you can also filter by probability of profit< profit so let's say for example you want profit so let's say for example you want to< to put on a credit spread that has only to put on a credit spread that has only 70< 70 percent of win rate so 70 to 75 this 70 percent of win rate so 70 to 75 this range< range then they will give you you know a range then they will give you you know a bunch< bunch of this which is roughly around 30 bunch of this which is roughly around 30 to< to 25 Delta on the short strike right to 25 Delta on the short strike right and< and then you also have the volatility so and then you also have the volatility so from< from here it says front volatility so from here it says front volatility so sometimes< sometimes when you put on a calendar sometimes when you put on a calendar spread< spread the differentiate between the spread the differentiate between the front< front volatility and the back volatility front volatility and the back volatility same< same as the diagonal spread as well but same as the diagonal spread as well but if< if you put on the vertical spread then if you put on the vertical spread then it's< it's all going to be the same volatility it's all going to be the same volatility because< because you're having two legs on the because you're having two legs on the same< same DTE right so this doesn't matter so same DTE right so this doesn't matter so for< for here if you want you know it depends for here if you want you know it depends on< on what kind of volatility you want some on what kind of volatility you want some people< people love very high volatility so it's people love very high volatility so it's really< really up to you to decide what you want really up to you to decide what you want right< right the 30 I think is the default down right the 30 I think is the default down here< here so I just put it as that and then here so I just put it as that and then you< you want to choose the days to you want to choose the days to expiration< expiration right so if you are like me expiration right so if you are like me you< you like to stick somewhere around the you like to stick somewhere around the 45< 45 days range you can put anywhere from 45 days range you can put anywhere from 40< 40 to 60. if you're someone to like to 40 to 60.

if you're someone to like to trade< trade you know show the time frame then trade you know show the time frame then you< you could change this to I don't know you could change this to I don't know maybe< maybe weekly zero DT whatever rocks your maybe weekly zero DT whatever rocks your boat< boat right this is just the fine trade boat right this is just the fine trade ideas< ideas then you can see down here they ideas then you can see down here they will< will populate a bunch of ideas down here will populate a bunch of ideas down here so< so what you want to do is just go so what you want to do is just go through< through each of them and of course you through each of them and of course you do< do not want to put a trade on on each do not want to put a trade on on each one< one of them because there'll be so many one of them because there'll be so many for< for you to choose from you just want to for you to choose from you just want to filter< filter out and see you know which one is filter out and see you know which one is suitable< suitable. for you which one you like then suitable for you which one you like then you< you put them on all right so this is the you put them on all right so this is the third< third way for you to find winning option third way for you to find winning option trade< trade ideas now the fourth way by the trade ideas now the fourth way by the way< way if you like this video so far Please way if you like this video so far Please Subscribe< Subscribe and also click the thumbs up Subscribe and also click the thumbs up button< button and also do get your free copy of button and also do get your free copy of the< the options income blueprint where I the options income blueprint where I share< share the top three options strategies share the top three options strategies that< that help you generate a consistent that help you generate a consistent income< income each month trading just one to income each month trading just one to two< two hours a day right so if you want to two hours a day right so if you want to go< go ahead to get this copy just head on go ahead to get this copy just head on over< over to optionswithdavis. com blueprint over to optionswithdavis.

com blueprint or< or right back to the video now the or right back to the video now the fourth< fourth way is to use indicators and fourth way is to use indicators and technical< technical analysis right so I'm just technical analysis right so I'm just going< going to share with you the basic one going to share with you the basic one that< that you could use right so the basic that you could use right so the basic one< one is basically something like using an one is basically something like using an oversold< oversold or overbought indicator like oversold or overbought indicator like the< the stochastics and then just use very the stochastics and then just use very simple< simple ta like support and resistance simple ta like support and resistance levels< levels right don't have to go into all levels right don't have to go into all those< those triangles bull flag and all that those triangles bull flag and all that you< you know mumbo jumbo stuff right just you know mumbo jumbo stuff right just stick< stick with the very simple stuff which stick with the very simple stuff which is< is you know pretty effective by itself is you know pretty effective by itself already< already right so let's say for example already right so let's say for example you< you have already a watch list of stocks you have already a watch list of stocks right< right you can scan through each of them right you can scan through each of them and< and then just find to see whether and then just find to see whether there's< there's you know overbought or oversold there's you know overbought or oversold right< right by the way if you're curious about right by the way if you're curious about you< you know what kind of uh this uh you know what kind of uh this uh stochastic< stochastic settings that I have I stochastic settings that I have I actually< actually have a video on that already actually have a video on that already just< just go to my channel and search for just go to my channel and search for that< that all right but the settings isn't that all right but the settings isn't really< really that important because most of really that important because most of them< them will pretty much show the same them will pretty much show the same thing< thing right so for this you can see what thing right so for this you can see what I'm< I'm looking for right just find I'm looking for right just find something< something that is oversold and then something that is oversold and then there< there is a support down here you can see there is a support down here you can see this< this uh Gold Line down here and then this uh Gold Line down here and then from< from here you can see this oversold from here you can see this oversold there's< there's a support line so what you could there's a support line so what you could do< do an idea is to put a bull put spread do an idea is to put a bull put spread on< on right so the blue put spread we put on right so the blue put spread we put below< below the support as well as you know below the support as well as you know since< since it's oversold then there is you since it's oversold then there is you know< know a higher probability that the know a higher probability that the market< market could go up than it continue market could go up than it continue going< going down now of course there's always going down now of course there's always a< a chance that the market could go down a chance that the market could go down again< again we're playing with probability again we're playing with probability here< here we won't win every single trade of here we won't win every single trade of course< course right it's not a hundred percent course right it's not a hundred percent win< win rate there's still a chance for you win rate there's still a chance for you to< to lose as well as losing streaks so you to lose as well as losing streaks so you have< have to take account for that now on the have to take account for that now on the other< other hand you could also look for other hand you could also look for stocks< stocks that are overbought right stocks that are overbought right overbought< overbought and then there is resistance overbought and then there is resistance so< so you can see down here the price came so you can see down here the price came to< to this point and then it went down so to this point and then it went down so we< we can put this Gold Line down here as we can put this Gold Line down here as you< you know a previous resistance level so you know a previous resistance level so from< from here you could choose to put on a from here you could choose to put on a bear< bear called spread also known as a call bear called spread also known as a call Credit< Credit spread so again you know although Credit spread so again you know although it's< it's overbought the market could still it's overbought the market could still continue< continue going up again but probability continue going up again but probability again< again right so we're just playing a again right so we're just playing a probability< probability we want to put as much you probability we want to put as much you know< know odds in our favor so that in the know odds in our favor so that in the long< long term we will come out on top right long term we will come out on top right we< we will come out profitable so this is we will come out profitable so this is the< the idea they can use using you know the idea they can use using you know indicators< indicators and technical analysis now indicators and technical analysis now the< the fifth and final way is my the fifth and final way is my proprietary< proprietary income grid option trading proprietary income grid option trading methodology< methodology so this is how I actually methodology so this is how I actually enter< enter into trades and I've already enter into trades and I've already created< created a video all about this so if created a video all about this so if you're< you're curious you know you can just go you're curious you know you can just go ahead< ahead to find it on my channel I'll ahead to find it on my channel I'll actually< actually put the link at the top right actually put the link at the top right hand< hand corner of this video so you can go hand corner of this video so you can go ahead< ahead and watch that if you haven't ahead and watch that if you haven't already< already watched that. right so basically already watched that right so basically the< the way I do it is I like to draw these the way I do it is I like to draw these lines< lines right down here on the chart so lines right down here on the chart so basically< basically you know these lines are where basically you know these lines are where I< I can find Opportunities so I call this I can find Opportunities so I call this income< income grid levels right so at each of income grid levels right so at each of this< this income grid level you have four this income grid level you have four choices< choices right you could choose to place choices right you could choose to place a< a bullish strategy or you could choose a bullish strategy or you could choose to< to place a bearish strategy or you could to place a bearish strategy or you could choose< choose to place a neutral strategy or choose to place a neutral strategy or you< you could simply do nothing right you could simply do nothing right there's< there's no need for you to enter into a there's no need for you to enter into a trade< trade if you don't want to so the reason trade if you don't want to so the reason why< why I like to do it this way is because why I like to do it this way is because I< I prefer vertical diversification over I prefer vertical diversification over horizontal< horizontal diversification so horizontal horizontal diversification so horizontal diversification< diversification is where you have diversification is where you have multiple< multiple stocks right you go through multiple stocks right you go through maybe< maybe 10 20 stocks and then for each of maybe 10 20 stocks and then for each of them< them you place on a trade now there's them you place on a trade now there's certainly< certainly nothing wrong with that but I certainly nothing wrong with that but I prefer< prefer the vertical way because you know prefer the vertical way because you know when< when the market moves sometimes when when the market moves sometimes when there's< there's a crash or when the market there's a crash or when the market relies< relies it tends to move in tandem so if relies it tends to move in tandem so if you< you have like 10 trades all together you have like 10 trades all together right< right let's say for example you have one right let's say for example you have one stock< stock down here two stock down here stock down here two stock down here three< three stock and so on so forth all of three stock and so on so forth all of them< them have the same kind of trades on them have the same kind of trades on what< what happens is that you know when the what happens is that you know when the market< market crashes they're all going to go market crashes they're all going to go down< down at the same time so you're going to down at the same time so you're going to all< all get hit at the same point but with all get hit at the same point but with vertical< vertical diversification you know vertical diversification you know because< because you have trades at different because you have trades at different areas< areas right at different places then you areas right at different places then you know< know your p l is going to be much more know your p l is going to be much more smoother< smoother and that is why for this smoother and that is why for this strategy< strategy I like to do it on the index strategy I like to do it on the index ETFs< ETFs as opposed to individual stocks ETFs as opposed to individual stocks because< because individual stocks right research because individual stocks right research have< have already shown that it is much more have already shown that it is much more volatile< volatile right the movements are going volatile right the movements are going to< to be much more bigger compared to index to be much more bigger compared to index ETFs< ETFs index ETFs right it won't be ETFs index ETFs right it won't be subjected< subjected to individual stock earnings subjected to individual stock earnings because< because it's a basket of stock so any because it's a basket of stock so any stock< stock that is releasing earnings that is stock that is releasing earnings that is inside< inside the index ETF is not going to inside the index ETF is not going to have< have such a big impact compared to have such a big impact compared to individual< individual stocks so when I do it on the individual stocks so when I do it on the index< index ETFs I find that you know the index ETFs I find that you know the profits< profits is much more consistent as well profits is much more consistent as well as< as the smoothness of your p l right so as the smoothness of your p l right so the< the variance is not going to be so wide the variance is not going to be so wide whereby< whereby you know the p l swing is so whereby you know the p l swing is so large< large but one day it's going to go up a large but one day it's going to go up a lot< lot and the next day is going to go down lot and the next day is going to go down because< because this has already vertical because this has already vertical diversification< diversification already built into this diversification already built into this all< all right guys so if you are stuck right all right guys so if you are stuck right unsure< unsure what kind of option trades to put unsure what kind of option trades to put on< on then you can use this five secret on then you can use this five

==================================================================

Language: en all< all right Al righty so in today's video all right Al righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you a very I'm going to be sharing with you a very interesting< interesting strategy and I'm pretty sure interesting strategy and I'm pretty sure that< that this is a strategy that you do want that this is a strategy that you do want to< to implement and one that you'll be very to implement and one that you'll be very interested< interested in why well it's because this interested in why well it's because this strategy< strategy is 100% risk free there is strategy is 100% risk free there is absolutely< absolutely no risk in this strategy and absolutely no risk in this strategy and this< this is not a scam right this is a 100% this is not a scam right this is a 100% legit< legit strategy that you can actually put legit strategy that you can actually put on< on that takes away all all the risk that on that takes away all all the risk that you< you have which means to say there is no you have which means to say there is no Capital< Capital risk at all for this option Capital risk at all for this option strategy< strategy right so what is this 100% strategy right so what is this 100% risk-free< risk-free strategy and in the first risk-free strategy and in the first place< place is it really even possible well place is it really even possible well let's< let's find out together so what is this let's find out together so what is this strategy< strategy this strategy is none other strategy this strategy is none other than< than the 100% risk-free butterfly right than the 100% risk-free butterfly right so< so if you guys are familiar with the so if you guys are familiar with the butterfly< butterfly I'm sure you know that the butterfly I'm sure you know that the butterfly< butterfly do have some risk although the butterfly do have some risk although the risk< risk reward is you know pretty good good risk reward is you know pretty good good right< right but you still have some risk so right but you still have some risk so you< you might be wondering how is it you might be wondering how is it possible< possible to have a 100% risk free possible to have a 100% risk free butterfly< butterfly right so for this strategy I butterfly right so for this strategy I have< have some good news and some bad news have some good news and some bad news right< right so the good news is that this can right so the good news is that this can definitely< definitely be done right so it's 100% definitely be done right so it's 100% legit< legit 100% risk- free if you can put it legit 100% risk- free if you can put it on< on then you have eliminated all risk on then you have eliminated all risk from< from the trade right but the bad news is from the trade right but the bad news is that< that there is a condition that has to be that there is a condition that has to be met< met in order for you to be able to met in order for you to be able to construct< construct the 100% risk-free butterfly construct the 100% risk-free butterfly right< right so it's a little bit like you have right so it's a little bit like you have to< to nurture it so just imagine this right to nurture it so just imagine this right when< when you first start it off it has to be when you first start it off it has to be like< like a caterpillar right so in case like a caterpillar right so in case you're< you're not sure what I'm doing right now you're not sure what I'm doing right now I'm< I'm actually drawing a caterpillar I'm actually drawing a caterpillar definitely< definitely doesn't look at it right now definitely doesn't look at it right now but< but iure you it is a caterpillar as long but iure you it is a caterpillar as long as< as my GD one you know artistic skills as my GD one you know artistic skills actually< actually show so this is a caterpillar actually show so this is a caterpillar right< right caterpillar with eyes no it's it's right caterpillar with eyes no it's it's not< not a center pit it is a caterpillar so not a center pit it is a caterpillar so it< it starts off as something like a it starts off as something like a caterpillar< caterpillar and in order for it to caterpillar and in order for it to become< become a 100% rree butterfly certain become a 100% rree butterfly certain conditions< conditions have to be met then it will conditions have to be met then it will become< become a become a beautiful< beautiful risk-free 100% risk beautiful risk-free 100% risk free< free butterfly so this is a butterfly free butterfly so this is a butterfly and< and and wow I'm I'm pretty impressed and and wow I'm I'm pretty impressed with< with my butterfly right it looks pretty with my butterfly right it looks pretty good< good right definitely much better than good right definitely much better than the< the caterpillar so how do you know this the caterpillar so how do you know this is< is a 100% risk free butterfly well you is a 100% risk free butterfly well you have< have to look at the wings right you need have to look at the wings right you need to< to see whether the wings actually say to see whether the wings actually say 100%< 100% risk free 100% risk free butterfly< butterfly right so if you see a butterfly right so if you see a butterfly< butterfly in your garden right and it butterfly in your garden right and it flies< flies by and you see that on its wings flies by and you see that on its wings it< it has 100% risk-free butterfly rden on it has 100% risk-free butterfly rden on it< it catch it right because this is how it catch it right because this is how you< you actually construct the 100% risk you actually construct the 100% risk free< free butterfly all right so enough free butterfly all right so enough nonsense< nonsense so how do you create a 100% nonsense so how do you create a 100% risk-free< risk-free butterfly so the thing is that risk-free butterfly so the thing is that for< for you to get into this construct where for you to get into this construct where there's< there's absolutely no risk for the there's absolutely no risk for the butterfly< butterfly it doesn't actually start off butterfly it doesn't actually start off as< as a butterfly right so remember I as a butterfly right so remember I shared< shared you the picture it starts off as shared you the picture it starts off as a< a caterpillar so what is this a caterpillar so what is this caterpillar< caterpillar well this caterpillar is caterpillar well this caterpillar is basically< basically the put ratio spread so you basically the put ratio spread so you have< have to put on a put ratio spread first have to put on a put ratio spread first where< where going to be some risk obviously where going to be some risk obviously right< right because the put ratio spread is right because the put ratio spread is not< not a risk-free strategy right so you not a risk-free strategy right so you have< have to start off with a put ratio have to start off with a put ratio spread< spread and if you're not familiar what spread and if you're not familiar what the< the put ratio spread is it's basically the put ratio spread is it's basically just< just two short puts that is very far out just two short puts that is very far out of< of money and one nearer you know long of money and one nearer you know long put< put option right slightly closer to put option right slightly closer to where< where the market is right so again if where the market is right so again if you< you want to think of it in a much easier you want to think of it in a much easier way< way is pretty much a short putut right way is pretty much a short putut right imagine< imagine this two short putut you split imagine this two short putut you split up< up it's pretty much just a short putut up it's pretty much just a short putut that< that is financing a put debit spread so that is financing a put debit spread so you< you have one uh long put and one short you have one uh long put and one short putut< putut so down here this is the put debit putut so down here this is the put debit spread< spread right so this is the put ratio spread right so this is the put ratio spread< spread you have to start off as a put spread you have to start off as a put ratio< ratio spread first so as an example ratio spread first so as an example let's< let's say you sold the 1 19195 put ratio let's say you sold the 1 19195 put ratio spread< spread for spread for $844< $844 credit right so this is the first $844 credit right so this is the first step< step now the second step is that you step now the second step is that you want< want to select the further out of the want to select the further out of the money< money put that is equidistant from the money put that is equidistant from the other< other long putut so what you're trying other long putut so what you're trying to< to do here is now you're trying to to do here is now you're trying to convert< convert it into the butterfly right so convert it into the butterfly right so remember< remember the butterfly is nothing more remember the butterfly is nothing more than< than the defined risk version of the put than the defined risk version of the put ratio< ratio spread now in order to converted ratio spread now in order to converted into< into this uh risk-free butterfly then into this uh risk-free butterfly then you< you need to select the out ofth money you need to select the out ofth money long< long putut that is equidistance from the long putut that is equidistance from the other< other long putut and this is very other long putut and this is very important< important so what do I mean by important so what do I mean by equidistance< equidistance so for example this is the equidistance so for example this is the distance< distance or rather the spread of the put distance or rather the spread of the put ratio< ratio spread that you put on right as ratio spread that you put on right as you< you can see it's Five Points wide from 1 you can see it's Five Points wide from 1 190< 190 to5 so for you to get an 190 to5 so for you to get an equidistance< equidistance strike then on the other equidistance strike then on the other side< side you also need it to be five points side you also need it to be five points wide< wide so 1 90 minus 5 that is 185 so what wide so 1 90 minus 5 that is 185 so what you're< you're doing is that you are capping the you're doing is that you are capping the risk< risk all the way to the downside so to risk all the way to the downside so to speak< speak right basically you are. um turning speak right basically you are um turning it< it into a butterfly with this long put it into a butterfly with this long put now< now why is it important to make it now why is it important to make it equidistant< equidistant right it's important to make equidistant right it's important to make it< it equidistant because if you were to it equidistant because if you were to choose< choose the 184 strike let's say you choose the 184 strike let's say you choose< choose the one that is six points away choose the one that is six points away now< now it's no longer 100% risk free now it's no longer 100% risk free because< because now you're going to get some because now you're going to get some risk< risk remember the whole structure of risk remember the whole structure of this< this butterfly the profit is basically this butterfly the profit is basically what< what you get down here right the profit what you get down here right the profit is< is based off this debit spread that you is based off this debit spread that you have< have right it's the embedded debit have right it's the embedded debit spread< spread of this whole structure and then spread of this whole structure and then the< the max loss down here is basically also the max loss down here is basically also the< the uh width of this spread that you the uh width of this spread that you have< have on the downside so basically what have on the downside so basically what you< you have down here this is the credit you have down here this is the credit spread< spread this is the debit spread so the spread this is the debit spread so the max< max profit of debit spread is going to max profit of debit spread is going to be< be $500 because it's 5 Points so if it's be $500 because it's 5 Points so if it's equidistance< equidistance then the max loss is going equidistance then the max loss is going to< to be $500 as well so anything past 18 to be $500 as well so anything past 18 185< 185 there's no risk but if you choose 185 there's no risk but if you choose 184< 184 now suddenly you have a 6o wide 184 now suddenly you have a 6o wide credit< credit spread on the downside and what credit spread on the downside and what the< the means is that your max profit from the means is that your max profit from your< your debit spread which is only $500 your debit spread which is only $500 cannot< cannot cover the max loss of the six cannot cover the max loss of the six points< points which is $600 right which means points which is $600 right which means to< to say there is going to be a risk of to say there is going to be a risk of about< about $100 on the downside so if you about $100 on the downside so if you want< want to crft one that has 100% risk- want to crft one that has 100% risk- free< free then you definitely want to choose free then you definitely want to choose an< an equidistance strike basically the an equidistance strike basically the same< same width as the embedded debit spread same width as the embedded debit spread of< of your initial put ratio spread next of your initial put ratio spread next step< step step number three also a very step step number three also a very important< important one and that is to place a important one and that is to place a limit< limit order to buy that put option for limit order to buy that put option for less< less than the credit that you receive so less than the credit that you receive so here's< here's an example so you place a limit here's an example so you place a limit order< order to buy the 185 put for a140 or order to buy the 185 put for a140 or less< less so very important right so you want less so very important right so you want to< to make sure that when you are placing to make sure that when you are placing the< the limit order you're buying it for the limit order you're buying it for less< less than the credit that you receive less than the credit that you receive because< because if you were to put it more than because if you were to put it more than the< the credit that you receive then it's no the credit that you receive then it's no longer< longer going to be a 100% risk-free longer going to be a 100% risk-free butterfly< butterfly right there's going to be some butterfly right there's going to be some risks< risks right it's just like you you know risks right it's just like you you know for< for example your wife asks you to go for example your wife asks you to go down< down to the convenience store or the down to the convenience store or the grocery< grocery store to ask you to buy grocery store to ask you to buy something< something and she tells you that you something and she tells you that you know< know her budget is $50 see whether you know her budget is $50 see whether you can< can get it for less than that but can get it for less than that but instead< instead you go to the grocery store and instead you go to the grocery store and instead< instead of just using the budget of $50 instead of just using the budget of $50 you< you see so many other things that you you see so many other things that you want< want to buy and you end up buying a want to buy and you end up buying a total< total of over hundred over dollars right total of over hundred over dollars right so< so you go back to your wife and you tell so you go back to your wife and you tell your< your wife that you know instead of your wife that you know instead of spending< spending that $50 you spent over $100 spending that $50 you spent over $100 and< and that is when your wife and that is when your wife is< is going to do to you what most options is going to do to you what most options generally< generally do and that is to make you generally do and that is to make you expire< expire worthless right so if you do not expire worthless right so if you do not want< want your wife to make you expire want your wife to make you expire worthless< worthless then guess what you need to be worthless then guess what you need to be a< a man do the right thing make sure that a man do the right thing make sure that you< you spend within the budget that she you spend within the budget that she gave< gave you and in fact if you buy much gave you and in fact if you buy much lesser< lesser than the budget she gave you lesser than the budget she gave you she's< she's going to be so happy that not only she's going to be so happy that not only is< is she not going to make you expire is she not going to make you expire worthless< worthless she's probably going to R you worthless she's probably going to R you to< to the next expiration date right so to the next expiration date right so she's< she's going to keep you around for much she's going to keep you around for much longer< longer and keep rolling you and the best longer and keep rolling you and the best thing< thing you know that you know you've made thing you know that you know you've made it< it right is when your wife has actually it right is when your wife has actually rolled< rolled you into a rolled you into a leap< leap so if she rolled you to a leap then leap so if she rolled you to a leap then you< you have you know one to two years of you have you know one to two years of free< free time basically right and basically free time basically right and basically you< you can do whatever you want until the you can do whatever you want until the time< time comes where you're going to expire time comes where you're going to expire worthless< worthless again you better be sharp and worthless again you better be sharp and not< not do anything to anger your wife all not do anything to anger your wife all right< right so basically the point here is right so basically the point here is that< that do not you know pay more than that do not you know pay more than whatever< whatever the credit that you receive whatever the credit that you receive down< down here okay so if you want it to be down here okay so if you want it to be 100%< 100% risk- free just make sure that 100% risk- free just make sure that whatever< whatever you're buying that long put for whatever you're buying that long put for is< is less than the credit that you receive is less than the credit that you receive for< for the put ratio spread now the final for the put ratio spread now the final step< step step number four basically you've step step number four basically you've already< already done all the work right you sold already done all the work right you sold the< the put ratio spread you've already the put ratio spread you've already selected< selected the equidistant long put and selected the equidistant long put and then< then you place a limit order that is then you place a limit order that is less< less than the credit that you sold it less than the credit that you sold it for< for ensuring that it's going to be risk- for ensuring that it's going to be risk- free< free now all that's left is to pretty free now all that's left is to pretty much< much just wait until you get fill right much just wait until you get fill right so< so if you get filled then so if you get filled then congratulations< congratulations this is where you now congratulations this is where you now have< have a 100% risk-free butterfly right so have a 100% risk-free butterfly right so I'm< I'm going to give you an actual example I'm going to give you an actual example to< to show you one of my trads that I to show you one of my trads that I converted< converted it from a put ratio spread to converted it from a put ratio spread to a< a 100% risk-free Butterfly by the way if a 100% risk-free

com blueprint all< all right back to the video right so as all right back to the video right so as you< you can see down here this is a put you can see down here this is a put ratio< ratio spread that I put on so I sold the ratio spread that I put on so I sold the 1831< 1831 189 put ratio spread for a credit 1831 189 put ratio spread for a credit of< of 32 cents right so I'm going to of 32 cents right so I'm going to receive< receive $32 in terms of Premium upfront receive $32 in terms of Premium upfront so< so so as you can see down here this is so so as you can see down here this is the< the structure of the put ratio spread so the structure of the put ratio spread so again< again this is where the short put is at again this is where the short put is at the< the two puts down here and then the long the two puts down here and then the long put< put is over here right you have the one put is over here right you have the one long< long put and this is where the. current long put and this is where the current market< market price is so as you can see market price is so as you can see whenever< whenever we are putting on the put ratio whenever we are putting on the put ratio spread< spread we want the put ratio spread spread we want the put ratio spread structure< structure generally I like it to be structure generally I like it to be below< below where the current market price is below where the current market price is basically< basically this T down here from this basically this T down here from this point< point to here I want this T to be below point to here I want this T to be below where< where the current market price is now where the current market price is now the< the next step as you know is to identify the next step as you know is to identify where< where this equidistant long put is right where this equidistant long put is right so< so as you can see down here the put so as you can see down here the put ratio< ratio spread that I have on is ratio spread that I have on is 18389< 18389 so that is 6. y so where do you 18389 so that is 6.

y so where do you think< think that equidistant long putut is think that equidistant long putut is going< going to be it's going to be 6 point going to be it's going to be 6 point away< away from where this short strike is so away from where this short strike is so this< this short strike down here is 183 so this short strike down here is 183 so I'm< I'm looking for one that is six points I'm looking for one that is six points away< away right six points away so what is 6 away right six points away so what is 6 points< points away from 183 the answer is points away from 183 the answer is 177< 177 right so I need to choose the 177 177 right so I need to choose the 177 strike< strike the long put over there to pretty strike the long put over there to pretty much< much just build this 100% risk-free much just build this 100% risk-free butterfly< butterfly so after some time the butterfly so after some time the equidistant< equidistant long put at 177 which is 6 equidistant long put at 177 which is 6 points< points away from the shot put as I points away from the shot put as I mentioned< mentioned is now marking at 25 cents so mentioned is now marking at 25 cents so at< at this point let me ask you this at this point let me ask you this question< question does it look like we can put question does it look like we can put this< this on for a 100% risk-free butterfly this on for a 100% risk-free butterfly well< well the answer is yes because now I'm well the answer is yes because now I'm buying< buying that put option which is lesser buying that put option which is lesser than< than the credit that I received up front than the credit that I received up front right< right so as you can see down here right right so as you can see down here right now< now I am able to construct this uh put now I am able to construct this uh put ratio< ratio spread turn it into a 100% ratio spread turn it into a 100% risk-free< risk-free butterfly right so that's risk-free butterfly right so that's exactly< exactly what I did so I bought it and I exactly what I did so I bought it and I got< got fill b 1 cent better so basically I got fill b 1 cent better so basically I bought< bought it at 24 cents as you can see bought it at 24 cents as you can see down< down here so what does this mean it down here so what does this mean it means< means right now I pretty much have the means right now I pretty much have the 100%< 100% risk-free butterfly put on and in 100% risk-free butterfly put on and in fact< fact you notice that there's absolutely fact you notice that there's absolutely no< no risk whatsoever on both sides right no risk whatsoever on both sides right you< you can see down here this is the0 pnl you can see down here this is the0 pnl level< level you can see that the line down level you can see that the line down here< here is actually above zero right so we here is actually above zero right so we have< have two points down here this point and have two points down here this point and this< this point down here which means to say this point down here which means to say that< that if if the market settles anywhere that if if the market settles anywhere past< past this point or below this point down past this point or below this point down here< here then I'm just going to get the here then I'm just going to get the minimum< minimum profit so what is the minimum minimum profit so what is the minimum profit< profit the minimum profit is basically profit the minimum profit is basically the< the difference from the credit that you the difference from the credit that you receive< receive upfront and what you purchase receive upfront and what you purchase the< the long put for so if my Ms didn't fill the long put for so if my Ms didn't fill me< me then you can see that the difference me then you can see that the difference is< is 8 cents which means to say there is a is 8 cents which means to say there is a minimum< minimum profit of $8 right if it goes minimum profit of $8 right if it goes past< past this point down here or it goes past this point down here or it goes past< past this point over here so as you can past this point over here so as you can see< see not only do I have no risk on the see not only do I have no risk on the structure< structure I actually have a minimum structure I actually have a minimum profit< profit and the best thing is that if the profit and the best thing is that if the market< market actually trades down to somewhere market actually trades down to somewhere inside< inside this 10 at expiration okay so inside this 10 at expiration okay so basically< basically this is where the current basically this is where the current market< market price is if you cannot see all market price is if you cannot see all right< right this is where the market price is right this is where the market price is now< now if the market trades down and it now if the market trades down and it lands< lands somewhere around here at lands somewhere around here at expiration< expiration then this is where I'm going expiration then this is where I'm going to< to get much more than the minimum profit to get much more than the minimum profit and< and if it doesn't reach inside here then and if it doesn't reach inside here then guess< guess what at least I still get some guess what at least I still get some profit< profit so by buying the equidistant long profit so by buying the equidistant long put< put I now have 100% zero risk right now put I now have 100% zero risk right now it< it is 100% risk free I have a minimum it is 100% risk free I have a minimum guaranteed< guaranteed profit as well as I mentioned guaranteed profit as well as I mentioned because< because that's the difference between because that's the difference between the< the credit you receive up front and what the credit you receive up front and what you< you bought that long put for and now you you bought that long put for and now you have< have your buying power reinstated right have your buying power reinstated right your< your buying power requirement is no your buying power requirement is no longer< longer used for this trade because you longer used for this trade because you have< have pretty much turn it into a have pretty much turn it into a risk-free< risk-free so whatever that was stuck risk-free so whatever that was stuck previously< previously for putting on this trade has previously for putting on this trade has now< now been released and now you can put on now been released and now you can put on another< another trade that you want to and this another trade that you want to and this structure< structure is still on right this structure is still on right this structure< structure is still there for you for the structure is still there for you for the possibility< possibility that the market can trade possibility that the market can trade inside< inside here and you can make much more inside here and you can make much more than< than the minimum profit so imagine this than the minimum profit so imagine this imagine< imagine where you have reached the point imagine where you have reached the point where< where you have put on so many of. this where you have put on so many of this 100%< 100% risk-free butterfly that you know 100% risk-free butterfly that you know as< as long as the market trades to any one as long as the market trades to any one of< of those butterflies it's going to have of those butterflies it's going to have a< a chance for you you know to make the a chance for you you know to make the profits< profits that is somewhere inside this profits that is somewhere inside this tent< tent now at this point you might have a tent now at this point you might have a question< question or maybe you might not but I question or maybe you might not but I want< want to bring this question to your want to bring this question to your attention< attention is you know what is the cons attention is you know what is the cons of< of actually you know turning the put of actually you know turning the put ratio< ratio spread to a 100% risk free ratio spread to a 100% risk free butterfly< butterfly because as you know I love my butterfly because as you know I love my put< put ratio spreads right so uh if you put ratio spreads right so uh if you were< were to turning into a 100% risk-free were to turning into a 100% risk-free butterfly< butterfly is there any catch right so butterfly is there any catch right so the< the only thing is that number one first the only thing is that number one first of< of all you may not actually have the of all you may not actually have the chance< chance to turn it into a 100% risk-free chance to turn it into a 100% risk-free butterfly< butterfly because it all depends on butterfly because it all depends on whether< whether this down here can actually go whether this down here can actually go down< down to below you know the credit that down to below you know the credit that you< you receive UPF front right so if you you receive UPF front right so if you receive< receive for 32 cents you need to wait receive for 32 cents you need to wait for< for that equidistant long put to for that equidistant long put to actually< actually drop below 32 cents for you to actually drop below 32 cents for you to convert< convert it into a risk-free butterfly convert it into a risk-free butterfly but< but let's say for example if the market but let's say for example if the market trades< trades down from the moment you put on trades down from the moment you put on the< the put ratio spread then chances are the put ratio spread then chances are this< this price down here this lput it's this price down here this lput it's going< going to be increased right it's going to be increased right it's definitely< definitely most likely going to be much definitely most likely going to be much more< more than 32 cents because now that put more than 32 cents because now that put option< option is going to be slightly closer to option is going to be slightly closer to where< where the current market price is as the where the current market price is as the market< market trades down so it's not always market trades down so it's not always that< that you can actually construct you know that you can actually construct you know every< every put ratio spread and turn it into every put ratio spread and turn it into a< a 100% risk-free butterfly it really a 100% risk-free butterfly it really depends< depends on the underlying and and also depends on the underlying and and also you< you know whether the Decay is fast you know whether the Decay is fast enough< enough to reach a point where it's enough to reach a point where it's lesser< lesser than the credit so that's the lesser than the credit so that's the very< very first point now the second Point very first point now the second Point let's< let's say for example you are actually let's say for example you are actually able< able to turn it into a risk-free able to turn it into a risk-free butterfly< butterfly then the conss or rather the butterfly then the conss or rather the thing< thing that you're going to give up is thing that you're going to give up is pretty< pretty much just this credit down here pretty much just this credit down here right< right so this amount you have to right so this amount you have to actually< actually uh pay for it right it's 25 actually uh pay for it right it's 25 cents< cents which means it's $25 what it means cents which means it's $25 what it means is< is just this right so this is where the is just this right so this is where the current< current market price is okay this is the current market price is okay this is the market< market price so let's say for example if market price so let's say for example if you< you put on the put ratio spread and the you put on the put ratio spread and the market< market actually stays above around here market actually stays above around here at< at this point or maybe the market goes at this point or maybe the market goes up< up if you did not actually buy this long up if you did not actually buy this long put< put for 25 cents then you would have put for 25 cents then you would have actually< actually gotten the full 32 cents in actually gotten the full 32 cents in terms< terms of the premium you receive up terms of the premium you receive up front< front right so it's a $32 profit for you front right so it's a $32 profit for you up< up front but because you've actually up front but because you've actually bought< bought this long put then you have given bought this long put then you have given up< up $25 which means to say if the market up $25 which means to say if the market just< just stays somewhere down here right just stays somewhere down here right basically< basically above where your tent is then basically above where your tent is then you're< you're only going to get roughly about you're only going to get roughly about $8< $8 right 8 C so that is pretty much the $8 right 8 C so that is pretty much the only< only con that you're going to have for only con that you're going to have for converting< converting the put ratio spread into the converting the put ratio spread into the 100%< 100% risk-free butterfly all right so 100% risk-free butterfly all right so this< this is how you get a 100% risk-free this is how you get a 100% risk-free butterfly< butterfly and if you like this video I butterfly and if you like this video I greatly< greatly appreciate if you give me a greatly appreciate if you give me a thumbs< thumbs up on this video by the

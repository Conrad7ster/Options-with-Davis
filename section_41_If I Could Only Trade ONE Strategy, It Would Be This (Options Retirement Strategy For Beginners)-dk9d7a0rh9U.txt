Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about one we're going to be talking about one option< option strategy that you can use for option strategy that you can use for retirement< retirement right so if you're the kind retirement right so if you're the kind of< of person that you know you don't like of person that you know you don't like to< to trade many different kind of to trade many different kind of strategies< strategies you just want one strategy strategies you just want one strategy that< that you can trade over and over again that you can trade over and over again and< and you were to ask me you know what and you were to ask me you know what would< would I suggest then I would say it would I suggest then I would say it would< would be this strategy so what is this would be this strategy so what is this strategy< strategy well this strategy is what I strategy well this strategy is what I call< call the put ratio spread retirement call the put ratio spread retirement strategy< strategy right so we're going to use the strategy right so we're going to use the put< put r spread and train it in a way where put r spread and train it in a way where it< it will suit our retirement purposes so it will suit our retirement purposes so first< first of all what exactly is the put first of all what exactly is the put ratio< ratio spread so if you're not familiar ratio spread so if you're not familiar with< with the put ratio spread the way that I with the put ratio spread the way that I like< like to see it is a combination of two like to see it is a combination of two different< different strategies right two different different strategies right two different strategies< strategies both are simple on its own so strategies both are simple on its own so the< the very first strategy is what is the very first strategy is what is called< called the short putut right so with the called the short putut right so with the short< short putut when you sell the put option short putut when you sell the put option you're< you're going to receive a premium for it you're going to receive a premium for it right< right so this is the first part of it right so this is the first part of it you're< you're going to receive a credit for you're going to receive a credit for selling< selling this put option now with this selling this put option now with this credit< credit that you receive what you're credit that you receive what you're going< going to do is that you're going to buy going to do is that you're going to buy a< a put spread right so this is what you a put spread right so this is what you call< call a put debit spread or a long put call a put debit spread or a long put spread< spread or you can also call it you know spread or you can also call it you know the< the bare put spread so for this long put the bare put spread so for this long put spread< spread what's going to happen is that spread what's going to happen is that you're< you're actually going to pay a premium you're actually going to pay a premium for< for that so the whole idea down here is for that so the whole idea down here is that< that you're using the premium which you that you're using the premium which you receive< receive for the short putut to fin the receive for the short putut to fin the purchase< purchase of the long put spread right so purchase of the long put spread right so as< as you can see down here you will have as you can see down here you will have two< two short puts and one long put so when two short puts and one long put so when you< you combine it together basically it you combine it together basically it will< will look like this so the whole idea will look like this so the whole idea down< down here is that the short putut part down here is that the short putut part of< of the long put spread as you can see of the long put spread as you can see over< over here is actually sharing the same over here is actually sharing the same strike< strike price as the one sh put on the strike price as the one sh put on the left< left hand side right so if you combine left hand side right so if you combine them< them together you will see that there them together you will see that there are< are two short puts at one strike and are two short puts at one strike and then< then on top of it you have one long put then on top of it you have one long put right< right so some people take a look at this right so some people take a look at this and< and they say hey there's two short puts and they say hey there's two short puts isn't< isn't it double the risk so it's not isn't it double the risk so it's not double< double the risk because for one of them double the risk because for one of them you< you actually already have this long put you actually already have this long put right< right so it's being covered by this long right so it's being covered by this long put< put so how you want to see it again like put so how you want to see it again like I< I mentioned you want to see it as a long I mentioned you want to see it as a long put< put spread and then one additional short put spread and then one additional short put< put at the side okay so this is the put put at the side okay so this is the put ratio< ratio spread so again the whole idea ratio spread so again the whole idea down< down here is that you're using the short down here is that you're using the short putut< putut to finance the purchase of the putut to finance the purchase of the long< long put spread so here's an example so long put spread so here's an example so let's< let's say you sell one short putut right let's say you sell one short putut right you< you sell the short putut and you receive you sell the short putut and you receive $3< $3 in credit for it so for every short $3 in credit for it so for every short putut< putut that you sell that is $300 you're putut that you sell that is $300 you're going< going to receive in premium now with going to receive in premium now with this< this $3 credit that you receive you're this $3 credit that you receive you're going< going to use a part of it to buy the put going to use a part of it to buy the put debit< debit spread right so as you can see debit spread right so as you can see down< down here if you buy the long put spread down here if you buy the long put spread for< for a dollar then the overall spread the for a dollar then the overall spread the put< put rtio spread when you combine them put rtio spread when you combine them together< together the total credit you're going together the total credit you're going to< to receive is $2 right so that means to receive is $2 right so that means you're< you're going to receive $200 per put you're going to receive $200 per put ratio< ratio spread so this is the whole gist ratio spread so this is the whole gist of< of the put ratio spread how you're going of the put ratio spread how you're going to< to construct it now you might be asking to construct it now you might be asking hey< hey Davis why do I want to add the long hey Davis why do I want to add the long put< put spread right wouldn't it be much put spread right wouldn't it be much more< more simpler if I just had you know just more simpler if I just had you know just the< the short putut and that is a good the short putut and that is a good question< question so there is a reason why we question so there is a reason why we want< want to use the long putut spread and want to use the long putut spread and that< that is because we want to use it as a that is because we want to use it as a defensive< defensive measure right because one of defensive measure right because one of the< the things that a lot of people are the things that a lot of people are afraid< afraid of whenever they you know do the afraid of whenever they you know do the short< short putut is what if the market comes short putut is what if the market comes down< down right if the market comes down this down right if the market comes down this is< is where they're going to panic right is where they're going to panic right because< because they got a short putut they because they got a short putut they don't< don't want the market to come down so don't want the market to come down so they< they you know are afraid right but with they you know are afraid right but with the< the put ratio spread you have this long the put ratio spread you have this long put< put spread so it is like a defensive put spread so it is like a defensive measure< measure so in case if the market measure so in case if the market actually< actually comes down we actually have actually comes down we actually have like< like a semi hatch in place right not a like a semi hatch in place right not a full< full hedge of course a semi hch in a full hedge of course a semi hch in a sense< sense whereby if the market comes down sense whereby if the market comes down you< you can actually still make some profit you can actually still make some profit from< from the put debit spread portion right from the put debit spread portion right because< because the put debit spread is a because the put debit spread is a bearish< bearish strategy right so the short bearish strategy right so the short putut< putut is a semi bullish strategy right putut is a semi bullish strategy right depending< depending on how far away your short depending on how far away your short putut< putut is but generally it is a neutral putut is but generally it is a neutral to< to bullish strategy in the sense whereby to bullish strategy in the sense whereby you< you want the market to go up to make you want the market to go up to make money< money whereas for the long put spread money whereas for the long put spread it's< it's very clearcut that you want the it's very clearcut that you want the market< market to go down in order for the long market to go down in order for the long put< put spread to make money so what you put spread to make money so what you have< have down here is a combination of a have down here is a combination of a bullish< bullish and a bearish strategy so bullish and a bearish strategy so whenever< whenever we put on any strategy of whenever we put on any strategy of course< course if you put on a bullish strategy course if you put on a bullish strategy we< we want the market to go up right but we want the market to go up right but how< how good are we in picking the direction how good are we in picking the direction right< right if you're already so confident right if you're already so confident thinking< thinking that the market is going to go thinking that the market is going to go up< up then don't get into options right up then don't get into options right just< just buy the stock outright the market just buy the stock outright the market if< if it goes up you're going to make even if it goes up you're going to make even more< more than just selling the put option so more than just selling the put option so the< the reason we want to put the long put the reason we want to put the long put spread< spread in place is also because we're spread in place is also because we're not< not very sure if the market really will not very sure if the market really will go< go up right nobody can really predict go up right nobody can really predict the< the market 100% I mean if you can then the market 100% I mean if you can then of< of course you're a genius you should be of course you're a genius you should be a< a millionaire by now or a a millionaire by now or a multi-billionaire< multi-billionaire by now you shouldn't multi-billionaire by now you shouldn't be< be watching this video right but for the be watching this video right but for the most< most part all of us Mortals the rest of most part all of us Mortals the rest of us< us we're not sure so we want to have us we're not sure so we want to have this< this long put spread as a defensive this long put spread as a defensive measure< measure the market comes down we can measure the market comes down we can still< still make some profit on that put debit still make some profit on that put debit spread< spread and at the same time if the spread and at the same time if the market< market goes up we will actually still be market goes up we will actually still be in< in a profit right because remember we in a profit right because remember we receive< receive a credit for this whole put receive a credit for this whole put ratio< ratio spread so we're not that worried ratio spread so we're not that worried and< and if the market comes down we actually and if the market comes down we actually also< also look forward to it because we have also look forward to it because we have the< the long put spread in place now the the long put spread in place now the next< next question you might have is Davis next question you might have is Davis how< how do I make money with this strategy how do I make money with this strategy so< so there are a few scenarios that we so there are a few scenarios that we actually< actually can profit with this strategy actually can profit with this strategy and< and I'm going to share it with you right and I'm going to share it with you right so< so the very first scenario is if the so the very first scenario is if the stock< stock actually expires above the put stock actually expires above the put ratio< ratio spread right so this is our ratio spread right so this is our structure< structure down here so anywhere above structure down here so anywhere above this< this structure it will expire worthless this structure it will expire worthless right< right basically because you know it did right basically because you know it did not< not come down right if it did not come not come down right if it did not come down< down the profit which we're going to get down the profit which we're going to get is< is pretty much the full credit that you is pretty much the full credit that you receive< receive for putting on this strategy so receive for putting on this strategy so if< if you recall the example earlier I said if you recall the example earlier I said that< that you know you put up this put ratio that you know you put up this put ratio spread< spread you receive a total credit of $2 spread you receive a total credit of $2 right< right so for every put ratio spread you right so for every put ratio spread you will< will receive $200 so this is a very will receive $200 so this is a very straightforward< straightforward scenario now scenario straightforward scenario now scenario number< number two what if the stock actually number two what if the stock actually goes< goes below the long putut but it goes below the long putut but it actually< actually stays above the short puts so actually stays above the short puts so right< right now as you can see it actually right now as you can see it actually went< went in between our structure down here went in between our structure down here so< so at this point of time what exactly do so at this point of time what exactly do we< we do so if you do actually have this we do so if you do actually have this scenario< scenario it actually is good for you scenario it actually is good for you right< right because you are actually going to right because you are actually going to be< be in a profit as long as it stays be in a profit as long as it stays somewhere< somewhere there close to expiration somewhere there close to expiration right< right so once it's near expiration all right so once it's near expiration all you< you got to do right is just close out you got to do right is just close out the< the whole spread right close out this the whole spread right close out this put< put ratio spread for a profit right so put ratio spread for a profit right so as< as you can see down here this is the p&amp;l as you can see down here this is the p&amp;l graph< graph of the put ratio spread so as you graph of the put ratio spread so as you can< can see down here there are two puts can see down here there are two puts down< down here so this corresponds. to this down here so this corresponds to this one< one down here and then you have one long one down here and then you have one long put< put so this one long put is down here so put so this one long put is down here so you< you can see down here this is where the you can see down here this is where the market< market price is right so this also you market price is right so this also you know< know coincides with where the current know coincides with where the current market< market price is down here so that means market price is down here so that means to< to say if the market actually comes down to say if the market actually comes down here< here and stays between the put options here and stays between the put options right< right that means the two short puts and right that means the two short puts and the< the one long put you are actually going the one long put you are actually going to< to make more than if the market actually to make more than if the market actually went< went up right so you can see down here went up right so you can see down here if< if the market actually went up all if the market actually went up all you're< you're going to get is just the credit you're going to get is just the credit which< which you Reed for putting on the which you Reed for putting on the strategy< strategy but as the market actually strategy but as the market actually comes< comes down you notice that the max comes down you notice that the max profit< profit is actually near where the short profit is actually near where the short puts< puts are right in fact the max profit is puts are right in fact the max profit is right< right at where the short putut is so if right at where the short putut is so if it< it actually stays between these two puts it actually stays between these two puts down< down here then actually you will be in a down here then actually you will be in a better< better profit right let me just draw a better profit right let me just draw a line< line down here so somewhere down here or line down here so somewhere down here or let< let me just shade it this whole area let me just shade it this whole area down< down here right as long it's below the down here right as long it's below the long< long put above the two short puts then long put above the two short puts then your< your profit is going to be greater than your profit is going to be greater than what< what you would get if the market goes up what you would get if the market goes up right< right basically you get more than the right basically you get more than the credit< credit so why is that so and the reason credit so why is that so and the reason is< is because remember I told you about the is because remember I told you about the long< long put spread when the long put spread long put spread when the long put spread is< is in play When the market Comes Down is in play When the market Comes Down The< The Long put spread actually helps you The Long put spread actually helps you make< make money as well so that is why you make money as well so that is why you actually< actually make more than if the market actually make more than if the market was< was to go up and you just receed the was to go up and you just receed the credit< credit right so if you think about it credit right so if you think about it this< this way you're actually paying money this way you're actually paying money for< for the put debit spread so if the for the put debit spread so if the market< market actually go goes above the put market actually go goes above the put debit< debit spread so let me just remove all debit spread so let me just remove all this< this again so let's say if the market this again so let's say if the market stays< stays above the put debit spread your stays above the put debit spread your put< put debit spread actually lost money put debit spread actually lost money because< because you actually paid for it right because you actually paid for it right so< so you actually do not get anything from so you actually do not get anything from the< the put deit spread you lost whatever the put deit spread you lost whatever you< you sort of you know used to finance you sort of you know used to finance this< this put debit spread but if the market this put debit spread but if the market comes< comes down now your put debit spread comes down now your put debit spread actually< actually makes money so down here you actually makes money so down here you have< have a combination of two things you have a combination of two things you have< have the credit which you receive UPF have the credit which you receive UPF front< front plus you get a profit for closing front plus you get a profit for closing out< out the debit spread which is in profit out the debit spread which is in profit all< all right so this is for scenario number all right so this is for scenario number two< two now scenario number three what if two now scenario number three what if the< the stock actually goes below the put the stock actually goes below the put ratio< ratio spread right so if you were to ratio spread right so if you were to just< just go back to this graph down here you just go back to this graph down here you notice< notice that even though if it goes below notice that even though if it goes below the< the put ratio spread that means let's the put ratio spread that means let's say< say for example somewhere down here let say for example somewhere down here let me< me just remove this drawing again and me just remove this drawing again and I'll< I'll draw this so that means we just go I'll draw this so that means we just go slightly< slightly below the two shuts if you slightly below the two shuts if you actually< actually go slightly below the two short actually go slightly below the two short puts< puts you notice that at expiration we puts you notice that at expiration we actually< actually still going to be in a profit actually still going to be in a profit right< right at this point down here it's going right at this point down here it's going to< to be you know a pretty nice profit but to be you know a pretty nice profit but we< we actually do not want to hold it to we actually do not want to hold it to exploration< exploration why is that so well because exploration why is that so well because if< if you're going to trade this on if you're going to trade this on individual< individual stocks right or even on index individual stocks right or even on index ETFs< ETFs these two shuts is going to get ETFs these two shuts is going to get assigned< assigned at expiration right so for assigned at expiration right so for scenar< scenar number three if the stock goes scenar number three if the stock goes below< below the put ratio spread what we want below the put ratio spread what we want to< to do is that we're going to separate to do is that we're going to separate this< this tra stry into the two components this tra stry into the two components which< which we talked about right the short which we talked about right the short putut< putut and then the long putut spread putut and then the long putut spread because< because now we're going to manage them because now we're going to manage them separately< separately so bear with me here just uh separately so bear with me here just uh really< really pay attention to this part really pay attention to this part because< because it's quite important so the because it's quite important so the first< first step you want to do once the first step you want to do once the market< market actually goes below the whole put market actually goes below the whole put ratio< ratio spread construct that means below ratio spread construct that means below the< the short put this is where your put the short put this is where your put debit< debit spread will be in a profit now at debit spread will be in a profit now at this< this point in time you can actually this point in time you can actually close< close it out for a profit now that you close it out for a profit now that you have< have already closed out the put that have already closed out the put that spread< spread you are left with just the short spread you are left with just the short putut< putut so what do you do with the short putut so what do you do with the short putut< putut right so there are two methods putut right so there are two methods that< that you can do right now number one you that you can do right now number one you can< can leave it to expiration because can leave it to expiration because remember< remember the whole idea down here is remember the whole idea down here is that< that you actually do not mind getting that you actually do not mind getting into< into the long stock position right the into the long stock position right the way< way we want to trade put ratio spread is way we want to trade put ratio spread is a< a way whereby we don't mind getting into a way whereby we don't mind getting into the< the stock and then if we are in the the stock and then if we are in the stock< stock position the market goes up again stock position the market goes up again we're< we're going to profit on the shares that we're going to profit on the shares that we< we got assigned on so method number one we got assigned on so method number one you< you leave it to exploration you leave it to exploration two< two things can happen the first thing is two things can happen the first thing is that< that if the stock goes back up by that if the stock goes back up by expiration< expiration that means it expires expiration that means it expires actually< actually worthless then you actually do actually worthless then you actually do not< not have to worry about anything because not have to worry about anything because right< right now you made the full profit on right now you made the full profit on the< the short put side because the credit the short put side because the credit whatever< whatever you receed you got it and then whatever you receed you got it and then you< you also sold the put debit spread you you also sold the put debit spread you got< got a profit there as well right so this got a profit there as well right so this is< is a good scenario for you now the is a good scenario for you now the second< second scenario after using method second scenario after using method number< number one is that if the stock stays number one is that if the stock stays below< below the sh putut at expiration you below the sh putut at expiration you will< will get a sign right you get 100 shares will get a sign right you get 100 shares and< and this is actually what we want so and this is actually what we want so remember< remember the whole idea of this put remember the whole idea of this put ratio< ratio spread strategy is we actually ratio spread strategy is we actually don't< don't mind getting into a long stock don't mind getting into a long stock position< position right a very simple way is to position right a very simple way is to just< just get into the shares if the market just get into the shares if the market goes< goes up and then you get a profit from goes up and then you get a profit from there< there as well now method number two is there as well now method number two is that< that you can actually roll the shut that you can actually roll the shut right< right so how do you roll the shut you right so how do you roll the shut you can< can roll the shut simply by roll pulling can roll the shut simply by roll pulling out< out to a further DTE and to a lower out to a further DTE and to a lower strike< strike price so for example if there's strike price so for example if there's maybe< maybe let's say there's 15 DTE left in maybe let's say there's 15 DTE left in this< this shut right and then you just roll this shut right and then you just roll it< it so what you want to do is you want to it so what you want to do is you want to roll< roll it to maybe a higher DTE so it roll it to maybe a higher DTE so it depends< depends on what you can get right and depends on what you can get right and also< also how low of a strike price you want also how low of a strike price you want to< to go to but basically when you're to go to but basically when you're rolling< rolling you can actually get an rolling you can actually get an additional< additional credit and at a lower strike additional credit and at a lower strike price< price so maybe this time you want to price so maybe this time you want to roll< roll it to 30 roll it to 30 DTE< DTE and then you want to roll the strike DTE and then you want to roll the strike price< price further down right so whatever the price further down right so whatever the price< price is so maybe if originally it was price is so maybe if originally it was $50< $50 then you want to roll it down to $50 then you want to roll it down to maybe< maybe $48 depending on what you can get maybe $48 depending on what you can get on< on the option chain so when you do this on the option chain so when you do this you< you can actually get a credit at the you can actually get a credit at the same< same time you leave more room for the same time you leave more room for the market< market to actually have a possibility to market to actually have a possibility to go< go back up then this whole sh putut go back up then this whole sh putut again< again will expire worthless now what if again will expire worthless now what if it< it goes down well if it goes down then it goes down well if it goes down then guess< guess what you can go back to Method guess what you can go back to Method number< number one again right method number one number one again right method number one that< that means you can either just leave that means you can either just leave that< that to exploration see whether you get that to exploration see whether you get assigned< assigned or if you can roll it again you assigned or if you can roll it again you can< can choose to roll it even further down can choose to roll it even further down and< and if you get assigned again this time and if you get assigned again this time you< you will get a lower strike price right you will get a lower strike price right you< you will buy the shares at a lower price you will buy the shares at a lower price so< so this actually is a very good scenario so this actually is a very good scenario for< for us because if you actually get for us because if you actually get assigned< assigned the shares and then the market assigned the shares and then the market shoots< shoots back up you make on a lot of shoots back up you make on a lot of wayte< wayte right you make on the put debit wayte right you make on the put debit spread< spread you also receive the credit for spread you also receive the credit for the< the shut and then for the shares you're the shut and then for the shares you're going< going to make profit if the market goes going to make profit if the market goes up< up right so there'll be a capital gain up right so there'll be a capital gain so< so at this point in time you might be so at this point in time you might be asking< asking Davis this sounds all fine and asking Davis this sounds all fine and dandy< dandy right it sounds so good but where dandy right it sounds so good but where is< is the risk in this strategy by the way is the risk in this strategy by the way if< if you like this video so far Please if you like this video so far Please Subscribe< Subscribe and also

com blueprint all< all right back to the video well that's all right back to the video well that's a< a very good question because we must a very good question because we must always< always find out what is the risk in the always find out what is the risk in the strategy< strategy and the risk is if the market strategy and the risk is if the market keeps< keeps going down right so for example in keeps going down right so for example in scenario< scenario number three you get assigned scenario number three you get assigned the< the shares the market keeps keeps going the shares the market keeps keeps going down< down so if the market keeps going down down so if the market keeps going down you're< you're going to start to lose on your you're going to start to lose on your shares< shares all right so in this case what do shares all right so in this case what do you< you do right how do you reduce the risk you do right how do you reduce the risk okay< okay so I'm going to share with you a okay so I'm going to share with you a few< few ways that you can reduce the risk so few ways that you can reduce the risk so uh< uh really take some notes if you can so uh really take some notes if you can so the< the very first thing you want to do is the very first thing you want to do is to< to keep a watch list of stocks that you to keep a watch list of stocks that you actually< actually don't mind owning right so actually don't mind owning right so ideally< ideally you want to go for fundamentally ideally you want to go for fundamentally good< good stocks or index ETFs right so if good stocks or index ETFs right so if you< you go for stocks that you know in the you go for stocks that you know in the long< long term it's going to keep going up long term it's going to keep going up you< you actually do not mind getting into you actually do not mind getting into the< the long stock right so for some people the long stock right so for some people they< they like to you know buy more they like to you know buy more speculative< speculative stocks for example I've had speculative stocks for example I've had people< people that say you know I like GameStop people that say you know I like GameStop right< right they're waiting for roaring Kitty right they're waiting for roaring Kitty to< to maybe suddenly come up with a tweet to maybe suddenly come up with a tweet the< the stock shoots up right that's all up the stock shoots up right that's all up to< to you right basically you want to keep to you right basically you want to keep a< a watch list of stocks that you do not a watch list of stocks that you do not mind< mind owning so even though if you're mind owning so even though if you're long< long the stock you're okay with that now long the stock you're okay with that now the< the next way that you can reduce the the next way that you can reduce the risk< risk is to actually identify the stocks risk is to actually identify the stocks that< that are currently undervalue right so that are currently undervalue right so you< you already have a watch list of the you already have a watch list of the stocks< stocks you don't mind owning and most of stocks you don't mind owning and most of them< them hopefully is fundamentally good them hopefully is fundamentally good stocks< stocks then what you can do is that you stocks then what you can do is that you can< can go to some of the sites down here can go to some of the sites down here right< right for example simply Wall Street or right for example simply Wall Street or Guru< Guru Focus or Morning Star so on so Guru Focus or Morning Star so on so forth< forth right there are a number of the forth right there are a number of the sites< sites where they actually you know tell sites where they actually you know tell you< you what is the value of it whether is you what is the value of it whether is it< it undervalue or overv value now each s it undervalue or overv value now each s might< might have their own valuation so what might have their own valuation so what you< you want to do is that you just want to you want to do is that you just want to go< go through you know all the size and go through you know all the size and then< then just maybe get an aggregate of it then just maybe get an aggregate of it or< or just find the one that has you know or just find the one that has you know the< the the one that makes sense to you most the the one that makes sense to you most or< or whereby you know you find one where or whereby you know you find one where the< the fair value is the lowest all right the fair value is the lowest all right so< so out of those stocks you want to find so out of those stocks you want to find the< the one that is undervalued because now the one that is undervalued because now you< you have an additional defense mechanism you have an additional defense mechanism right< right because you may have actually right because you may have actually fundamentally< fundamentally good stocks that you want fundamentally good stocks that you want to< to go long which you don't mind owning to go long which you don't mind owning the< the shares but if you get it at a price the shares but if you get it at a price where< where it's too expensive right if it's where it's too expensive right if it's above< above the fair value then it could take above the fair value then it could take quite< quite some time before the market comes quite some time before the market comes back< back up again if it keeps going down back up again if it keeps going down right< right and that is why you know if you right and that is why you know if you find< find it undervalue again then this would find it undervalue again then this would be< be one other way that you can further be one other way that you can further reduce< reduce risk whereby if you actually do reduce risk whereby if you actually do get< get long let's say for example you get get long let's say for example you get assigned< assigned on that short putut you now at assigned on that short putut you now at least< least have the conviction to hold on to least have the conviction to hold on to those< those shares because you can see that those shares because you can see that it's< it's undervalue right so for example as it's undervalue right so for example as an< an example we're just going to use this an example we're just going to use this price< price right for some people you know if price right for some people you know if you< you find this too expensive go for the you find this too expensive go for the cheaper< cheaper stocks right so let's say for cheaper stocks right so let's say for example< example for this you can see that the example for this you can see that the fair< fair value down here and the current fair value down here and the current price< price is quite a big difference right so price is quite a big difference right so if< if you think that this fair value is if you think that this fair value is pretty< pretty accurate then even though you get pretty accurate then even though you get assigned< assigned at the current price you don't assigned at the current price you don't have< have to worry right you can just hold on have to worry right you can just hold on to< to it right for example in 2022 where a to it right for example in 2022 where a lot< lot of the stocks right they went so far lot of the stocks right they went so far down< down that you know a lot of people panic down that you know a lot of people panic they< they close up their stocks but if if you they close up their stocks but if if you already< already understood the stock that you already understood the stock that you are< are buying the company and you think are buying the company and you think that< that it's undervalued you can hold on to that it's undervalued you can hold on to it< it and then the market will eventually it and then the market will eventually come< come back up as it did right as you can come back up as it did right as you can see< see in 2023 2024 the market just shot see in 2023 2024 the market just shot back< back up that is why you know certain back up that is why you know certain stocks< stocks like Google meta Amazon if you stocks like Google meta Amazon if you had< had entered them at a price where you had entered them at a price where you know< know it was undervalued then you know it was undervalued then you definitely< definitely would have the conviction definitely would have the conviction holding< holding power to hold on to it until the holding power to hold on to it until the market< market eventually comes up now the third market eventually comes up now the third one< one is to wait for a good setup right so one is to wait for a good setup right so we< we already have quite a number of we already have quite a number of defensive< defensive measures now this will be the defensive measures now this will be the final< final defensive measure right so what is final defensive measure right so what is a< a good setup so this is something that a good setup so this is something that I've< I've talked about in quite a number of I've talked about in quite a number of videos< videos so this is a very good way videos so this is a very good way especially< especially if you're new to trading especially if you're new to trading options< options then this good. setup you can use options then this good setup you can use is< is number one just put on the stochastic is number one just put on the stochastic oscillator< oscillator right so the stochastic oscillator right so the stochastic oscillator< oscillator basically just measures the oscillator basically just measures the condition< condition of the market right is it condition of the market right is it overbought< overbought or is it oversold so as you overbought or is it oversold so as you can< can see down here I've circled it in can see down here I've circled it in rate< rate already as long as it goes below rate already as long as it goes below this< this line at the bottom it considered this line at the bottom it considered overs< overs so that means to say that the overs so that means to say that the market< market has already sold off quite a bit market has already sold off quite a bit and< and the chances of it you know going and the chances of it you know going back< back up at least would be slightly back up at least would be slightly better< better than if it were to continue going better than if it were to continue going down< down right of course that is not to say down right of course that is not to say that< that the market won't continue to go that the market won't continue to go down< down it can right but you've already down it can right but you've already reached< reached a point whereby it's really reached a point whereby it's really pretty< pretty overs soap right and you've got pretty overs soap right and you've got this< this two points down here as well that this two points down here as well that gives< gives you further conviction that if gives you further conviction that if you're< you're assigned you can hold on to it you're assigned you can hold on to it right< right so if it's oversold definitely right so if it's oversold definitely it's< it's a much better position for you to it's a much better position for you to put< put on the put ratio spread than if it's put on the put ratio spread than if it's overbought< overbought right you notice that every overbought right you notice that every time< time if it's overbought take a look at time if it's overbought take a look at the< the chart right this is where the market the chart right this is where the market has< has gone up quite high right that is why has gone up quite high right that is why the< the stochastic label it as overbought the stochastic label it as overbought right< right so if at this point if you were to right so if at this point if you were to put< put the put ratio spread right the put the put ratio spread right the market< market could just come tumbling down market could just come tumbling down very< very quickly and you may not necessarily very quickly and you may not necessarily be< be you know comfortable holding on to be you know comfortable holding on to the< the shares if you get sign right so wait the shares if you get sign right so wait till< till the stochastics oversold and next till the stochastics oversold and next one< one the final one identify support level one the final one identify support level so< so if the over so reading is not enough so if the over so reading is not enough you< you also want an additional defensive you also want an additional defensive measure< measure whereby you find places where measure whereby you find places where the< the prices find it very difficult to go the prices find it very difficult to go below< below right so these are what you call below right so these are what you call support< support levels so you can see that support levels so you can see that prices< prices have bounced off several times prices have bounced off several times and< and then it went back up now it come and then it went back up now it come back< back down and then it's about to test back down and then it's about to test this< this support level right so doesn't mean this support level right so doesn't mean the< the support level it's going to hold all the support level it's going to hold all the< the time it's just that you know again the time it's just that you know again everything< everything about trading and options is everything about trading and options is about< about probability at least you have a about probability at least you have a better< better chance of it going up so if it better chance of it going up so if it does< does go up then the whole put ratio does go up then the whole put ratio spread< spread expire worthless you just make spread expire worthless you just make the< the full credit that you receive for the full credit that you receive for putting< putting on the put ratio spread but if putting on the put ratio spread but if it< it does go down despite all the measures it does go down despite all the measures that< that we have in place and then now that we have in place and then now you're< you're assigned the 100 shares then you're assigned the 100 shares then guess< guess what you are already at a point guess what you are already at a point whereby< whereby the market is pretty pretty whereby the market is pretty pretty overs< overs right it has gone through quite a overs right it has gone through quite a bit< bit and that is not to say it won't go bit and that is not to say it won't go further< further down but there is a chance that further down but there is a chance that there< there could be a retracement back up there could be a retracement back up right< right or even a reversal and at the right or even a reversal and at the point< point as long as you are in a profit you point as long as you are in a profit you can< can choose to close out those 100 shares can choose to close out those 100 shares all< all right so once you've identified all all right so once you've identified all this< this this is where you can construct the this this is where you can construct the put< put ratio spread right basically you put ratio spread right basically you want< want to construct the put ratio spread want to construct the put ratio spread below< below this support level okay so I've below this support level okay so I've already< already given you quite a number of already given you quite a number of defensive< defensive measures that you can use to defensive measures that you can use to further< further reduce the risk of this strategy further reduce the risk of this strategy so< so now let's get into trade construction so now let's get into trade construction because< because this is where a lot of people because this is where a lot of people will< will ask me Davis so for this strategy will ask me Davis so for this strategy what< what is the DTE which DTE should I go what is the DTE which DTE should I go for< for should I go for zero DTE or minus for should I go for zero DTE or minus one< one or minus 7 so that my profit you one or minus 7 so that my profit you know< know would have been already realized know would have been already realized before< before I actually put on the trade no before I actually put on the trade no okay< okay I'm just kidding right so the whole okay I'm just kidding right so the whole idea< idea down here is that whenever people idea down here is that whenever people ask< ask me DTE a lot of times they want to ask me DTE a lot of times they want to go< go for the shorter ones and yes I go for the shorter ones and yes I understand< understand why right we want to realize understand why right we want to realize the< the profit very quickly and here's the the profit very quickly and here's the thing< thing about this strategy for the most thing about this strategy for the most part< part whenever I talk about you know DTE part whenever I talk about you know DTE with< with a lot of the strategies that I with a lot of the strategies that I shared< shared on my channel I tend to go for shared on my channel I tend to go for above< above 45 DT because that's where our above 45 DT because that's where our Edge< Edge lies right the edge where the Edge lies right the edge where the realize< realize move is often time lesser than realize move is often time lesser than the< the expected move but for this strategy the expected move but for this strategy the< the TT selection is actually not that the TT selection is actually not that important< important because we actually don't mind important because we actually don't mind getting< getting into the shares right we don't getting into the shares right we don't mind< mind getting into a long stock position mind getting into a long stock position so< so with that said there is still some so with that said there is still some difference< difference between the shorter DTE and difference between the shorter DTE and the< the longer DTE that you need to know in the longer DTE that you need to know in order< order to crop the put ratio spread order to crop the put ratio spread according< according to your preference right so according to your preference right so now< now let's talk about the shorter DTE now let's talk about the shorter DTE first< first so with the shorter DTE you first so with the shorter DTE you actually< actually get a higher return right so actually get a higher return right so you< you notice down here the ROI is higher you notice down here the ROI is higher compared< compared to this one and how do you compared to this one and how do you calculate< calculate the RO I is actually pretty calculate the RO I is actually pretty simple< simple right you just take the credit simple right you just take the credit which< which you receive you you can see down which you receive you you can see down here here here 0. 34< 0.

34 which is $34 right and then you 0. 34 which is $34 right and then you divide< divide it by the strike Price Right divide it by the strike Price Right basically< basically the cost of the amount that basically the cost of the amount that you< you have to put up to Long 100 shares you have to put up to Long 100 shares for< for this right so basically if you were for this right so basically if you were to< to just calculate Roi divided by the DTE to just calculate Roi divided by the DTE *< * 365 that's how you're going to * 365 that's how you're going to calculate< calculate the ROI you will get a higher calculate the ROI you will get a higher return< return than the longer DTE right as you return than the longer DTE right as you can< can see down here I compare it with a 29 can see down here I compare it with a 29 DT DT DT but< but there are some slight differences but there are some slight differences where< where you might consider a longer DTE where you might consider a longer DTE right< right so for example you have lesser right so for example you have lesser premium< premium to purchase the long put spread premium to purchase the long put spread right< right you can see down here if you sell right you can see down here if you sell this< this 134 strike you get only 34 CS so 34 this 134 strike you get only 34 CS so 34 cents< cents is going to be quite difficult for cents is going to be quite difficult for you< you to buy you know a bigger put spread you to buy you know a bigger put spread because< because you don't have that much credit because you don't have that much credit and< and at the same time your put ratio and at the same time your put ratio spread< spread is going to be closer to where spread is going to be closer to where the< the current market price is right mainly the current market price is right mainly your< your short strike right so if you take a your short strike right so if you take a look< look at this down here 134 it's giving look at this down here 134 it's giving you< you only 34 cents that means to say that you only 34 cents that means to say that if< if you want to go for a further strike a if you want to go for a further strike a further< further away strike let's say maybe 130 further away strike let's say maybe 130 you're< you're not going to get that much credit you're not going to get that much credit already< already right it's going to be so little already right it's going to be so little that< that there's no point for you to even that there's no point for you to even put< put it on but whereas for the 29 DTE you put it on but whereas for the 29 DTE you notice< notice that hey you get notice that hey you get $243< $243 for the same strike price what does $243 for the same strike price what does this< this mean it means that if you were to this mean it means that if you were to go< go further out the market so maybe you go further out the market so maybe you can< can even go to 130 maybe 128 127 and you can even go to 130 maybe 128 127 and you find< find that there's still some credit so find that there's still some credit so why< why does this play an important part why does this play an important part because< because if the market actually comes because if the market actually comes down< down and you reach a point where you down and you reach a point where you want< want to actually get assigned or you want to actually get assigned or you have< have to get assigned then of course have to get assigned then of course you're< you're going to get a better entry price you're going to get a better entry price if< if you get a further away strike price if you get a further away strike price with< with the longer DTE down here right so with the longer DTE down here right so if< if you're going to get a sign is it if you're going to get a sign is it better< better for you to get long at maybe the better for you to get long at maybe the strike< strike price of $127 or at $134 of strike price of $127 or at $134 of course< course $127 so that is why you know course $127 so that is why you know longer< longer DTE will actually give you that longer DTE will actually give you that better< better strike price if you are going to better strike price if you are going to get< get into the long shares right so again get into the long shares right so again you< you get more premium to purchase the you get more premium to purchase the long< long put spread and a put raal spread is long put spread and a put raal spread is further< further away to market price only further away to market price only difference< difference or rather the small setback difference or rather the small setback is< is that it's a slightly lower Roi if you is that it's a slightly lower Roi if you would< would just you know get the credit but would just you know get the credit but for< for me I value more towards the risk for me I value more towards the risk side< side right if the risk is to the side right if the risk is to the downside< downside if I'm going to get into the downside if I'm going to get into the long< long shares I rather get it at a lower long shares I rather get it at a lower price< price than a higher price okay so this price than a higher price okay so this is< is on DTE selection now next let's talk is on DTE selection now next let's talk about< about shut strike selection where are we about shut strike selection where are we going< going to position our short putut right going to position our short putut right so< so there are two ways that you can do so there are two ways that you can do this< this now the very first way very simple this now the very first way very simple way< way is just price selection basically way is just price selection basically you< you choose the strike price at a place you choose the strike price at a place where< where you don't mind going long the where you don't mind going long the shares< shares at so let's say for example uh it shares at so let's say for example uh it could< could be at a price of $50 so let's say could be at a price of $50 so let's say for< for example you think that $50 is what for example you think that $50 is what you< you like then you can. place it at $50 you like then you can place it at $50 right< right if you are able to construct this right if you are able to construct this whole< whole put ratio spread for a pretty whole put ratio spread for a pretty decent< decent credit right so that's the first decent credit right so that's the first way< way the second way is that you can use way the second way is that you can use the< the Delta to select your short strip the Delta to select your short strip right< right so you use Delta as an indication right so you use Delta as an indication of< of the percentage chance of being in the of the percentage chance of being in the money< money at expiration so let's say for money at expiration so let's say for example< example you want only a 25% chance that example you want only a 25% chance that you< you could get Bri on the short put side you could get Bri on the short put side then< then you get assigned then at this place then you get assigned then at this place you< you can go for the 130 strike price now you can go for the 130 strike price now the< the final component is the long put the final component is the long put strike< strike selection so how do we Define strike selection so how do we Define where< where we put the laput strike so if you where we put the laput strike so if you have< have a more bullish Outlook then this is have a more bullish Outlook then this is where< where you want to go for the further out where you want to go for the further out of< of the money strike right so as you can of the money strike right so as you can see< see down here this is where the current see down here this is where the current market< market price is so out of the money will market price is so out of the money will be< be below this current price down here so be below this current price down here so basically< basically the lower the price is the basically the lower the price is the more< more further away it is and the cheaper more further away it is and the cheaper the< the put right so if it's much further the put right so if it's much further away< away then you notice that the purchase away then you notice that the purchase of< of this uh put is going to be much of this uh put is going to be much cheaper< cheaper so you're going to get a higher cheaper so you're going to get a higher credit< credit for the put ratio spread and a credit for the put ratio spread and a lower< lower Max profit for the long put spread lower Max profit for the long put spread right< right because your put spread right now right because your put spread right now is< is going to be smaller so this is if is going to be smaller so this is if you're< you're more bullish but if you're more you're more bullish but if you're more bearish< bearish you know you're not very sure or bearish you know you're not very sure or you< you want to be more defensive right you want to be more defensive right you're< you're afraid that you know the market you're afraid that you know the market is< is going to come down then in this case is going to come down then in this case you< you want to go for a nearer to where the you want to go for a nearer to where the current< current market price is the strike price current market price is the strike price there< there and it's going to be more there and it's going to be more expensive< expensive right as you can see down here expensive right as you can see down here because< because you're going closer to the because you're going closer to the current< current market price so at the money current market price so at the money strike< strike will always be more expensive strike will always be more expensive than< than further out of the money so for than further out of the money so for this< this is the good thing is that you have this is the good thing is that you have a< a much defensive uh structure if the a much defensive uh structure if the market< market comes down so you actually market comes down so you actually anticipate< anticipate the market to come down you anticipate the market to come down you want< want it to come down so that your put want it to come down so that your put spread< spread down here you can get a much spread down here you can get a much bigger< bigger profit right the trade-off is bigger profit right the trade-off is that< that you get a lower credit for the put that you get a lower credit for the put ratio< ratio spread that means if the market ratio spread that means if the market goes< goes up then your overall credit that goes up then your overall credit that you< you get is going to be lesser as you can you get is going to be lesser as you can see< see down here this is 50 Cents for the see down here this is 50 Cents for the previous< previous structure you actually get much previous structure you actually get much more< more right you get $2 if the market more right you get $2 if the market actually< actually goes up but for this if the actually goes up but for this if the market< market comes down then you're going to market comes down then you're going to get< get a higher Max profit for the long get a higher Max profit for the long putut< putut spread all right so this is the putut spread all right so this is the put< put ratio spread retirement strategy so put ratio spread retirement strategy so use< use it and let let me know what you use it and let let me know what you think< think in the comments below by the way think in the

### How I Made 6-Figures Using This QQQ LEAPS Option Strategy-SHNLK7o2Gc4
=========================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you a I'm going to be sharing with you a simple< simple yet highly profitable liap simple yet highly profitable liap strategy< strategy that you can use on QQQ that's strategy that you can use on QQQ that's already< already generated me over six figures so already generated me over six figures so first< first of all why did I decide to choose first of all why did I decide to choose QQQ< QQQ over the other index ETFs well the QQQ over the other index ETFs well the reason< reason actually pretty simple is because reason actually pretty simple is because in< in terms of performance QQQ actually in terms of performance QQQ actually does< does the best amongst the other main does the best amongst the other main major< major index ETFs so for example this is major index ETFs so for example this is the< the QQ here as you can see now I'm using the QQ. here as you can see now I'm using Yahoo< Yahoo finance so you can definitely just Yahoo finance so you can definitely just go< go to Yahoo finance and see this same go to Yahoo finance and see this same page< page as well so if you was to go to the page as well so if you was to go to the performance< performance tab over here on the left performance tab over here on the left and< and you go down to this trailing returns and you go down to this trailing returns over< over here you can see all the past over here you can see all the past returns< returns in terms of the number of uh returns in terms of the number of uh months< months and years so if you will take a months and years so if you will take a look< look at the five year Return of the QQQ look at the five year Return of the QQQ you< you can see that the return is about you can see that the return is about 19. 93%< 19.

93% % which is pretty close to 20% 19. 93% % which is pretty close to 20%. and< and the 10-year return is about 18.

2 n% and the 10-year return is about 18. 2 n% so< so this is the average return over the so. this is the average return over the past< past 10 years so 18.

2 n% is actually not past 10 years so 18. 2 n% is actually not too< too bad now if I was to compare this to too bad now if I was to compare this to the< the other index ETFs you will notice the other index ETFs you will notice that< that this return is actually better so that this return is actually better so if< if you was to compare this to. spy as you if you was to compare this to spy as you can< can see over here this is spy if you go can see over here this is spy if you go to< to the fiveyear return you can see that to the fiveyear return you can see that the< the fiveyear return the fiveyear return is< is only is only 14.

44%< 14. 44% and the 10year return is 133% so 14.

44% and the 10year return is 133% so QQ< QQ actually did better in terms of the QQ actually did better in terms of the performance< performance compared to spy and what performance compared to spy and what about< about for the other index ETFs if I was about for the other index ETFs if I was to< to compare. this to Russell then you can to compare this to Russell then you can see< see that the Russell really PS in see that the Russell really PS in comparison< comparison right as you can see over comparison right as you can see over here< here iwm the past 5 years is here iwm the past 5 years is 7. 28%< 7.

28% and the past 10 years only 7. 28% and the past 10 years only 7.

76%< 7. 76% so the QQ really overshadows the 7.

76% so the QQ really overshadows the iwm< iwm performance and finally the last of iwm performance and finally the last of the< the few major index ETFs will be the the few major index ETFs will be the diamonds< diamonds so diamonds is the Dow Jone diamonds so diamonds is the Dow. Jone industrial< industrial index so if I was to go down industrial index so if I was to go down here< here as well to see the returns you can here as well to see the returns you can see< see that the fire returns about see that the fire returns about 10. 39%< 10.

#### Topic 1

39% and the 10year returns is 10. 39% and the 10year returns is 11.

4%< 11. 4% so as you can see out of all the 11.

4% so as you can see out of all the major< major index ETFs QQQ has the best major index ETFs QQQ has the best performance< performance so that is why I want to use performance so that is why I want to use the< the liap strategy on QQQ so this liap the liap strategy on QQQ so this liap strategy< strategy which I'm going to be sharing strategy which I'm going to be sharing with< with you today is a very simple one and with you today is a very simple one and basically< basically it's a form of a stock basically it's a form of a stock replacement< replacement strategy that means instead replacement strategy that means instead of< of buying QQQ outright instead we buy of buying QQQ outright instead we buy and< and whole QQQ we're going to sort of and whole QQQ we're going to sort of invest< invest into the QQQ lips where we invest into the QQQ lips where we simulate< simulate a position of Buy and Hold so simulate a position of Buy and Hold so how< how do we do that so it's going to be a how do we do that so it's going to be a very< very very simple strategy so the very very simple strategy so the strategy< strategy just involves two steps so I'm strategy just involves two steps so I'm just< just going to very quickly just show you just going to very quickly just show you the< the two steps that you need to do for the two steps that you need to do for this< this strategy so the very first step is this strategy so the very first step is to< to just buy a deep in the money call it to just buy a deep in the money call it that< that is about more than one year in that is about more than one year in terms< terms of the terms of the DTE< DTE so I want one that is very long DTE so I want one that is very long dated< dated and the reason why I want one that dated and the reason why I want one that is< is very long dated because that's where is very long dated because that's where the< the Theta Decay is not going to be as the Theta Decay is not going to be as high< high compared to if you were to go for a high compared to if you were to go for a lower< lower DTE so as you know the Theta Decay lower DTE so as you know the Theta Decay is< is exponential as it gets closer and. is exponential as it gets closer and closer< closer to the expiration date that's closer to the expiration date that's when< when the extrinsic value inside the call when the extrinsic value inside the call option< option in this case the call lip is option in this case the call lip is going< going to start to Decay very rapidly so going to start to Decay very rapidly so to< to reduce the effect of this Decay we to reduce the effect of this Decay we want< want to go to very far out in terms of want to go to very far out in terms of time< time so that's why I choose roughly more time so that's why I choose roughly more than< than a year than a year and< and the Second Step basically is to just and the Second Step basically is to just roll< roll at around 60 to 90 DTE and where do roll at around 60 to 90 DTE and where do you< you roll it to basically you just roll you roll it to basically you just roll it< it back to step number one and all you it back to step number one and all you got< got to do is just keep doing this so the got to do is just keep doing this so the whole< whole idea with this strategy is not to whole idea with this strategy is not to trade< trade it in a sense where you're just trade it in a sense where you're just trying< trying to capture you know profits here trying to capture you know profits here and< and there and hopefully try and avoid and there and hopefully try and avoid the< the losses when QQ make a loss so this the losses when QQ make a loss so this is< is not that strategy this strategy is not that strategy this strategy basically< basically is to mimic the performance of basically is to mimic the performance of QQQ< QQQ but using a leverage tool which is QQQ but using a leverage tool which is option< option so we're going to use the cpse to option so we're going to use the cpse to kind< kind of Leverage the returns that we get kind of Leverage the returns that we get on< on the QQQ so what that means also is on the QQQ so what that means also is that< that if I was to go back to this table that if I was to go back to this table over< over here to see the annual Total return over here to see the annual Total return for< for example if QQQ did 25. 5% in 2024 for example if QQQ did 25.

5% in 2024 what< what it means that with lips you should what it means that with lips. you should generally< generally get a higher return compared generally get a higher return compared to< to this 25. 5 % if you do it the right to this 25.

5 % if you do it the right way< way now same thing for 2023. so if QQQ way now same thing for 2023 so if QQQ did< did 54. 8 5% in 2023 with the lip did 54.

8 5% in 2023 with the lip strategy< strategy you can get a higher return now strategy you can get a higher return now one< one thing you need to know is that with one thing you need to know is that with this< this liap strategy you're actually this liap strategy you're actually enhancing< enhancing the performance of the enhancing the performance of the underlying< underlying so in this case if it's a underlying so in this case if it's a positive< positive you enhance the positive return positive you enhance the positive return but< but if it's a negative for example in but if it's a negative for example in 2022< 2022 you'll be enhancing the negative 2022 you'll be enhancing the negative returns< returns as well that means to say your returns as well that means to say your performance< performance using in 2022 will be worse performance using in 2022 will be worse than< than 32% so that means you'll be down than 32% so that means you'll be down maybe< maybe more than 32% so this is how the maybe more than 32% so this is how the call< call lips work or rather this lip call lips work or rather this lip strategy< strategy is meant to do it just enhances strategy is meant to do it just enhances the< the performance so that is why for the the performance so that is why for the lip< lip strategy which we're using you want lip strategy which we're using you want to< to use it on positive drift vehicle to use it on positive drift vehicle where< where you know that in the long term it where you know that in the long term it will< will want to just keep going higher if will want to just keep going higher if you< you use this on individual stocks then you use this on individual stocks then the< the risk really is on you because if the the risk really is on you because if the stock< stock actually do not go up over the stock actually do not go up over the long< long term it keeps going down then long term it keeps going down then you're< you're going to lose a lot of money all you're going to lose a lot of money all right< right so the next thing that I want to right so the next thing that I want to talk< talk about is this deep in the money uh talk about is this deep in the money uh call< call lip Dum here so deep in the money call lip Dum here so deep in the money how< how deep do we want it to be so when I how deep do we want it to be so when I talk<. talk about deep in the money I'm really talk about deep in the money I'm really talking< talking about somewhere around 90 deltas talking about somewhere around 90 deltas and< and that is because when you are buying and that is because when you are buying options< options you have a very big enemy you options you have a very big enemy you have< have a very big Nemesis and that is the have a very big Nemesis and that is the extrinsic< extrinsic value so when you are buying extrinsic value so when you are buying options< options this extrinsic value down here options this extrinsic value down here is< is your Kryptonite because as you can is your Kryptonite because as you can see< see over here this is the Delta of the see over here this is the Delta of the options< options so what you notice is that the options so what you notice is that the higher< higher the Delta the lower the extrinsic higher the Delta the lower the extrinsic value< value and the lower the Delta as you can value and the lower the Delta as you can see< see as I go to the lower Deltas you will see as I go to the lower Deltas you will see< see the extrinsic value finally pick up see the extrinsic value finally pick up so< so this extrinsic value down here this so this extrinsic value down here this whole< whole column here what it just means is whole column here what it just means is that< that whatever value you see here will go that whatever value you see here will go to< to zero once this option expires to zero once this option expires so< so the whole idea down here is that when so the whole idea down here is that when I< I buy the option I want to have as I buy the option I want to have as little< little extrinsic value in the option as little extrinsic value in the option as much< much as possible now this is the much as possible now this is the opposite< opposite when you're selling options opposite when you're selling options when< when you're selling options you want to when you're selling options you want to have< have as much extrinsic value as much as have as much extrinsic value as much as possible< possible but when you're buying options possible but when you're buying options is< is the opposite so when you go for deep is the opposite so when you go for deep in< in money for example 90 Deltas down here in money for example 90 Deltas down here you< you can see that the extrinsic value is you can see that the extrinsic value is about about about $20. 8< $20.

8 now if you were to compare this to $20. 8 now if you were to compare this to something< something that's at the money so let's something that's at the money so let's say< say for example if I was. to choose one say for example if I was to choose one down< down here let's say 60 Delta you notice down here let's say 60 Delta you notice that< 52.

38%< 52. 38% about $116,000 per option 52.

38% about $116,000 per option contract< contract because each contract controls contract because each contract controls 100< 100 shares so as you can see over here 100 shares so as you can see over here let's< let's say if the QQQ after the end of let's say if the QQQ after the end of the< the life of this option so as you can the life of this option so as you can see< see over here I chose about 373 days see over here I chose about 373 days what< what that means is that if QQQ do not what that means is that if QQQ do not move< move from its current price so as you move from its current price so as you can< can see the current price is about 515 can see the current price is about 515 as< as of this recording if it does not move as of this recording if it does not move from< from this price at expiration what is from this price at expiration what is the< the final value of this option well the the final value of this option well the final< final value is basically what you final value is basically what you purchase< purchase for minus of this extrinsic purchase for minus of this extrinsic value< value down here because extrinsic value value down here because extrinsic value goes< goes to zero but what remains is the goes to zero but what remains is the intrinsic< intrinsic value intrinsic value does not intrinsic value intrinsic value does not Decay< Decay so in this event whereby the Decay so in this event whereby the market< market did not move at all all you lost market did not move at all all you lost is is is $208< $208 out of the $164 47 that you bought $208 out of the $164 47 that you bought this< this call lip for now what about the add this call lip for now what about the add the< the money option the add the money the money option the add the money option< option would be slightly different option would be slightly different because< because right now we had bought this one because right now we had bought this one which< which is out of the money right as you which is out of the money right as you can< can see down here this line down here can see down here this line down here denotes< denotes whether it's in the money or out denotes whether it's in the money or out of< of the money so this option strike down of the money so this option strike down here< here is out of the money which means to here is out of the money which means to say< say once it reaches expiration all this say once it reaches expiration all this extrinsic< extrinsic value is all gone and because extrinsic value is all gone and because QQQ< QQQ did not move at all or rather it QQQ did not move at all or rather it went< went back to the same price at the end went back to the same price at the end of< of this life of this expiration of this of this life of this expiration of this uh< uh option basically your option is now uh option basically your option is now worthless< worthless so you have paid $53 for it worthless so you have paid $53 for it now< now it's zero so that is why whenever we now it's zero so that is why whenever we are< are buying call lips we always want to are buying call lips we always want to go< go as deep in the money as much as go as deep in the money as much as possible< possible in my case my comfort is to go possible in my case my comfort is to go very< very deep in the money now some people very deep in the money now some people have< have asked you know Davis can I go for have asked you know Davis can I go for not< not so deep in the money can I go for not so deep in the money can I go for something< something like 80 Delta can I go for something like 80 Delta can I go for something< something like 70 Delta yes you can and something like 70 Delta yes you can and there's< there's always a trade-off right the there's always a trade-off right the trade-off< trade-off is that firstly it will be trade-off is that firstly it will be cheaper< cheaper to purchase the option but you cheaper to purchase the option but you have< have a higher extren value which means have a higher extren value which means to< to say your option is going to worth to say your option is going to worth much< much less especially if QQQ does not much less especially if QQQ does not move< move at the end of expiration and as you move at the end of expiration and as you can< can see over here same thing as well can see over here same thing as well you're< you're going to lose $43 out of what you you're going to lose $43 out of what you purchase< purchase of this purchase of this $75< $75 so the whole idea down here of going $75 so the whole idea down here of going into< into this 90 Deltas is to reduce the into this 90 Deltas is to reduce the amount< amount of the extrinsic value Decay at amount of the extrinsic value Decay at expiration< expiration now let's get over to the expiration now let's get over to the second< second point so the second Point okay my second point so the second Point okay my uh< uh drawing is all gone down here but the uh drawing is all gone down here but the second< second Point down here is to roll once second Point down here is to roll once the< the DTE is roughly around 60 to 990 DTE the DTE is roughly around 60 to 990 DTE so< so why do I say to roll at 60 to 90t so so why do I say to roll at 60 to 90t so first< first of all rolling is just basically first of all rolling is just basically to< to continue the position so remember we to continue the position so remember we are< are just trying to simulate a buy and are just trying to simulate a buy and hold< hold of QQQ but we're using lips right hold of QQQ but we're using lips right we're< we're using lips options and because we're using lips options and because options< options has a very finite date where it options has a very finite date where it expires< expires we cannot just leave it all the expires we cannot just leave it all the way< way to exploration we want to roll it to way to exploration we want to roll it to continue< continue so I choose 60 to 90 DTE continue so I choose 60 to 90 DTE because< because that's the time roughly where because that's the time roughly where the< the Theta Decay starts to gradually the Theta Decay starts to gradually increase< increase even more as you know like I increase even more as you know like I mentioned< mentioned just now Theta Decay is mentioned just now Theta Decay is exponential< exponential so towards the last 45 days exponential so towards the last 45 days what< what you will find out is that the Theta what you will find out is that the Theta Decay< Decay really decays very quickly but if Decay really decays very quickly but if you< you go somewhere around 60 to 90 DTE the you go somewhere around 60 to 90 DTE the Decay< Decay is still acceptable so we want to Decay is still acceptable so we want to get< get out of this position and renew this get out of this position and renew this position< position back to the original uh position back to the original uh position< position again that means you bring it position again that means you bring it back< back all the way to more than one year back all the way to more than one year in< in terms of the expiration date so now in terms of the expiration date so now that< that I Shar with you this strategy you. that I Shar with you this strategy you might< might be curious how would this strategy might be curious how would this strategy have< have done over the past few years so how have done over the past few years so how do< do we know whether this strategy has do we know whether this strategy has been< been doing well over the past few years been doing well over the past few years well< well the simple way is simply to just well the simple way is simply to just back< back test it right so first of all you back test it right so first of all you need< need to realize that this strategy makes need to realize that this strategy makes sense< sense because it is just writing on the sense because it is just writing on the Cod< Cod tail of the performance of QQQ and Cod tail of the performance of QQQ and it< it just enhances it so at the end of the it just enhances it so at the end of the day< day if QQQ keeps going up and QQQ itself day if QQQ keeps going up and QQQ itself is< is profitable then it only makes sense is profitable then it only makes sense that< that this strategy is profitable that this strategy is profitable provided< provided you go according to the uh provided you go according to the uh mechanics< mechanics which I shared with you that mechanics which I shared with you that means< means deep in the money if you were to means deep in the money if you were to go< go one that at the money or even out the go one that at the money or even out the money< money then maybe there could be some money then maybe there could be some challenge< challenge because of the decay of the challenge because of the decay of the extrinsic< extrinsic value so let's first start off extrinsic value so let's first start off by< by testing out how this strategy by testing out how this strategy actually< actually did over the you know past few actually did over the you know past few years< years so as you can see over here this years so as you can see over here this is< is the back testing tool by tasty trade is the back testing tool by tasty trade and< and it's free to use if you have an and it's free to use if you have an account< account with tasty trade all you got to account with tasty trade all you got to do< do is go to the tab on the left hand do is go to the tab on the left hand side< side so this is the web platform just side so this is the web platform just have< have to click this uh uh icon over here have to click this uh uh icon over here that< that says back testing and it will bring that says back testing and it will bring you< you to this uh uh page over here so for you to this uh uh page over here so for this< this we're just going to choose long this we're just going to choose long call< call and make sure you can see this is call and make sure you can see this is QQQ< QQQ and interval I'm just going to test QQQ and interval I'm just going to test it< it for the past 12 months first and then it for the past 12 months first and then we< we will also see see after that you know we will also see see after that you know the< the past few years before this so over the past few years before this so over here< here we are just only going to trade one here we are just only going to trade one contract< contract continuously so what is the contract continuously so what is the results< results that you can get trading this results that you can get trading this strategy< strategy uh continuously just using one strategy uh continuously just using one contract< contract so over here as you know the contract so over here as you know the strike< strike we're going to go for about 90 strike we're going to go for about 90 deltas< deltas and expiration we want to go at deltas and expiration we want to go at least< least one year out so one year out I'm least one year out so one year out I'm just< just going to put 365 DTE because that just going to put 365 DTE because that just< just means the expiration date is just means the expiration date is 365< 365 days away which is about a year now 365 days away which is about a year now the< the whole idea down here is that we the whole idea down here is that we basically< basically do not want to get in and out basically do not want to get in and out too< too many times because if you get in and too many times because if you get in and out< out so many times firstly you will incur out so many times firstly you will incur the< the spread and as you know the spread the spread and as you know the spread for< for deep in the money options is not for deep in the money options is not that< that good because the spread of the bid that good because the spread of the bid and< and ass is going to be pretty wide so as and ass is going to be pretty wide so as much< much as possible we want to reduce the much as possible we want to reduce the transaction< transaction of this bid and ass so we transaction of this bid and ass so we only< only going to pretty much roll about only going to pretty much roll about once< once a year so this is going to be a once a year so this is going to be a semi-< semi- passive strategy right at least uh semi- passive strategy right at least uh slightly< slightly more active than a Buy and Hold slightly more active than a Buy and Hold but< but definitely much more passive than but definitely much more passive than the< the other selling option strategies that the other selling option strategies that I< I have on my channel so for this uh I'll I have on my channel so for this uh I'll just< just put everyday as default but I'm just put everyday as default but I'm going< going to limit the number of active going to limit the number of active trades< trades so as you can see I'm going to trades so as you can see I'm going to limit< limit to one and exit a specific DTE so limit to one and exit a specific DTE so I'm< I'm going to put at 90 DTE and the rest I'm going to put at 90 DTE and the rest I'm< I'm just going to uh not check this box I'm just going to uh not check this box down< down here just leave it as it is and down here just leave it as it is and then< then let's run the back test and let's then let's run the back test and let's just< just see how it's going to perform uh just see how it's going to perform uh for< for this one year by the way if you like for this one year by the way if you like this< this video so far Please Subscribe and this video so far Please

#### Topic 2

com blueprint all right back to< to the video so as you can see over here to the video so as you can see over here the< the results are out and based on the p&amp;l the results are out and based on the p&amp;l you< $7,650< $7,650 trade back testing tool they $7,650 trade back testing tool they actually< actually compare it if you had you know actually compare it if you had you know purchased< purchased the shares of the underlying purchased the shares of the underlying so< so in this case. QQ buy Ando is so in this case QQ buy Ando is $3,284< $3,284 so the total pnl is actually more $3,284 so the total pnl is actually more than< than double what you will get in buy and than double what you will get in buy and ho< ho and if we take a look at the return ho and if we take a look at the return on< on the use Capital you can see that the on the use Capital you can see that the return< return is return is 66. 3%< 66.

3% and this again is more double than 66. 3% and this again is more double than what< what you would get if you buy and hold what you would get if you buy and hold so< so as you can see this is what I mean it so as you can see this is what I mean it enhances< enhances the performance of the enhances the performance of the underlying< underlying so although it enhances the underlying so although it enhances the positive< positive. aspect of the return it also positive aspect of the return it also enhances< enhances the draw down so this is one enhances the draw down so this is one thing< thing to really pay attention to as well thing to really pay attention to as well as< as you can see over here the drawn on as you can see over here the drawn on for< for this strategy is for this strategy is 33.

3%< 33. 3% if you had Buy and Hold the QQQ 33.

3% if you had Buy and Hold the QQQ you< you will see that. the draw down is only you will see that the draw down is only 13. 5< 13.

5 6% and that means that the draw 13. 5 6% and that means that the draw down< down for Buy and Hold is less than half down for Buy and Hold is less than half of< of what you will get with lips so like I of what you will get with lips so like I mentioned< mentioned it magnifies it enhances the mentioned it magnifies it enhances the performance< performance so this is something you performance so this is something you really< really need to pay attention to although really need to pay attention to although the< the return is higher you also have a the return is higher you also have a bigger< bigger draw down so in a sense higher bigger draw down so in a sense higher risk< risk higher reward but not in terms of risk higher reward but not in terms of uh< uh absolute dollar for the capital that uh absolute dollar for the capital that you< you put in but rather because the you put in but rather because the capital< capital you put in is much smaller capital you put in is much smaller compared< compared to if you actually buy and compared to if you actually buy and whole< whole because your lips option is going whole because your lips option is going to< to be cheaper that is why your return is to be cheaper that is why your return is going< going to be magnified right either to going to be magnified right either to the< the upside or to the downside so this is the upside or to the downside so this is for< for onee return now let's take a look at for onee return now let's take a look at the< the past 5 years return and see how it the past 5 years return and see how it performs< performs so as you can. see the past 5 performs so as you can see the past 5 years< years so this would actually go back to years so this would actually go back to the< the pandemic time at 2020 and also to the pandemic time at 2020 and also to the< the 2022 uh bare market so let's just the 2022 uh bare market so let's just see< see how this actually performs so let's see how this actually performs so let's run< run a back test over here run a back test over here and< and just let this back test load okay as and just let this back test load okay as you< you can see over here the total profit you can see over here the total profit and< and loss again it's uh much higher than and loss again it's uh much higher than if< if you do Buy and Hold and the return is if you do Buy and Hold and the return is higher< higher as well now this time it's not as higher as well now this time it's not as great< great as compared to one year return great as compared to one year return which< which you just saw just now but it's which you just saw just now but it's still< still higher right because if you buy still higher right because if you buy and< and hold it's about 140% but if you use and hold it's about 140% but if you use leaps< leaps it's leaps it's 197%< 197% now over here another thing again 197% now over here another thing again to< to take note you can see that the drawn to take note you can see that the drawn out< out also is higher Buy and Hold Your out also is higher Buy and Hold Your draw< draw down is about 35.

6 2% but for lips draw down is about 35. 6 2% but for lips is< is about is about 48.

75< 48. 75 per.

so now let's go a little bit 48. 75 per.

so now let's go a little bit deeper< deeper and see the details of the deeper and see the details of the transaction< transaction so this is one of the beauty transaction so this is one of the beauty that< that uh this back testing tool has is that uh this back testing tool has is that< that you can actually take a look at that you can actually take a look at some< some of this details uh on this uh whole some of this details uh on this uh whole strategy< strategy for the past 5 years so one strategy for the past 5 years so one thing< thing you will note is that there are thing you will note is that there are very< very few trades and it's designed to be very few trades and it's designed to be this< this way as you can see there are only this way as you can see there are only six< six trades over the past 5 years because six trades over the past 5 years because we< we put the DTs 365 and we exit somewhere we put the DTs 365 and we exit somewhere around< around 90 DT where we roll it to you around 90 DT where we roll it to you know< know the back to step one again like I know the back to step one again like I mentioned< mentioned so there's not many uh trads mentioned so there's not many uh trads that< that we put on and this is what we want that we put on and this is what we want as< as well. because again this is meant to as well because again this is meant to be< be a replacement for a Buy and Hold but be a replacement for a Buy and Hold but a< a leverage way of uh doing it so you a leverage way of uh doing it so you will< will see that there are six trades in will see that there are six trades in total< total four of them are in profit and total four of them are in profit and this< this one is in a loss two in loss this this one is in a loss two in loss this one< one is in a slight loss so what you one is in a slight loss so what you notice< notice is that this profits down here notice is that this profits down here and< and the losses kind of already mimics and the losses kind of already mimics the< the actual return of QQQ because this the actual return of QQQ because this loss< loss down here is sustained actually loss down here is sustained actually during< during the bare Market in 2022 now 2020 during the bare Market in 2022 now 2020 is< is overall a positive because QQ is overall a positive because QQ actually< actually was positive in 2020 so if I actually was positive in 2020 so if I was< was to go back to this table over here was to go back to this table over here you< you can see right in 20 20 QQ actually you can see right in 20 20 QQ actually had< had a return of 48. 62 per.

#### Topic 3

so it was had a return of 48. 62 per.

so it was positive< positive but 2022 it was a loss so over positive but 2022 it was a loss so over the< the five years basically you have four the five years basically you have four winning< winning years and one losing year and winning years and one losing year and this< this is exactly the same with this this is exactly the same with this strategy< strategy as well pretty much you have strategy as well pretty much you have four< four winning years and one losing year four winning years and one losing year now< now there's one other thing that I need now there's one other thing that I need to< to point you out to when you're trading to point you out to when you're trading this< this lip strategy and that is that the this lip strategy and that is that the capital< capital when you first put up into this capital when you first put up into this strategy< strategy you may need to top up when you strategy you may need to top up when you actually< actually roll it again if it's a loss so actually roll it again if it's a loss so let< let me just show you what I mean so if let me just show you what I mean so if you< you were to go to the locks tab over you were to go to the locks tab over here< here you will be able to see all the here you will be able to see all the trades< trades that uh was placed and what it trades that uh was placed and what it was< was uh closed out for so as you can see was uh closed out for so as you can see over< over here the premium at this date when over here the premium at this date when you< you bought the 90 Delta it cost you you bought the 90 Delta it cost you about about about $5,850< $5,850 to put this trade on so on this $5,850 to put this trade on so on this trade< trade itself it was a profit of trade itself it was a profit of $573< $573 so that means to say now your $573 so that means to say now your capital< capital is this uh sum of this two capital is this uh sum of this two amount< amount so 5,800 plus 5,700 you have amount so 5,800 plus 5,700 you have roughly< roughly over roughly over $111,000< $111,000 now all of the $111,000 for the $111,000 now all of the $111,000 for the next< next trade you need to put up next trade you need to put up $8,800< $8,800 as you can see over here so $8,800 as you can see over here so $8,800< $8,800 and then you make another $7,400 $8,800 and then you make another $7,400 that< that makes the sum and then the next one that makes the sum and then the next one you< you put uh this amount now this is all you put uh this amount now this is all good< good if you start off with winning GE good if you start off with winning GE that< that means most likely you do not even that means most likely you do not even have< have to out additional Capital to have to out additional Capital to sustain< sustain this position when you roll but sustain this position when you roll but what< what if the very first year which you what if the very first year which you put< put on is going to be a loss for example put on is going to be a loss for example let's< let's say the fourth trade happens to be let's say the fourth trade happens to be the< the very first trade that you put on all the very first trade that you put on all right< right so let's just uh remove this first right so let's just uh remove this first three< three trades assuming it never happened three trades assuming it never happened and< and your very first trade is that you and your very first trade is that you paid< paid $11,100 paid $11,100 for< for this trade for this uh cpse now at for this trade for this uh cpse now at the< the end of this trade when you're about the end of this trade when you're about to< to roll what you realize is that you are to roll what you realize is that you are down< down about $9,000 over dollars which down about $9,000 over dollars which means< means to say of this 11,000 which you means to say of this 11,000 which you put< put up you only left roughly $2,000 but put up you only left roughly $2,000 but what< what you notice for the next trade when what you notice for the next trade when you< you roll because now we need to roll you roll because now we need to roll back< back to the 90 Deltas again you need to back to the 90 Deltas again you need to have< have more Capital this time as you can have more Capital this time as you can see< see over here it cost you see over here it cost you $9,200< $9,200 for you to put up this new $9,200 for you to put up this new position< position when you roll but you already position when you roll but you already only< only have 2,000 left from this uh only have 2,000 left from this uh original< original 11,000 you put up because you original 11,000 you put up because you lost< lost about $99,000 so what that means is lost about $99,000 so what that means is that< that your Capital have left 2K you need that your Capital have left 2K you need to< to top up roughly about to top up roughly about $7,000< $7,000 to put up this position so do you $7,000 to put. up this position so do you see< see this is one of the cons of putting see this is one of the cons of putting up< up this lip strategy so it's not like up this lip strategy so it's not like you< you put up one time and you think that you put up one time and you think that based< based on this Capital you can always based on this Capital you can always keep< keep making more from there it's not keep making more from there it's not necessarily< necessarily true right for Buy and Hold necessarily true right for Buy and Hold probably< probably so because if you just pay the probably so because if you just pay the full< full amount for the share itself if full amount for the share itself if there's< there's a draw down all you got to do is there's a draw down all you got to do is just< just hold on to it and you just wait for just hold on to it and you just wait for it< it to eventually go back up again so it to eventually go back up again so there's< there's no need for you to pump New there's no need for you to pump New Capital< Capital into the trade but because Capital into the trade but because you're< you're using lips lips is a leverage you're using lips lips is a leverage tool< tool so this is where you might actually tool so this is where you might actually have< have to top up your Capital if the first have to top up your Capital if the first year< year is a loss and let's say for example year is a loss and let's say for example if< if you are a little bit unfortunate and if you are a little bit unfortunate and you< you reach the point whereby there there you reach the point whereby there there are< are multiple losses in a row as you can are multiple losses in a row as you can see< see over here this is three years of see over here this is three years of losses< losses which means to say you're going losses which means to say you're going to< to have three losing trades you need to to have three losing trades you need to top< top up each time whenever you roll to top up each time whenever you roll to the< the uh step one again so this is the uh step one again so this is something< something very important to take note something very important to take note when< when you're trading the lip strategy now when you're trading the lip strategy now one< one last thing I want to touch on is one last thing I want to touch on is what< what if you do not actually have you what if you do not actually have you know< know enough Capital to put on one of know enough Capital to put on one of this< this uh 90 Deltas uh call lip down here this uh 90 Deltas uh call lip down here as< as you can see for this 90 Delta callip as you can see for this 90 Delta callip based< based off of 373 DTE is going to cost based off of 373 DTE is going to cost you< you about you about $116,000< $116,000 for you to put it on and as you $116,000 for you to put it on and as you know< know if this year let's say for example know if this year let's say for example is< is going to be a loss it means to say is going to be a loss it means to say the< the next time you roll this you need to the next time you roll this you need to add< add Capital again so what can you do if add Capital again so what can you do if you< you don't have that big of a capital you don't have that big of a capital then< then this is where you might want to then this is where you might want to consider< consider the cheaper version of QQQ so consider the cheaper version of QQQ so the< the cheaper version of QQQ would be the the cheaper version of QQQ would be the index< index ETF called xlk so xlk is also an index ETF called xlk so xlk is also an index< index ETF but the price is much smaller index ETF but the price is much smaller so< so if I was to go to xlk over here let so if I was to go to xlk over here let me< me just remove all these drawings and if me just remove all these drawings and if we< we were to go all the way to the uh 373 we were to go all the way to the uh 373 days< days as well you can see over here one days as well you can see over here one contract< contract of the cpse at around 90 Delta contract of the cpse at around 90 Delta for< for xlk is around for xlk is around $8,250< $8,250 which is around half of what you $8,250 which is around half of what you would< would have to F out for QQQ so if you would have to F out for QQQ so if you have< have a smaller Capital size you can have a smaller Capital size you can consider< consider using xlk for this lip strategy consider using xlk for this lip strategy all< all right so I hope you found this video all right so I hope you found this video helpful< helpful if you have please give me a helpful if you have please give me

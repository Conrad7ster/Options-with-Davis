execute the trades in a sense where they execute the trades but< but they are not the one that actually but they are not the one that actually makes< makes the decision to buy or sell rather makes the decision to buy or sell rather they< they are just there to recommend trades they are just there to recommend trades right< right maybe the institutions have told right maybe the institutions have told them< them to to recommend or push certain them to to recommend or push certain stocks< stocks to their clients so that's what stocks to their clients so that's what they're< they're doing right so they will have to they're doing right so they will have to call< call the clients whether it be retail call the clients whether it be retail investors< investors or institutions so that's why investors or institutions so that's why there's< there's the need for them to speak on there's the need for them to speak on the< the phone so the way they make money is the phone so the way they make money is not< not through trading the markets but not through trading the markets but rather< rather through the commissions where rather through the commissions where each< each trade or each time when they they each trade or each time when they they get< get their clients to buy something right get their clients to buy something right there's< there's a commission and they get a there's a commission and they get a commission< commission share at the same time they commission share at the same time they get< get salary or some commission sharing as get salary or some commission sharing as well< well right so the proprietary Trader is well right so the proprietary Trader is very< very different right there there's no very different right there there's no commission< commission that's being paid to them commission that's being paid to them because< because they are trading the markets for because they are trading the markets for profits< profits right the only way they make profits right the only way they make money< money is if they are profitable in the money is if they are profitable in the markets< markets whereas for this group people markets whereas for this group people here< here how good they are whether they make here how good they are whether they make money< money depends on their sales volume now money depends on their sales volume now what< what is a proprietary Trader so if you what is a proprietary Trader so if you are< are not familiar with the term are not familiar with the term proprietary< proprietary Trader so basically proprietary Trader so basically proprietary< proprietary Traders are professional proprietary Traders are professional traders< traders who trade for a living and they traders who trade for a living and they work< work for a proprietary trading firm work for a proprietary trading firm right< right so basically proprietary trading right so basically proprietary trading forms< forms also known as problems there are forms also known as problems there are institutions< institutions right but they are not as institutions right but they are not as big< big as Banks but there are institutions big as Banks but there are institutions where< where they have their own money uh this where they have their own money uh this money< money could be gotten from you know money could be gotten from you know investors< investors or it could be the founders investors or it could be the founders own< own money right so it could be either of own money right so it could be either of them< them and then they will hire traders to them and then they will hire traders to trade< trade their accounts so they will have trade their accounts so they will have many< many different accounts for each of many different accounts for each of these< these traders to trade right so what are these traders to trade right so what are the< the products that prop Traders trade so the products that prop Traders trade so the< the products that the pop Traders trade the products that the pop Traders trade comes< comes down also to what kind of problem comes down also to what kind of problem it< it is and there are a few different it is and there are a few different kinds< kinds there is the equity platform where kinds there is the equity platform where they< they mainly trade equities then you have they mainly trade equities then you have the< the Futures platform as well where they the Futures platform as well where they mainly< mainly trade Futures there are many mainly trade Futures there are many different< different Futures currency bonds different Futures currency bonds Commodities< Commodities interest rates the index as Commodities interest rates the index as well< well and then you have also the Forex well and then you have also the Forex prop< prop trading companies and also recently prop trading companies and also recently uh< uh they are crypto right back then in my uh they are crypto right back then in my time< time there there is no crypto prop form time there there is no crypto prop form I< I have not heard of them so I have been I have not heard of them so I have been on< on the equities and the future steps on the equities and the future steps before< before so my experience is in this two before so my experience is in this two areas< areas so how do prop Traders get paid areas so how do prop Traders get paid right< right so their remuneration so there are right so their remuneration so there are basically< basically two types of uh payout basically two types of uh payout schedule< schedule that I know of so number one is schedule that I know of so number one is with< with a small salary plus profit sharing with a small salary plus profit sharing right< right or just purely profit sharing that right or just purely profit sharing that means< means you do not get any salary means you do not get any salary whatsoever< whatsoever so if you're going for a whatsoever so if you're going for a small< small salary plus profit sharing usually small salary plus profit sharing usually your< your profit sharing is pretty small your profit sharing is pretty small right< right is definitely less than 50 and right is definitely less than 50 and then< then you have at least a fixed salary then you have at least a fixed salary every< every month but this fixed salary is not every month but this fixed salary is not a< a lot and then you have profit sharing a lot and then you have profit sharing as< as well as well if< if you take purely profit sharing then if you take purely profit sharing then you< you will have a bigger share so you will have a bigger share so sometimes< sometimes it could come in tier level so sometimes it could come in tier level so for< for example if you made certain amount for example if you made certain amount you< you get a certain amount of profit you get a certain amount of profit sharing< sharing and it also very much differs sharing and it also very much differs from< from firm to firm right certain firms from firm to firm right certain firms will< will pay pay their Traders more they will pay pay their Traders more they will< will have a bigger profit share but will have a bigger profit share but usually< usually the profit share at most if I'm usually the profit share at most if I'm not< not wrong should be 50 right that was not wrong should be 50 right that was the< the the one that I was getting when I the the one that I was getting when I was< was at the prop firm now if you are at a was at the prop firm now if you are at a good< good proper prop firm they will never good proper prop firm they will never ask< ask you to put in your own money right ask you to put in your own money right so< so I've heard of some platforms where so I've heard of some platforms where you< you know they will interview you and you know they will interview you and they< they say that if you're doing if you did they say that if you're doing if you did well< well they will let you trade the account well they will let you trade the account but< but you have to put up some of your own but you have to put up some of your own money< money as well so they say that the risk money as well so they say that the risk is< is equal right now normally good is equal right now normally good problems< problems do not do that if a problem is problems do not do that if a problem is asking< asking you for money there's a reflect asking you for money there's a reflect you< you might want to do more research first you might want to do more research first because< because most of the time they will only because most of the time they will only reach< reach their own money so in a sense reach their own money so in a sense there< there should be no risk to you okay so there should be no risk to you okay so what< what strategies do proprietary Traders what strategies do proprietary Traders trade< trade so in my stint there I can tell trade so in my stint there I can tell you< you that the proprietary Traders you that the proprietary Traders actually< actually trade high probability trades actually trade high probability trades right< right that means you actually make right that means you actually make consistent< consistent small profits and then the consistent small profits and then the occasional< occasional big losses and these traits occasional big losses and these traits are< are not like what you would read in are not like what you would read in those< those books like Trend trading or learn those books like Trend trading or learn all< all those chart patterns and all that all those chart patterns and all that stuff< stuff those are more directional trading stuff those are more directional trading right< right proprietary Traders or at least right proprietary Traders or at least the< the experience which I have with my the experience which I have with my proprietary< proprietary trading firms that I've been proprietary trading firms that I've been working< working for they don't really go for working for they don't really go for directional< directional trading because directional directional trading because directional training< training is actually very tough there's training is actually very tough there's no< no real Edge there other than the fact no real Edge there other than the fact that< that you have to be a good Trader right that you have to be a good Trader right whereas< whereas for proposing trading firms they whereas for proposing trading firms they generally< generally find an edge in terms of the generally find an edge in terms of the the< the mechanics and the strategies itself the mechanics and the strategies itself so< so there are basically two types of so there are basically two types of strategies< strategies at least at the platforms strategies at least at the platforms which< which I was at they were employing so which I was at they were employing so number< number one is spreading so it's pretty number one is spreading so it's pretty similar< similar with options whereby you know similar with options whereby you know you< you have spreads right you would sell you have spreads right you would sell one< one option and you would buy one option one option and you would buy. one option right< right so for this what they would do is right so for this what they would do is they'll< they'll be spreading so this is for the they'll be spreading so this is for the future< future Stacks basically they'll be future Stacks basically they'll be spreading< spreading two very high correlated uh spreading two very high correlated uh instruments< instruments right so you can see this instruments right so you can see this screen< screen down here you can see this is screen down here you can see this is what< what you call a leather right this is a what you call a leather right this is a leather< leather this is called TT the platform leather this is called TT the platform is< is called TT so basically they'll be is called TT so basically they'll be putting< putting the orders down here so putting the orders down here so what< what spreading involves is two highly what spreading involves is two highly core< core related instruments where they tend core related instruments where they tend to< to move together most of the time and to move together most of the time and then< then what they do is they Define then what they do is they Define deviation< deviation so there'll be certain times deviation so there'll be certain times where< where one of the instruments will move where one of the instruments will move away< away from each other right so for away from each other right so for example< example if this is uh instrument a example if this is uh instrument a instrument< instrument B instrument B so< so let's say for example most of the so let's say for example most of the time< time they will move together like this time they will move together like this so< so they move in tandem then all of a so they move in tandem then all of a sudden< sudden maybe at one time this will start sudden maybe at one time this will start to< to move up then this would maybe stay to move up then this would maybe stay still< still or start to move down so this is still or start to move down so this is where< where there is a little bit of a where there is a little bit of a discrete< discrete discrepancy so this discrepancy discrete discrepancy so this discrepancy is< is where they will start to enter into is where they will start to enter into the< the trades right this is called the trades right this is called spreading< spreading so what they'll do is they spreading so what they'll do is they will< will sell this one and then they will will sell this one and then they will buy< buy this one so what they are basically buy this one so what they are basically trying< trying to do is to Min revert the spread trying to do is to Min revert the spread because< because eventually the spread in the because eventually the spread in the long< long term should revert back and then long term should revert back and then they< they start to move in tandem again so they start to move in tandem again so they're< they're trying to find these small they're trying to find these small little< little edges to to make money right so little edges to to make money right so this< this is what basically they'll be doing this is what basically they'll be doing in< in and out so this is a high probably in and out so this is a high probably trading< trading style because a lot of times trading style because a lot of times right< right this movements this small right this movements this small discrepancy< discrepancy when they start to tend to discrepancy when they start to tend to move< move away from each other and then they move away from each other and then they trade< trade on both sides it will converge trade on both sides it will converge back< back so once it converts back that's back so once it converts back that's where< where they make the money they get out where they make the money they get out of< of the trade but there will be times of the trade but there will be times where< where the Divergence right will be very where the Divergence right will be very big< big right this is what you call the big right this is what you call the spread< spread will start to tear so they miss spread will start to tear so they miss the< the market for a all right may go all the market for a all right may go all the< the way up and then for B will start to the way up and then for B will start to continue< continue going down so the spread will continue going down so the spread will get< get wider and wider and then they will get wider and wider and then they will start< start to lose even more money so this is start to lose even more money so this is where< where you have the occasional big losses where you have the occasional big losses that's< that's when the spreads start to tear that's when the spreads start to tear but< but for most part for the most of the but for most part for the most of the time< time it is a very high probably trading time it is a very high probably trading strategy< strategy and if you think about it it's strategy and if you think about it it's very< very similar to selling Primo when we're very similar to selling Primo when we're trading< trading options because again it's the trading options because again it's the same< same thing when we're selling premiums same thing when we're selling premiums right< right when you're trading out of the right when you're trading out of the money< money options you are basically getting money options you are basically getting small< small profits relative to the losses small profits relative to the losses that< that you could make right these are that you could make right these are occasional< occasional big losses so the mindset occasional big losses so the mindset that< that some people have is that you know that some people have is that you know this< this is so dangerous because you are this is so dangerous because you are like< like picking nickels or what you call like picking nickels or what you call that< that picking coins nickels in front of a that picking coins nickels in front of a railway< railway track right you have smaller railway track right you have smaller wins< wins but then when the train come you're wins but then when the train come you're going< going to get wiped out now this is true going to get wiped out now this is true if< if you do not know how to manage your if you do not know how to manage your money< money well right if you know how to money well right if you know how to manage< manage your risk properly that's how you manage your risk properly that's how you can< can get wiped out but at the end of the can get wiped out but at the end of the day< day if you were to manage your trades day if you were to manage your trades well< well this is actually very profitable well this is actually very profitable right< right this is profitable otherwise why right this is profitable otherwise why would< would prop form still be around right would prop form still be around right because< because their strategies work right it's because their strategies work right it's very< very small wins and then the occasional very small wins and then the occasional big< big loss at the end of day as long as a big loss at the end of day as long as a positive< positive expectancy you will still make positive expectancy you will still make money< money the other way which they did will money the other way which they did will be< be day trading and scalping basically be day trading and scalping basically scalp< scalp the building aspect again it is a scalp the building aspect again it is a very< very very high probability trade and very very high probability trade and then< then you have the occasional big losses then you have the occasional big losses so< so if you are interested to know how so if you are interested to know how they< they actually trade I can just give you they actually trade I can just give you an< an insight an insight right< right so let me try and remember as much right so let me try and remember as much as< as I can remember this is 13 years ago as I can remember this is 13 years ago all< all right so basically what they'll do all right so basically what they'll do is< is they will sculpt the bid and aspect is they will sculpt the bid and aspect I'm< I'm pretty sure you've heard that before I'm pretty sure you've heard that before so< so this is pretty much a little bit like so this is pretty much a little bit like a< a market maker trading style right all a market maker trading style right all you're< you're doing is just make that one cent you're doing is just make that one cent one< one cent each time and you'll be one cent each time and you'll be surprised< surprised you know you might be thinking surprised you know you might be thinking you< you know one cent what what can you make you know one cent what what can you make with< with just one cent but actually you can with just one cent but actually you can make< make quite a bit right because the make quite a bit right because the orders< orders are pretty big to be ten thousand orders are pretty big to be ten thousand a< a hundred thousand right so a hundred a hundred thousand right so a hundred thousand< thousand of one cent can be pretty good thousand of one cent can be pretty good so< so that is a a pretty good decent amount so that is a a pretty good decent amount of< of money and this happens in a matter of of money and this happens in a matter of seconds< seconds or even minutes right so they'll seconds or even minutes right so they'll be< be in and out throughout the whole day be in and out throughout the whole day okay< okay so how do they actually trade I'll okay so how do they actually trade I'll just< just give you a rough idea okay so just give you a rough idea okay so basically< basically you can see this is the bid basically you can see this is the bid and< and R spread of a stock so basically and R spread of a stock so basically they< they will find those cheap stocks they will find those cheap stocks generally< generally under a dollar penny stocks or generally under a dollar penny stocks or something< something like that with very very high something like that with very very high volume< volume right so you you can see that volume right so you you can see that there's< there's quite a bit of volume sound then there's quite a bit of volume sound then can< can go up to a million shares so each can go up to a million shares so each each< each number down here basically this each number down here basically this means< means there's 85 000 shares down here means there's 85 000 shares down here on< on Q so then you have your own orders on Q so then you have your own orders right< right so these are all all your orders right so these are all all your orders on< on the bid that means you are buying the on the bid that means you are buying the shares< shares at this price and these are all shares at this price and these are all your< your orders on the offer right or the US your orders on the offer right or the US where< where you are selling the shares all where you are selling the shares all right< right so basically uh these are limit right so basically uh these are limit orders< orders these are Market orders these are orders these are Market orders these are limit< limit orders and you can see you're on limit orders and you can see you're on both< both sides of the market at the time so both sides of the market at the time so the< the whole idea down here is that you the whole idea down here is that you want< want to just beat the queue system so if want to just beat the queue system so if you're< you're not familiar with how the order you're not familiar with how the order entry< entry actually works so you can see down entry actually works so you can see down here< here there is 99 284 shares right so if here there is 99 284 shares right so if you< you were to put in 10 shares down here you were to put in 10 shares down here let's< let's say you are the last person to let's say you are the last person to make< make up this 99 make up this 99 284< 284 shares it means you're right at the 284 shares it means you're right at the bottom< bottom so that means there are 89 000 bottom so that means there are 89 000 plus< plus shares on top of you right so let's plus shares on top of you right so let's say< say for example the first person may say for example the first person may have< have 20 000 shares the next person have have 20 000 shares the next person have 10< 10 000 shares and so on and so forth 10 000 shares and so on and so forth until< until it's your turn you're at the until it's your turn you're at the bottom< bottom of the food chain right you have bottom of the food chain right you have 10< 10 000 shares so what will happen is 10 000 shares so what will happen is that< that whenever there is any order as is that whenever there is any order as is taken< taken out that means if there are some taken out that means if there are some people< people that actually hit the bid people that actually hit the bid right< right that means there are traders that right that means there are traders that want< want to sell their their stocks they want to sell their their stocks they will< will hit the bid they will sell a dollar will hit the bid they will sell a dollar so< so once they hit this bid they sell it so once they hit this bid they sell it it< it will come to the first person here so it will come to the first person here so let's< let's say the person who wants to sell let's say the person who wants to sell their< their shares they want to sell 10 000 their shares they want to sell 10 000 shares< shares right so they will sell 10 000 shares right so they will sell 10 000 and< and they will hit the bit at a dollar so and they will hit the bit at a dollar so they< they are out at one dollars for 10 000 they are out at one dollars for 10 000 shares< shares and then for this first person he shares and then for this first person he wants< wants to buy 20 000 shares at a dollar wants to buy 20 000 shares at a dollar so< so what will happen is that he will have so what will happen is that he will have 10< 10 000 shares filled he will have 10 000 10 000 shares filled he will have 10 000 shares shares shares all< all right so you do not get any shares all right so you do not get any shares because< because you are at the bottom of the because you are at the bottom of the food< food chain right you are still queuing food chain right you are still queuing for< for your chance to get uh hit or to get for your chance to get uh hit or to get a< a fuel at one dollar right so as the a fuel at one dollar right so as the days< days goes by right there will be more days goes by right there will be more people< people queuing behind you right you people queuing behind you right you you'll< you'll be queuing more people queuing so you'll be queuing more people queuing so slowly< slowly you will make your way up until slowly you will make your way up until you're< you're first in line in this queue right you're first in line in this queue right so< so when it's finally your turn in the so when it's finally your turn in the queue< queue right maybe at this time on the queue right maybe at this time on the right< right hand side you are also the first right hand side you are also the first person< person in the queue as well so what will person in the queue as well so what will happen< happen is that you will immediately buy happen is that you will immediately buy and< and then immediately get taken out sell and then immediately get taken out sell very< very quickly so you make that one cent very quickly so you make that one cent you're< you're out of the market right you're out of the market right so< so this is how pretty much they treat so so this is how pretty much they treat so what< what they are really doing is that what they are really doing is that they're< they're just trying to find themselves they're just trying to find themselves at< at the front of the queue so you can see at the front of the queue so you can see down< down here that there are 104 000 you down here that there are 104 000 you want< want to know how which is your position want to know how which is your position in< in the queue now of course just by in the queue now of course just by looking< looking at this you aren't able to see looking at this you aren't able to see so< so okay this is what you call the so okay this is what you call the different< different levels right the inside bit different levels right the inside bit and< and us this down here is called level and us this down here is called level one< one right level one you are able to see one right level one you are able to see the< the volume just for the inside bit and the volume just for the inside bit and over< over this is level one level two is this over this is level one level two is this whole< whole thing down here that means you are whole thing down here that means you are able< able to see the volume able to see the volume and< and it'll be an aspect for all the other and it'll be an aspect for all the other levels< levels so this is called level two codes levels so this is called level two codes and< and then there's actually One More Level and then there's actually One More Level which< which is called level three chords so which is called level three chords so level< level three chords are basically this level three chords are basically this you< you are able to see the Q order the you are able to see the Q order the packing< packing order to see where you are in packing order to see where you are in the< the queue right so if you are all the the queue right so if you are all the way< way at the bottom then you know that you way at the bottom then you know that you are< are not going to get filled very quickly are not going to get filled very quickly at< at all but if you're the first in queue at all but if you're the first in queue and< and there are many people lining up and there are many people lining up behind< behind you then guess what you have a behind you then guess what you have a very< very good chance to get fuel and then very good chance to get fuel and then also< also get filled on your order on the ask also get filled on your order on the ask side< side as well to make this uh one cent side as well to make this uh one cent scalp< scalp right now here is where the risk scalp right now here is where the risk is< is right you have to manage this very is right you have to manage this very well< well the risk is that there is a lot of well the risk is that there is a lot of manipulation< manipulation the manipulation right so manipulation the manipulation right so let< let me just remove some of these joints let me just remove some of these joints to< to make it very clear first so here's to make it very clear first so here's the< the manipulation right you might be the manipulation right you might be let's< let's say the last person down here okay let's say the last person down here okay let's< let's just say you are this last person let's just say you are this last person down< down here 10 000. so what will happen is down here 10 000.

so what will happen is that< that if all of a sudden that if all of a sudden somebody< somebody down here they decide not to somebody down here they decide not to get< get their shares filled they could pull get their shares filled they could pull all< all their shares away and all of a all their shares away and all of a sudden< sudden instead of uh being a buyer sudden instead of uh being a buyer there's< there's one guy who decides to sell all there's one guy who decides to sell all the< the way down so they will hit a hundred the way down so they will hit a hundred thousand< thousand shares on the bid and all of a thousand shares on the bid and all of a sudden< sudden you'll get filled on all this so sudden you'll get filled on all this so this< this is how price moves right. the price this is how price moves right the price moves< moves when there's no longer any buyer moves when there's no longer any buyer on< on the bid on the bid so< so all of a sudden 100 000 will sweep so all of a sudden 100 000 will sweep all< all these orders and all of a sudden now all these orders and all of a sudden now it< it will become offer so what happens now it will become offer so what happens now 96< 96 cents will now be on the offer and 96 cents will now be on the offer and the< the inside beat will now be 95 cents so the inside beat will now be 95 cents so this< this is where you are in trouble because this is where you are in trouble because you< you got all these orders got filled at you got all these orders got filled at 1. 996< 1.

996 and then now the current price is 1. 996 and then now the current price is 95< 95 cents and 96 cents offer so you are 95 cents and 96 cents offer so you are caught< caught in a position and you're losing caught in a position and you're losing money< money and the ship is sinking really money and the ship is sinking really fast< fast because if there's more people that fast because if there's more people that see< see this selling and all of a sudden see this selling and all of a sudden they< they also pull their bids that means they also pull their bids that means there< there is suddenly nobody wanting to there is suddenly nobody wanting to support< support the level down here and there support the level down here and there are< are more people starting to sell it are more people starting to sell it because< because they're afraid the market is because they're afraid the market is going< going to go further down then guess what going to go further down then guess what you'll< you'll be pushed even further and here's you'll be pushed even further and here's the< the thing with proprietary Traders right the thing with proprietary Traders right they< they don't really place any stop loss in they don't really place any stop loss in fact< fact there's no hard physical stop loss fact there's no hard physical stop loss they< they use Mental stop loss so when you they use Mental stop loss so when you have< have a mental stop loss it all comes have a mental stop loss it all comes down< down to your own discipline whether you down to your own discipline whether you can< can get out of the trade or not if you can get out of the trade or not if you can't< can't get out of the trade in time then can't get out of the trade in time then you're< you're going to lose a lot of money and you're going to lose a lot of money and that's< that's where you're going to get into that's where you're going to get into trouble< trouble all right so this is basically trouble all right so this is basically how< how proprietary Traders trade so the how proprietary Traders trade so the takeaway< takeaway is that it's actually High takeaway is that it's actually High property< property trades that you get consistent property trades that you get consistent small< small profits and then the occasional small profits and then the occasional big< big losses and what you really need to big losses and what you really need to manage< manage is Big losses and this brings me manage is Big losses and this brings me to< to my next Point by the way if this to my next Point by the way if this video< video has been helpful so far I'd video has been helpful so far I'd appreciate< appreciate if you hit the thumbs up appreciate if you hit the thumbs up button< button and also subscribe to my channel button and also subscribe to my channel so< so I can create more videos like this so I can create more videos like this for< for you in the future okay back to the for you in the future okay back to the video< video which is the props firm's primary video which is the props firm's primary focus< focus and that is on risk management focus and that is on risk management right< right Bridge management is very right Bridge management is very important< important so managing risk is the key important so managing risk is the key focus< focus of prop funds because they want to focus of prop funds because they want to ensure< ensure that no one single Trader will ensure that no one single Trader will wipe< wipe them out you see all these Traders wipe them out you see all these Traders down< down here one of them will be inevitably down here one of them will be inevitably The< The Joker right not necessarily this The Joker right not necessarily this person< person but this person is going to lose person but this person is going to lose you< you a lot of money because it's not you a lot of money because it's not going< going to be disciplined and he's going going to be disciplined and he's going to< to cause a lot of loss for the firm so to cause a lot of loss for the firm so what< what the firms actually employ is what the firms actually employ is actually< actually a maximum loss for the day actually a maximum loss for the day right< right for each Trader depending on their right for each Trader depending on their size< size and their trading ability right so size and their trading ability right so newer< newer Traders generally have a much newer Traders generally have a much smaller< smaller risk tolerance risk limit that smaller risk tolerance risk limit that means< means let's say if they lose a certain means let's say if they lose a certain amount< amount for the day the problem will tell amount for the day the problem will tell them< them to stop their trading for the day them to stop their trading for the day right< right they cannot trade so they would right they cannot trade so they would have< have to close out all their position if have to close out all their position if you< you are a senior Trader or you're more you are a senior Trader or you're more profitable< profitable you have a bigger size then profitable you have a bigger size then you< you have a bigger risk limit right so you have a bigger risk limit right so interestingly< interestingly enough and ironically most interestingly enough and ironically most prop< prop Traders aren't good at managing prop Traders aren't good at managing their< their own risk right you see most of the their own risk right you see most of the Traders< Traders down there they really want to Traders down there they really want to make< make money and and it's also the reason make money and and it's also the reason is< is because they are not trading their is because they are not trading their own< own money you see when you're not own money you see when you're not trading< trading your own money you you can't trading your own money you you can't really< really be too concerned about your really be too concerned about your downside< downside because for the prop Traders downside because for the prop Traders there< there really isn't any downside in terms there really isn't any downside in terms of< of monetary because they don't out of monetary because they don't out their< their own cash in their own money the their own cash in their own money the problems< problems on the other hand have all the problems on the other hand have all the risk< risk right they do not want just more of risk right they do not want just more of this< this Jokers right to lose everything for this Jokers right to lose everything for them< them right then they are selling out of them right then they are selling out of business business business so< so that's why risk management is very so that's why risk management is very important< important so I want to share with you important so I want to share with you two< two stories that happened back then when two stories that happened back then when I< I was at the prop firm so one of that I was at the prop firm so one of that actually< actually happened on the very first day actually happened on the very first day when< when I joined the prop firm right I was when I joined the prop firm right I was very< very excited very young I went into the very excited very young I went into the problem< problem and then they sent me was like problem and then they sent me was like this< this senior Trader this senior Trader to< to just learn the ins and out of how to just learn the ins and out of how they< they trade right so they have many they trade right so they have many screens< screens and all that so there was this screens and all that so there was this senior< senior Trader on the opposite side of senior Trader on the opposite side of there< there so I was sitting behind so you see there so I was sitting behind so you see this< this Trader on here there's a screen this Trader on here there's a screen behind< behind here I'm sitting behind here and behind here I'm sitting behind here and then< then just directly opposite of me then just directly opposite of me there's< there's this senior Trader down here there's this senior Trader down here right< right so this senior Trader down here right so this senior Trader down here happened< happened to be in a stock that was happened to be in a stock that was caught< caught right the stock certainly had a caught right the stock certainly had a lot< lot of selling going on and then it lot of selling going on and then it pushed< pushed all uh it went all the way down pushed all uh it went all the way down right< right so this Trader got a lot of its right so this Trader got a lot of its bits< bits orders got caught so remember this bits orders got caught so remember this uh< uh picture I showed you down here so he uh picture I showed you down here so he had< had many orders down here all the way had many orders down here all the way down< down so most likely that he got caught down so most likely that he got caught because< because there was a sudden sell order because there was a sudden sell order that< that got him filled on all of this and that got him filled on all of this and he< he didn't have enough time to pull out he didn't have enough time to pull out all< all these orders by himself manually he all these orders by himself manually he didn't< didn't have enough time so what happened didn't have enough time so what happened is< is he's stuck with a huge loss right it is he's stuck with a huge loss right it is< is a very big loss and that point of is a very big loss and that point of time< time he was still holding on to the time he was still holding on to the position< position now we didn't know what exactly position now we didn't know what exactly was< was happening until the big boss man but was happening until the big boss man but there< there was the boss a pretty big there was the boss a pretty big god-sized< god-sized guy and then he came over here god-sized guy and then he came over here and< and stand directly behind this guy down and stand directly behind this guy down here< here so he's a very big towering man here so he's a very big towering man right< right he came out from his room which he right he came out from his room which he never< never usually does and if he comes out never usually does and if he comes out you< you know something is wrong so he stand you know something is wrong so he stand behind< behind this Trader and I just watched behind this Trader and I just watched him< him and just waited for him to see him and just waited for him to see whether< whether he would notice him or say whether he would notice him or say anything< anything but this trailer down here anything but this trailer down here I'm< I'm not sure whether he knew that the I'm not sure whether he knew that the big< big boss man was standing behind him but big boss man was standing behind him but he< he basically just ignored the boss he he basically just ignored the boss he just< just stared at his screen right almost just stared at his screen right almost like< like a deer in a headlight she's not like a deer in a headlight she's not sure< sure what to do so the boss then finally sure what to do so the boss then finally said< said to him in a really loud voice ask said to him in a really loud voice ask him< him you know when are you going to get him you know when are you going to get out< out of the trip right so this Trader out of the trip right so this Trader down< down here just said oh I will get out down here just said oh I will get out soon< soon I'll get out of this off I'll place soon I'll get out of this off I'll place all< all my uh orders without caught so if all my uh orders without caught so if you're< you're caught on all these orders in you're caught on all these orders in order< order for you to get out is either you order for you to get out is either you hit< hit the market right that means you hit hit the market right that means you hit a< a bit to sell out at whatever available a bit to sell out at whatever available price< price there is or you kill on the ask price there is or you kill on the ask hopefully< hopefully somebody will buy up one tick hopefully somebody will buy up one tick and< and clear you out so what he did is that and clear you out so what he did is that he< he decided to kill on the offer instead he decided to kill on the offer instead of< of actually hitting bid right hitting of actually hitting bid right hitting market< market so he killed down here hopefully market so he killed down here hopefully the< the market might trade up a bit and the market might trade up a bit and slowly< slowly uh cleared out his orders his slowly uh cleared out his orders his positions< positions so that he will have a smaller positions so that he will have a smaller loss< loss so he told the boss that he's

here behind the screen and just down here behind the screen and just wondering< wondering oh my goodness what is wondering oh my goodness what is happening< happening right so this is a senior happening right so this is a senior Trader< Trader that has been around for many Trader that has been around for many years< years right later I I learned from the years right later I I learned from the other< other traces that this guy has actually other traces that this guy has actually been< been around for a very long time he was been around for a very long time he was actually< actually also pretty decently profitable actually also pretty decently profitable not< not the most popular Trader around but not the most popular Trader around but he's< he's decently profitable he's decently

the boss didn't actually scold< scold me he asked me one question he scold me he asked me one question he asked< asked me was there anything that you asked me was there anything that you could< could have done better so I was really could have done better so I was really surprised< surprised by this question because I surprised by this question because I thought< thought I was going to get scolded but thought I was going to get scolded but instead< instead this question made me think and instead this question made me think and I< I and I told him this I told him that I and I told him this I told him that yes< yes I could have actually gotten out yes I could have actually gotten out earlier< earlier but I didn't want to right I earlier but I didn't want to right I could< could have immediately hit the bit when could have immediately hit the bit when I< I saw that something was wrong hit the I saw that something was wrong hit the beat< beat get out take my loss instead I beat get

have gotten out earlier actually could have gotten out earlier but< but I didn't because I was hoping to but I didn't because I was hoping to lessen< lessen my loss hopefully the stock would lessen my loss hopefully the stock would trade< trade up so then the boss actually said trade up so then the boss actually said to< to me I'm glad you told me that because to me I'm glad you told me that because he< he was actually sitting at his desk and he was actually sitting at his desk and already< already looking at my screen because at already looking at my screen because at his< his desk he have a lot of monitors as his desk he have a lot of monitors as well< well right the boss have many monitors well right the boss have many monitors so< so the monitors are all about risk right so the monitors are all about risk right he< he can see which Trader is losing how he can see which Trader is losing how much< much he knows all the p l of every much he knows all the p l of every single< single Trader so he's sitting there single Trader so he's sitting there staring< staring at all these screens all day staring at all these screens all day long< long so he said that he was actually

waiting to see what< what I would do so he said that he was what I would do so he said that he was glad< glad that I actually came in and told glad that I actually came in and told him< him about this I initiated this that I him about this I initiated this that I actually< actually uh took a loss rather than wait actually uh took a loss rather than wait for< for him to come out and tell me so for him to come out and tell me so because< because of that he told me that I because of that he told me that I actually< actually uh did well for it right I cut actually uh did well for it right I cut off< off because he mentioned that many other off because he mentioned that many other Traders< Traders right there are many other Traders right there are many other Traders< Traders down here you can see on the Traders down here you can see on the screen< screen down here they were actually in a screen down here they were actually in a loss< loss and they were still in the position loss and they were still in the position I< I was the only one that what that came I was the only one that what that came in< in and I told the boss that I had a a in and I told the boss that I had a a loss< loss so the boss said that he's also loss so the boss said that he's also still< still waiting for this other few guys to still waiting for this other few guys to see< see what they do are they going to just see what they do are they going to just come< come out or do does the boss have to go come out or do does the boss have to go out< out to go and talk to them so the boss out to go and talk to them so the boss told< told me say that luckily you said this told me say that luckily you said this because< because if you were to say something because if you were to say something else< else like give an excuse then he would else like give an excuse then he would have< have scolded me right because he said have scolded me right because he said the< the previous other Trader came in made the previous other Trader came in made an< an excuse that he couldn't get out an excuse that he couldn't get out earlier< earlier right remember if you are in a earlier right remember if you are in a trade< trade you can always get out earlier trade you can always get out earlier there's< there's no such thing as I can't get out there's no such thing as I can't get out earlier< earlier right the excuse that the other earlier right the excuse that the other Trader< Trader made was that because he said Trader made was that because he said that< that he had killed on the offer down that he had killed on the offer down here< here and he said that he was just not here and he said that he was just not taken< taken out so that's why he couldn't get taken out so that's why he couldn't get out< out but that is not true because you out but that is not true because you could< could just hit the bid immediately right could just hit the bid immediately right if< if you hit the bid you are flat you're if you hit the bid you are flat you're out< out of the position you take your loss out of the position you take your loss so< so the reason he's saying he cannot is so the reason he's saying he cannot is because< because he didn't want to he didn't want because he didn't want to he didn't want to< to take the loss such a big of a loss he to take the loss such a big of a loss he wanted< wanted to minimize his loss but because wanted to minimize his loss but because of< of that the market went even lower he of that the market went even lower he took< took even a bigger loss right so that's took even a bigger loss right so that's the< the the story I had for you when it the the story I had for you when it comes< comes to we so the boss even actually comes to we so the boss even actually just< just told me you know now that. you have just told me you know now that you have got< got out of the trade you actually did got out of the trade you actually did well< well enough to know where you're well enough to know where you're supposed< supposed to get out now just relax right supposed to get out now just relax right you're< you're gonna watch a movie right so the you're gonna watch a movie right so the boss< boss actually told me to go and watch a boss actually told me to go and watch a movie< movie on the screen uh remember the the movie on the screen uh remember the the first< first picture which I showed you down first picture which I showed you down here< here this guy with a screen yeah he told here this guy with a screen yeah he told me< me to just go and watch a movie me to just go and watch a movie so< so that's what I did so the rest of the so that's what I did so the rest of the time< time I just went there and I watched a time I just went there and I watched a movie< movie told me don't trade for the day movie told me don't trade for the day come< come back tomorrow refresh start all come back tomorrow refresh start all over< over again meanwhile there was another over again meanwhile there was another Trader< Trader that at the end of the day Trader that at the end of the day apparently< apparently on the screen showed a lot of apparently on the screen showed a lot of profits< profits but the boss was very curious profits but the boss was very curious because< because the boss actually went over to because the boss actually went over to his< his screen there was another guy that his screen there was another guy that was< was sitting down here right on the other was sitting down here right on the other end end end by< by facing this monitor so the boss again by facing this monitor so the boss again went< went behind this guy who is standing went behind this guy who is standing down< down here and I just look at the screen down here and I just look at the screen and< and the boss was very puzzled and that and the boss was very puzzled and that boss< boss was very puzzled and was wondering boss was very puzzled and was wondering what's< what's going on because on his screen he what's going on because on his screen he saw< saw that there was a huge loss there was saw that there was a huge loss there was Major< Major losses but then on this guy's Major losses but then on this guy's screen< screen it shows that it was all profit screen it shows that it was all profit then< then later on he found out that what then later on he found out that what this< this Trader did is he hit the stock this Trader did is he hit the stock right< right he somehow hit the window of the right he somehow hit the window of the stock< stock or he removed I'm not sure what he stock or he removed I'm not sure what he did< did but somehow that the piano was not did but somehow that the piano was not showing< showing up and this boss found out he showing up and this boss found out he was< was so Furious and he fired the trader was so Furious and he fired the trader again< again on the spot right so as you can again on the spot right so as you can see< see again the moral of the story is do see again the moral of the story is do not< not play with risk now as a retail not play with risk now as a retail Trader< Trader all right likely your retail Trader all right likely your retail trading< trading trading your own money you want trading trading your own money you want to< to really manage your risk very well to really manage your risk very well because< because if you don't then guess what you because if you don't then guess what you don't< don't have a boss a big boss man to come don't have a boss a big boss man to come out< out and tell you say Hey you better cut out and tell you say Hey you better cut your< your wrist right now no such thing right your wrist right now no such thing right with< with your own money if you lose all your with your own money if you lose all your money< money that's it that's all your money that's it that's all your hard-earned< hard-earned money all right next how hard-earned money all right next how much< much do prop Traders make so basically much do prop Traders make so basically there< there is a wide range in terms of how there is a wide range in terms of how much< much prop Traders make they can be very much prop Traders make they can be very profitable< profitable like five figures a month I profitable like five figures a month I haven't< haven't seen a Trader that's six figures haven't seen a Trader that's six figures a< a month also mainly because of the the a month also mainly because of the the size< size where the platforms want to size where the platforms want to regulate< regulate right they do not want a sudden regulate right they do not want a sudden one< one single Trader to have too huge of a one single Trader to have too huge of a size< size otherwise you know if the the guy size otherwise you know if the the guy just< just goes broke it's going to lose a lot just goes broke it's going to lose a lot of< of money so the most I've seen is five of money so the most I've seen is five figures< figures so I personally back then right figures so I personally back then right I< I was doing about 40 50 000 a month uh I was doing about 40 50 000 a month uh Trading< Trading but of course it does not all go Trading but of course it does not all go to< to me right as profit sharing and the to me right as profit sharing and the way< way the boss did it for me is that the way the boss did it for me is that the pay< pay which I would get around my profit pay which I would get around my profit share< share will be split over 10 months so I share will be split over 10 months so I do< do not get it all at once right so on do not get it all at once right so on the< the other hand the the prop forms the other hand the the prop forms actually< actually make quite a bit of money so actually make quite a bit of money so you< you can see that right and then on the you can see that right and then on the other< other hand you have traders that are not other hand you have traders that are not profitable< profitable right they still owe the firm profitable right they still owe the firm many< many months of desk fees so I remember I many months of desk fees so I remember I spoke< spoke to one Trader that was relatively spoke to one Trader that was relatively new< new and asked him how he was doing and new and asked him how he was doing and he< he told me that it's not very well it's he told me that it's not very well it's been< been about a year that he has been at been about a year that he has been at the< the firm but he has not really been that the firm but he has not really been that profitable< profitable because he has uh he was not profitable because he has uh he was not that< that consistent seven months he was that consistent seven months he was profitable< profitable Cinemas it's not but he owe profitable Cinemas it's not but he owe many< many months of destiny that for one year many months of destiny that for one year he< he was actually not making money at all he was actually not making money at all in< in fact he was bringing his lunch box to in fact he was bringing his lunch box to the< the firm so I was wondering you know the firm so I was wondering you know every< every time we would ask him to come and every time we would ask him to come and join< join us for lunch to join us for lunch join us for lunch to join us for lunch but< but he wouldn't want to eat lunch with but he wouldn't want to eat lunch with us< us until later on I found out the reason us until later on I found out the reason why< why he brought his lunch box was because why he brought his lunch box was because uh< uh he wasn't making money he couldn't uh he wasn't making money he couldn't afford< afford that right so he has to get his afford that right so he has to get his uh< uh food from home maybe he made it uh food from home maybe he made it himself< himself or his parents made it for him himself or his parents made it for him and< and then he would just pack it to the and then he would just pack it to the the< the training firm and then he would just the training firm and then he would just eat< eat it there so he wouldn't spend money eat it there so he wouldn't spend money right< right sounds a little bit sad but that's right sounds a little bit sad but that's pretty< pretty much how it is all right so pretty much how it is all right so finally< finally how does this relate to you in finally how does this relate to you in terms< terms of trading options so you're terms of trading options so you're trading< trading your own account right now what trading your own account right now what can< can we take away from you know what I've can we take away from you know what I've just< just shared with you today and there are just shared with you today and there are a< a few takeaways I feel it's pretty a few takeaways I feel it's pretty important< important that definitely will help you important that definitely will help you in< in your own trading right now and first in your own trading right now and first of< of all to understand is that of all to understand is that professional< professional Traders trade high professional Traders trade high probability< probability trading strategies where probability trading strategies where they< they take consistent small wins and the they take consistent small wins and the occasional< occasional big loss but overall occasional big loss but overall profitable< profitable right so the beauty about profitable right so the beauty about trading< trading options right is that you can trading options right is that you can design< design your own wrist and reward right design your own wrist and reward right you< you can design your own probability or you can design your own probability or profit< profit you can either go for directional profit you can either go for directional trades< trades right that means you go for maybe trades right that means you go for maybe like< like debit trades whereby there is a like debit trades whereby there is a roughly< roughly 50 percent tons of profit or roughly 50 percent tons of profit or even< even less if you're going for all of the even less if you're going for all of the money< money kind of a debit spreads like all money kind of a debit spreads like all of< of the money call spreads those are low of the money call spreads those are low property< property trades right you may have one property trades right you may have one or< or two just for speculation but you do or two just for speculation but you do not< not want it to be the big part of your not want it to be the big part of your own< own trading account because it's going own trading account because it's going to< to be very hard for you to be right to be very hard for you to be right especially< especially when it comes to options okay especially when it comes to options okay so< so you want to go for trading strategies so you want to go for trading strategies that< that is more than 50 percent right so that is more than 50 percent right so simple< simple strategies like credit spreads simple strategies like credit spreads right< right shot put and also like iron Condor right shot put and also like iron Condor this< this kind of strategies are all higher this kind of strategies are all higher property< property trading strategies so you too property trading strategies so you too should< should choose high quality strategies to should choose high quality strategies to generate< generate a consistent income that's generate a consistent income that's because< because trading a low property strategy because trading a low property strategy right< right can affect your psychology when right can affect your psychology when you< you suffer a losing streak so you will you suffer a losing streak so you will start< start doubting the strategy and also start doubting the strategy and also fear< fear taking the next trade so actually fear taking the next trade so actually share< share this in previous videos of mine share this in previous videos of mine whereby< whereby I show you this table of losing whereby I show you this table of losing streak< streak right so if you have a 50 win streak right so if you have a 50 win rate< rate kind of strategy which is the best rate kind of strategy which is the best best< best that most debit spreads can give best that most debit spreads can give you< you right you then there is a pretty you right you then there is a pretty large< large losing streak that you could face large losing streak that you could face right< right you could lose like you know four right you could lose like you know four to< to five times in a row is very possible to five times in a row is very possible so< so when that happens it actually messes so when that happens it actually messes with< with your psychology you're going to be with your psychology you're going to be a< a little bit afraid of taking the next a little bit afraid of taking the next trade< trade and that can actually affect your trade and that can actually affect your trading< trading strategy your expectancy because trading strategy your expectancy because you< you could be profitable in your next you could be profitable in your next trade< trade but because you got so many losses trade but because you got so many losses in< in a row you're afraid of taking the in a row you're afraid of taking the next< next trade and then you miss that one next trade and then you miss that one out< out right so instead of you know going out right so instead of you know going for< for that you might want to go for higher for that you might want to go for higher property< property strategies because if at the property strategies because if at the end< end of day they're both going to be end of day they're both going to be profitable< profitable then you might as well take profitable then you might as well take the< the easier route right because this way the easier route right because this way you< you actually generate you know more you actually generate you know more consistency< consistency return and have a shorter consistency return and have a shorter smaller< smaller losing streak right for example smaller losing streak right for example if< if your strategy is a 70 win rate then if your strategy is a 70 win rate then the< the chances of you having a losing the chances of you having a losing streak< streak of four or five in a row is very streak of four or five in a row is very very< very very low next it's not necessary to very very low next it's not necessary to trade< trade many underlyings right trade many underlyings right professional< professional Traders focus on a handful professional Traders focus on a handful of< of underlines and thoroughly understand of underlines and thoroughly understand the< the characteristics of what they trade the characteristics of what they trade right< right so professional Traders they trade right so professional Traders they trade a< a handful right maybe five to ten stocks a handful right maybe five to ten stocks even< even in the Futures you nutrient one or even in the Futures you nutrient one or two< two or three products right and for two or three products right and for myself< myself personally for trading options I myself personally for trading options I actually< actually only trade mainly the index actually only trade mainly the index ETFs< ETFs that's the main bunk of my trades ETFs that's the main bunk of my trades they< they are my stable trades which I call they are my stable trades which I call them< them and then I do have some them and then I do have some supplemental< supplemental trades here and there on supplemental trades here and there on stocks< stocks right occasionally but I only stocks right occasionally but I only really< really have a handful of uh stocks which really have a handful of uh stocks which I< I trade right mainly the index ETF so I trade right mainly the index ETF so there< there is really no need for you to there is really no need for you to actually< actually trade so many different actually trade so many different products< products if you don't need to there are products if you don't need to there are many< many other ways to diversify other than many other ways to diversify other than just< just trading different stocks or just trading different stocks or different< different products different products now< now the biggest takeaway from this is now the biggest takeaway from this is the< the risk management part you see risk the risk management part you see risk management< management is very important if you want management is very important if you want to< to stay in this game long enough to be to stay in this game long enough to be profitable< profitable so you are trading your own profitable so you are trading your own hard-earned< hard-earned Capital so you must manage hard-earned Capital so you must manage your< your risk well your risk well and< and more specifically you want to manage and more specifically you want to manage your< your size portrait to make room for the your size portrait to make room for the outlier< outlier risk so you want to allocate no outlier risk so you want to allocate no more< more than five to seven percent on any more than five to seven percent on any single< single trade so remember with high single trade so remember with high probability< probability trading strategies you don't probability trading strategies you don't want< want to say you want to avoid those big want to say you want to avoid those big losses< losses because they are all part and losses because they are all part and parcel< parcel again you cannot avoid these big parcel again you cannot avoid these big losses< losses they will come but you just need losses they will come but you just need to< to make sure that when they do come you to make sure that when they do come you have< have size them appropriately so that have size them appropriately so that they< they do not actually take a big part of they do not actually take a big part of the< the trade right so it's like just the trade right so it's like just driving< driving car if you want to drive a car driving car if you want to drive a car you< you cannot say I want to avoid an you cannot say I want to avoid an accident< accident or avoid traffic jams there's accident or avoid traffic jams there's no< no way for you to avoid that right you no way for you to avoid that right you rather< rather you want to embrace it I expect rather you want to embrace it I expect for< for it and I just plan it out well so in for it and I just plan it out well so in terms< terms of option trading the good thing terms of option trading the good thing is< is that the outlier risk is actually not is that the outlier risk is actually not that< that frequent right the chances of an that frequent right the chances of an outlier< outlier risk where you really hit the outlier risk where you really hit the tail< tail end wrist is very small but they do tail end wrist is very small but they do happen< happen like for example during the 2020 happen like for example during the 2020 pandemic< pandemic crash when they happen you want pandemic crash when they happen you want to< to make sure that your size is not so to make sure that your size is not so big< big that it wiped out your whole account big that it wiped out your whole account okay< okay so that's that's where you hear okay so that's that's where you hear many< many stories where people trade those many stories where people trade those undefined< undefined risks like maybe just shot undefined risks like maybe just shot puts< puts or strangles and then they got puts or strangles and then they got their< their training account wiped out now their training account wiped out now it's< it's not the strategy that is sort of it's not the strategy that is sort of risky< risky but rather it's your risk risky but rather it's your risk management< management right if you're going to management right if you're going to reach< reach like 20 of your account then you reach like 20 of your account then you have< have no one to blame if one single trade have no one to blame if one single trade wipe< wipe out your whole account wipe out your whole account so< so understand that you can't win every so understand that you can't win every single< single trade and you will suffer the single trade and you will suffer the occasional< occasional outlier losses so you must occasional outlier losses so you must keep< keep each trade size small enough and keep each trade size small enough and manageable< manageable soon one loss Will Never wipe manageable soon one loss Will Never wipe you< you out so you can also smooth out your you out so you can also smooth out your p< p l by spreading out your trades so this p l by spreading out your trades so this is< is another way to diversify you don't is another way to diversify you don't have< have to diversify in terms of different have to diversify in terms of different stocks< stocks different products because stocks different products because most< most of the time when the market crashes most of the time when the market crashes right< right such as the pandemic suddenly right such as the pandemic suddenly everything< everything is very correlated they all everything is very correlated they all move< move down at the same time so guess what move down at the same time so guess what if< if you were to place all your trades if you were to place all your trades roughly< roughly around the same time before the roughly around the same time before the pandemic< pandemic when the pandemic comes all pandemic when the pandemic comes all your< your positions will be hit so rather your positions will be hit so rather than< than doing that there's another way is than doing that there's another way is that< that you can diversify by time right so that you can diversify by time right so that< that means you can space them out that that means you can space them out that means< means different days different weeks means different days different weeks different< different months you have different different months you have different trades< trades on you can diversify by Price trades on you can diversify by Price different< different price levels you can diversify different price levels you can diversify by< by the option expiration date right the by the option expiration date right the days< days to expression different strategies days to expression different strategies you< you have neutral strategies bullying you have neutral strategies bullying strategies< strategies uh bearish strategies and strategies uh bearish strategies and then< then also by Delta right you can have uh then also by Delta right you can have uh small< small Deltas High Deltas so by spreading small Deltas High Deltas so by spreading all< all this out you have a much more all this out you have a much more smoother< smoother p l rather than you know you smoother p l rather than you know you take< take the same trade on the same day take the same trade on the same day across< across different products next across different products next understand< understand that to achieve the true understand that to achieve the true probability< probability you need to clock enough probability you need to clock enough trade< trade so again I mentioned this in a trade so again I mentioned this in a previous< previous video so the best example or previous video so the best example or the< the simplest example I can give you is the simplest example I can give you is just< just flipping a coin right it's a 50 50 just flipping a coin right it's a 50 50 chance< chance to get hits or tails but if you chance to get hits or tails but if you were< were to flip it 10 times there's a were to flip it 10 times there's a chance< chance for it to get seven hits and chance for it to get seven hits and three< three Tails so imagine hits are when you three Tails so imagine hits are when you lose< lose so if you get seven losses does it lose so if you get seven losses does it mean< mean that this strategy is not working mean that this strategy is not working out< out doesn't mean that way because if you out doesn't mean that way because if you were< were to flip that coin a thousand times were to flip that coin a thousand times then< then chances are you're gonna get very then chances are you're gonna get very close< close to 50 of the time you're gonna get close to 50 of the time you're gonna get hits< hits fifty percent of the time you're hits fifty percent of the time you're gonna< gonna get Tails right so this is gonna get Tails right so this is important< important to understand as well and important to understand as well and finally< finally you want to think of your finally you want to think of your trading< trading as a business like you're a prop trading as a business like you're a prop firm< firm so remember I told you that firm so remember I told you that problems< problems primary focus is to manage risk problems primary focus is to manage risk so< so how the management is that they hire so how the management is that they hire all< all these Traders so all these Traders all these Traders so all these Traders are< are basically like your option trades are basically like your option trades you< you have maybe one trade here there so you have maybe one trade here there so maybe< maybe this this one of your option trade maybe this this one of your option trade this< this is a bearish trade this is a this is a bearish trade this is a bullish< bullish trade this is a neutral trade bullish trade this is a neutral trade basically< basically you have all this small little basically you have all this small little trades< trades going on but at the end of the trades going on but at the end of the day< day you do not not want any of these day you do not not want any of these trades< trades to wipe you out right just like trades to wipe you out right just like how< how this firms they do not want any of how this firms they do not want any of this< this single Traders any of them to just this single Traders any of them to just close< close down their business to work them close down their business to work them out< out of all the money that they've made out of all the money that they've made so< so far all right guys so that's it for so far all right guys so that's it for this< this video I hope

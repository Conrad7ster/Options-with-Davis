=================================================================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you three I'm going to be sharing with you three option< option strategies that can help you option strategies that can help you generate< generate consistent profits so all these generate consistent profits so all these three< three strategies that I'm going to be three strategies that I'm going to be sharing< sharing with you today all have their sharing with you today all have their win< win rate that is above 80% and in win rate that is above 80% and in certain< certain cases you can actually construct certain cases you can actually construct them< them to be more than 90% all right so them to be more than 90% all right so let's< let's dive into these three strategies let's dive into these three strategies so< so the very first one that I'm going to so the very first one that I'm going to share< share with you is what is called the share with you is what is called the broken< broken wing butterflies all right so the broken wing butterflies all right so the very< very first thing we want to do when we very first thing we want to do when we are< are constructing the put broken are constructing the put broken butterfly< butterfly is to choose our expiration butterfly is to choose our expiration date< date or the DTE so as you can see down date or the DTE so as you can see down here< here there are quite a number of uh here there are quite a number of uh different< different DTE dates so the one that I different DTE dates so the one that I like< like to choose is close to 45 DTE and I like to choose is close to 45 DTE and I explained< explained this in quite a number of my explained this in quite a number of my videos< videos already so I'm not going to go videos already so I'm not going to go into< into detail here so basically the into detail here so basically the closest< closest one is going to be this one down closest one is going to be this one down here< here where there is about 43 days right here where there is about 43 days right so< so I'm going to open up the option chain so I'm going to open up the option chain here< here now the next thing you want to do here now the next thing you want to do is< is to choose the short strike for the is to choose the short strike for the put< put broking butterfly right to choose put broking butterfly right to choose the< the short strike the one that we want to the short strike the one that we want to look< look out for is this Delta column down look out for is this Delta column down here< here so we're going to decide our short here so we're going to decide our short strike< strike based on the Delta because the strike based on the Delta because the Delta< Delta pretty much determines what is the Delta pretty much determines what is the win< win rate of your strategy based on where win rate of your strategy based on where you< you choose your short strike at so I'm you choose your short strike at so I'm going< going to go all the way up down here I'm going to go all the way up down here I'm going< going to select more strikes so the one going to select more strikes so the one that< that I'm really looking out for is that I'm really looking out for is somewhere< somewhere from 15 to 20 Delta so as you somewhere from 15 to 20 Delta so as you can< can see it's somewhere around here so can see it's somewhere around here so how< how do you know whether the strategy is how do you know whether the strategy is going< going to have you know more than 80% win going to have you know more than 80% win rate< rate or not so a very quick hack is by rate or not so a very quick hack is by taking< taking a look at the Delta down here taking a look at the Delta down here because< because the Delta also gives an because the Delta also gives an indication< indication of this strike being in the indication of this strike being in the money< money at expiration right so if it says money at expiration right so if it says 20< 20 Deltas it means to say there's a 20% 20 Deltas it means to say there's a 20% chance< chance that it's going to be in the chance that it's going to be in the money< money at expiration which means to say money at expiration which means to say that< that it's going to be a loss right but that it's going to be a loss right but it< it also means to say there is an 80% it also means to say there is an 80% chance< chance that it's going to be out of the chance that it's going to be out of the money< money which means to say the price the money which means to say the price. the market< market is going to land somewhere Above market is going to land somewhere Above This< This 466 strike down here so we want to This 466 strike down here so we want to craft< craft it whereby you know if the short craft it whereby you know if the short strike< strike somewhere around 20 Delta then we strike somewhere around 20 Delta then we know< know that our win rate is going to know that our win rate is going to automatically< automatically be more than 80% right so automatically be more than 80% right so the< the broken wing butterfly if you're not the broken wing butterfly if you're not very< very familiar with it basically just is very familiar with it basically just is a< a combination of a put credit spread a combination of a put credit spread that< that is financing a put debit spread that is financing a put debit spread right< right so for this we're just going to right so for this we're just going to construct< construct the uh put credit spread side construct the uh put credit spread side first< first so what I'm going to do is I'm first so what I'm going to do is I'm just< just use this 20 Delta down here this just use this 20 Delta down here this 466< 466 strike down here as an example so 466 strike down here as an example so I'm< I'm going to choose this 466 strike and I'm going to choose this 466 strike and then< then I'm going to choose the uh wings then I'm going to choose the uh wings that< that is 10 points wi just as an example that is 10 points wi just as an example first< first so we're going to go to choose the first so we're going to go to choose the 10< 10 points away from 466 which is 456 so 10 points away from 466 which is 456 so right< right now we have a 10o white credit right now we have a 10o white credit spread< spread this is a put credit spread now spread this is a put credit spread now we< we need to use this credit down here we need to use this credit down here which< which you can see is a doar 6 to finance which you can see is a doar 6 to finance the< the purchase of a put deit spread so in the purchase of a put deit spread so in order< order to purchase a put deit spread that order to purchase a put deit spread that is< is going to be cheaper than this credit is going to be cheaper than this credit which< which we have it means to say the width which we have it means to say the width of< of this put debit spread has to be of this put debit spread has to be smaller< smaller than 10 points y so again as an smaller than 10 points y so again as an example< example I'm just going to choose 5 example I'm just going to choose 5 Points< Points y so I'm going to choose this 471 Points y so I'm going to choose this 471 and< and then 466 so because we already have and then 466 so because we already have the< the short strike at 466 what we're going the short strike at 466 what we're going to< to do is go down here and I'm going to to do is go down here and I'm going to change< change this to two so this as you can change this to two so this as you can see< see the system already recognize it as a see the system already recognize it as a butterfly< butterfly right so overall you're going butterfly right so overall you're going to< to get a net credit for this now if you to get a net credit for this now if you get< get a net debit then know that you're get a net debit then know that you're doing< doing something wrong right let's say doing something wrong right let's say for< for example if you chose the put debit for example if you chose the put debit spread< spread to be slightly wider let's say spread to be slightly wider let's say 475< 475 then you notice that this is a 61 475 then you notice that this is a 61 cents< cents debit right if there's no minus cents debit right if there's no minus sign< sign down here this is debit that means sign down here this is debit that means you're< you're paying for it and if you're you're paying for it and if you're paying< paying for it it just means that it's paying for it it just means that it's not< not going to be you know riskless to one not going to be you know riskless to one side< side in fact now there's going to be side in fact now there's going to be risk< risk to both s side so this is one thing risk to both s side so this is one thing you< you need to really take note of when you need to really take note of when you're< you're constructing the broken wing you're constructing the broken wing butterfly< butterfly so let's adjust this back to butterfly so let's adjust this back to the< the 5. Y so again as you can see down the 5.

Y so again as you can see down here< here we have 24 cents in credit which here we have 24 cents in credit which means< means to say $24 for selling this put means to say $24 for selling this put broken< broken wing butterfly now the next thing broken wing butterfly now the next thing is< is to take a look at our p&amp;l graph which is to take a look at our p&amp;l graph which is< is down here so this is the typical p&amp;l is down here so this is the typical p&amp;l graph< graph for the broken wing butterfly graph for the broken wing butterfly right< right as you can see there's absolutely right as you can see there's absolutely no< no risk to the upside so this is where no risk to the upside so this is where the< the current market price is let me just the current market price is let me just get< get my drawing tool so this is where the get my drawing tool so this is where the current< current market price is as you can see current market price is as you can see when< when you first put it on if the market when you first put it on if the market just< just goes all the way up then you're not just goes all the way up then you're not going< going to lose money right you're going going to lose money right you're going to< to make the minimum credit which you to make the minimum credit which you sold< sold this whole structure for so in this sold this whole structure for so in this case< case it's going to be $24 now if the case it's going to be $24 now if the market< market goes down then you also have a market goes down then you also have a chance< chance to make more than this $24 chance to make more than this $24 because< because if it lands somewhere in this because if it lands somewhere in this tent< tent at expiration then you're going to tent at expiration then you're going to make< make much more than that right so how make much more than that right so how much< much more so it comes down to exactly much more so it comes down to exactly which< which part of the tent it lands in so which part of the tent it lands in so the< the way to see how much you're going to the way to see how much you're going to make< make is basically you just hover your make is basically you just hover your cursor< cursor over you know the different price cursor over you know the different price points< points so let's say for example it land points so let's say for example it land somewhere< somewhere around here then you're going somewhere around here then you're going to< to be making somewhere around to be making somewhere around $243< $243 if you pin this shot St expiration $243 if you pin this shot St expiration then< then it's going to be then it's going to be $453< $453 now all the way to the left hand $453 now all the way to the left hand side< side you can see that this is where your side you can see that this is where your max< max loss is right this is where your max max loss is right this is where your max loss< loss so if the market goes too far down loss so if the market goes too far down then< then one thing is that your max loss has then one thing is that your max loss has already< already been kept right so if it goes already been kept right so if it goes all< all the way to zero you don't have to all the way to zero you don't have to worry< worry about that as well because the worry about that as well because the most< most you can lose as you can see on this most you can lose as you can see on this graph< graph over here let me just change the graph over here let me just change the cursor< cursor is about cursor is about $476< $476 so the max loss is 476 and the max $476 so the max loss is 476 and the max profit< profit is somewhere around profit is somewhere around $462< $462 which means to say it's roughly a 1 $462 which means to say it's roughly a 1 is< is to one which is not so bad now the P is to one which is not so bad now the P broken< broken wing butterfly is a pretty broken wing butterfly is a pretty flexible< flexible structure in which you can flexible structure in which you can actually< actually you know just change the actually you know just change the strikes< strikes up a little bit and you can have strikes up a little bit and you can have a< a slightly different structure based on. a slightly different structure based on what< what you want let's say for for example what you want let's say for for example you< you want slightly more credit on the you want slightly more credit on the right< right hand side right if you want more right hand side right if you want more credit< credit then this is what you do so first credit then this is what you do so first of< of all let me just remove this drawing of all let me just remove this drawing and< and then we want to go back to the and then we want to go back to the option< option chain above so right now we option chain above so right now we already< already have a fiveo wide debit spread already have a fiveo wide debit spread now< now in order to have more credit up now in order to have more credit up front< front then what you want to do is you front then what you want to do is you want< want to reduce this size of this put want to reduce this size of this put debit< debit spread so maybe you go down to debit spread so maybe you go down to only< only 3 points wi so if you get three only 3 points wi so if you get three points< points wi for the put debit spread you points wi for the put debit spread you notice< notice that your credit goes up to 60 notice that your credit goes up to 60 which< which is $60 when you sell this uh which is $60 when you sell this uh broken< broken wing butterfly so let's take a broken wing butterfly so let's take a look< look at the p&amp;l graph so you can see the look at the p&amp;l graph so you can see the p&amp;l< p&amp;l graph down here on the right hand p&amp;l graph down here on the right hand side< side you notice that it's now slightly side you notice that it's now slightly thicker< thicker than just now right it's thicker than just now right it's slightly< slightly thicker so which means to say slightly thicker so which means to say now< now you know if the market goes all the now you know if the market goes all the way< way up you can make slightly more than way up you can make slightly more than just< just now now the trade-off is that you just now now the trade-off is that you will< will notice that your tent over here is will notice that your tent over here is so< so much smaller right your 10 your max so much smaller right your 10 your max profit< profit zone so to speak is going to be profit zone so to speak is going to be much< much smaller which means to say if you much smaller which means to say if you want< want to hit this at expiration there's want to hit this at expiration there's going< going to be lesser chance also what going to be lesser chance also what you'll< you'll notice is that your max loss you'll notice is that your max loss actually< actually also increased right because actually also increased right because the< the max profit from the put debit spread the max profit from the put debit spread is< is now only close to $300 right as you is now only close to $300 right as you can< can see it's about $298 or so so because can see it's about $298 or so so because of< of this reduced profit from the max of this reduced profit from the max profit< profit Zone it actually increases the profit Zone it actually increases the max< max loss which you have so this is if max loss which you have so this is if you< you want to have you know more credit up you want to have you know more credit up front< front now what if you're slightly more front now what if you're slightly more you< you know conservative and you're afraid you know conservative and you're afraid that< that the market might go down and you do that the market might go down and you do not< not want to lose that much then this is not want to lose that much then this is where< where you want to change it whereby the where you want to change it whereby the tent< tent is slightly bigger so let me just tent is slightly bigger so let me just remove< remove the drawings and let's get back remove the drawings and let's get back to< to the option chain again now in order to the option chain again now in order for< for you to have a bigger tent you just for you to have a bigger tent you just have< have to widen up this put debit spread have to widen up this put debit spread so< so previously the original one which we so previously the original one which we have< have is 5. y so let's try 6.

y so we try have is 5. y so let's try 6.

y so we try 6. < 6.

y down here you notice that we only 6. y down here you notice that we only get< get about 5 cents credit right which is get about 5 cents credit right which is $5< $5 but the trade-off is that now you $5 but the trade-off is that now you actually< actually have a much bigger tent right actually have a much bigger tent right as< as you can see down here the tent is so as you can see down here the tent is so much< much bigger and your max profit Zone has much bigger and your max profit Zone has also< also widened up right as you can see also widened up right as you can see down< down here this profit Zone down here down here this profit Zone down here becomes< becomes bigger which means to say you becomes bigger which means to say you have< have a greater chance right now to land have a greater chance right now to land somewhere< somewhere inside this tent over here and somewhere inside this tent over here and what< what you also notice is that your max what you also notice is that your max loss< loss has also been reduced dramatically loss has also been reduced dramatically right< right as you can see now the max loss is right as you can see now the max loss is 395< 395 compared to the one just previously 395 compared to the one just previously is< is about $600 OD dollars and now this is about $600 OD dollars and now this Max< Max profit it is Max profit it is $540< $540 right so now your win rate is $540 right so now your win rate is slightly< slightly better in terms of your max slightly better in terms of your max reward< reward to your max risk right so this is reward to your max risk right so this is how< how you actually play around with the how you actually play. around with the strikes< strikes to construct a different broken strikes to construct a different broken wing< wing butterfly so this is the very first wing butterfly so this is the very first option< option strategy now the next option option strategy now the next option strategy< strategy is actually just a variation of strategy is actually just a variation of this< this broken wing butterfly so why is this broken wing butterfly so why is this< this strategy right so let's go up to this strategy right so let's go up to this< this option chain down here so let me this option chain down here so let me just< just remove this drawing go up to the just remove this drawing go up to the option< option chain again again so for this option chain again again so for this next< next structure is what is called the put next structure is what is called the put Condor< Condor so how does this work by the way Condor so how does this work by the way if< if you like this video so far Please if you like this video so far Please Subscribe< Subscribe and also click the thumbs up Subscribe and also click the thumbs up button< button and also do get your free copy of button and also do get your free copy of the< the options income blueprint where I the options income blueprint where I share< share the top three options strategies share the top three options strategies that< that help you generate a consistent that help you generate a consistent income< income each month trading just one to income each month trading just one to two< two hours a day right so if you want to two hours a day right so if you want to go< go ahead to get this copy just head on go ahead to get this copy just head on over< over to options with davis.

com blueprint over to options with davis. com blueprint all< all right back to the video so right now all right back to the video so right now what< what we have is this uh credit spread what we have is this uh credit spread this< this put credit spread and the put this put credit spread and the put average< average spread both of them they are average spread both of them they are sharing< sharing the same uh strike down here the sharing the same uh strike down here the same< same short strip now for you to same short strip now for you to construct< construct this put Condor you all you construct this put Condor you all you have< have to do is just shift this whole put have to do is just shift this whole put debit< debit spread much away from where the debit spread much away from where the put< put credit spread is so what I'm going put credit spread is so what I'm going to< to do is that I'm going to remove this to do is that I'm going to remove this strike< strike down here I'm going to change strike down here I'm going to change this< this back to one so what's left down this back to one so what's left down here< here is our put credit spread now we here is our put credit spread now we want< want to use this want to use this $16< $16 in premium which we have to finance $16 in premium which we have to finance our< our put debit spread so what I'm going our put debit spread so what I'm going to< to do down here is I'm going to shift to do down here is I'm going to shift the< the put debit spread to somewhere near the put debit spread to somewhere near at< at the market right so let's say for at the market right so let's say for example< example I'm going to choose 484 and example I'm going to choose 484 and let's< let's just see you know how wide of a let's just see you know how wide of a put< put debit spread we can actually get put debit spread we can actually get without< without getting into a debit so let's without getting into a debit so let's choose< choose two points wide now you notice if choose two points wide now you notice if I< I go two points wide I can still get a I go two points wide I can still get a credit< credit what about if I go three points credit what about if I go three points wide< wide three points wide is going to be a wide three points wide is going to be a debit< debit which means to say we've already debit which means to say we've already you< you know reached the threshold of what you know reached the threshold of what we< we can stretch the put D spread too so we can stretch the put D spread too so we< we got to stick at just two points why we got to stick at just two points why so< so if you were to take a look at the so if you were to take a look at the panl< panl graph you notice now it looks panl graph you notice now it looks something< something like this so this is a slight something like this so this is a slight variation< variation of the uh put broking variation of the uh put broking butterfly< butterfly all you're essentially doing butterfly all you're essentially doing is< is just splitting up the spread from one is just splitting up the spread from one another< another right so the put credit spread another right so the put credit spread and< and the put debit spread is just further and the put debit spread is just further away< away now when you do this the trade-off away now when you do this the trade-off is< is that firstly you get lesser Max is that firstly you get lesser Max profit< profit than compared to the put broking profit than compared to the put broking butterfly< butterfly right the put broking butterfly right the put broking butterfly< butterfly at the apex of the 10th you butterfly at the apex of the 10th you get< get much more profit R for this you only get much more profit R for this you only get< get about 229 now although you get a get about 229 now although you get a lower< lower Max profit your max profit Zone lower Max profit your max profit Zone has< has been dramatically increased right as has been dramatically increased right as you< you can see down here your max profit you can see down here your max profit zone< zone is now very wide in fact as long as zone is now very wide in fact as long as the< the market closes below where the the market closes below where the current< current market price is as long as it current market price is as long as it does< does not go past this break even zone of does not go past this break even zone of course< course you're going to be in a profit course you're going to be in a profit right< right because this is where the current right because this is where the current market< market price is again right so if the market price is again right so if the market< market goes down market goes down even< even it goes down even slightly just by even it goes down even slightly just by a< a little bit you are already inside the a little bit you are already inside the max< max profit zone right so this is the put max profit zone right so this is the put Condor< Condor or the skew Condor right so as Condor or the skew Condor right so as you< you can see down here the system you can see down here the system recognizes< recognizes it as a condor now this is recognizes it as a condor now this is not< not to be mistaken for the iron Condor not to be mistaken for the iron Condor now< now the iron Condor with the name iron now the iron Condor with the name iron you< you just have to know that there's a you just have to know that there's a combination< combination of both put and call options combination of both put and call options right< right but in this case it is all put so right but in this case it is all put so if< if you have the Condor structure that if you have the Condor structure that looks< looks like this and it's only all one looks like this and it's only all one type< type of options then it's just going to type of options then it's just going to be< be called The Condor all right okay so be called The Condor all right okay so for< for here let's take a look at what's the for here let's take a look at what's the max< max loss for this uh structure as you max loss for this uh structure as you can< can see the max loss down here is 771 so can see the max loss down here is 771 so 771< 771 down here and your max profit is 229 771 down here and your max profit is 229 which< which is I think roughly about 1 is to 3 which is I think roughly about 1 is to 3 point< point something just slightly under 1 is point something just slightly under 1 is to< to 4 right so if you want to change the to 4 right so if you want to change the structure< structure of this you actually can as structure of this you actually can as well< well right so for example if you want well right so for example if you want slightly< slightly more credit up front this is slightly more credit up front this is what< what you do all you got to do is just what you do all you got to do is just shift< shift this put debit spread slightly shift this put debit spread slightly downwards< downwards in a sense whereby below where downwards in a sense whereby below where the< the current market price is right so if the current market price is right so if you< you see this uh strike down here you can you see this uh strike down here you can see< see the current market price is see the current market price is somewhere< somewhere within down here right this is somewhere within down here right this is where< where the at the money is so if we were where the at the money is so if we were to< to shift the strikes down here let me to shift the strikes down here let me just< just shift it down let's say I go to 482 just shift it down let's say I go to 482 and< and 480 now you're going to have and 480 now you're going to have slightly< slightly more credit UPF front right and slightly more credit UPF front right and if< if you take a look at the structure over if you take a look at the structure over here< here you can see that you have slightly here you can see that you have slightly higher< higher profit down here but now you have higher profit down here but now you have a< a slightly smaller Max profit zone right a slightly smaller Max profit zone right the< the the range is going to be smaller so the the range is going to be smaller so this< this is the put Condor so now I've this is the put Condor so now I've really< really shared with you two strategies really shared with you two strategies right< right the first strategy is the put right the first strategy is the put bring< bring butterfly whereby you know the bring butterfly whereby you know the Apex< Apex is somewhere down here right you Apex is somewhere down here right you have< have a 10th and this is the max profit have a 10th and this is the max profit now< now if you were to just split up this now if you were to just split up this put< put debit spread down here and you shift put debit spread down here and you shift it< it to the right then this is where it to the right then this is where you're< you're going to get this put Condor now you're going to get this put Condor now for< for the final strategy I'm going to for the final strategy I'm going to share< share. with you all it's going to be share with you all it's going to be doing< doing is again shifting this right side doing is again shifting this right side of< of the spread even further to the right of the spread even further to the right side< side so now we're going to have this side so now we're going to have this spread< spread that pushed to the right that is spread that pushed to the right that is above< above where the current market price is above where the current market price is and< and I call this the Jade iron Condor so and I call this the Jade iron Condor so how< how do you construct the J iron Condor how do you construct the J iron Condor so< so first of all the put broking so first of all the put broking butterfly< butterfly if you recall is basically butterfly if you recall is basically this< this put deage spread down here shares this put deage spread down here shares the< the same short strike as the put credit the same short strike as the put credit spread< spread now for the put Condor what we're spread now for the put Condor what we're going< going to do is we're going to stretch it going to do is we're going to stretch it out< out whereas somewhere just below where out whereas somewhere just below where the< the current market price is right so for the current market price is right so for the< the Jade Condor we're going to push this the Jade Condor we're going to push this even< even further out right so now it's going even further out right so now it's going to< to be above where the current market to be above where the current market price< price is so we want to shift it price is so we want to shift it somewhere< somewhere around here but we are not somewhere around here but we are not going< going to use this put debit spread here going to use this put debit spread here because< because if you were to use this put because if you were to use this put debit< debit spread somewhere down here what's debit spread somewhere down here what's going< going to happen is that this is going to going to happen is that this is going to be< be considered an in the money put debit be considered an in the money put debit spread< spread and as you know any short putut spread and as you know any short putut that< that is going to be in the money there's that is going to be in the money there's going< going to be a chance of being assigned going to be a chance of being assigned early< early so this is not what we're going to early so this is not what we're going to do< do right on top of that usually any in do right on top of that usually any in the< the money strikes the bit andr spread is the money strikes the bit andr spread is going< going to be generally wider than if you going to be generally wider than if you were< were to use the counterpart which is the were to use the counterpart which is the call< call side right so for this we are just call side right so for this we are just going< going to shift this from the put side to going to shift this from the put side to the< the call side so we're going to the call side so we're going to construct< construct the J Condor using a call construct the J Condor using a call spread< spread so how do you know which Delta to spread so how do you know which Delta to use< use so generally I like to use somewhere use so generally I like to use somewhere around< around 30 to 35 Deltas so let's say around 30 to 35 Deltas so let's say let's< let's just use 35 Deltas as the short let's just use 35 Deltas as the short strike< strike here here and this is where we strike here here and this is where we want< want to construct our call Credit spread want to construct our call Credit spread so< so for the Jade iron Condor what we're so for the Jade iron Condor what we're going< going to have is a put credit spread and going to have is a put credit spread and a< a call Credit spread so it's very a call Credit spread so it's very similar< similar to the iron Condor the only similar to the iron Condor the only difference< difference is that we want to have a difference is that we want to have a much< much smaller call spread on this side much smaller call spread on this side because< because we do not want to have any risk because we do not want to have any risk to< to the upside right so in this case we to the upside right so in this case we want< want to construct one where we do not want to construct one where we do not have< have risk to the upside so how do we do have risk to the upside so how do we do that< that we do that by simply knowing you that we do that by simply knowing you know< know what is the credit we receive know what is the credit we receive compared< compared to the width of this call compared to the width of this call spread< spread so basically in general the rule spread so basically in general the rule of< of thumb is that if you do not want to of thumb is that if you do not want to have< have any risk to the upside then the have any risk to the upside then the total< total credit which you receive has to be total credit which you receive has to be bigger< bigger than the width of the call site bigger than the width of the call site so< so as you can see in this case if I have so as you can see in this case if I have a< a 1 point wide call spread and then my a 1 point wide call spread and then my credit< credit I received is credit I received is a143< a143 it just means that if the market a143 it just means that if the market goes< goes past this point at 495 I'm not goes past this point at 495 I'm not going< going to take a loss in fact I'm going going to take a loss in fact I'm going to< to have a spillover of roughly 43 cents to have a spillover of roughly 43 cents right< right so you can take a look at the p&amp;l right so you can take a look at the p&amp;l growth< growth as well to take a look at this so growth as well to take a look at this so as< as you can see down here this again is as you can see down here this again is where< where the current market price is and where the current market price is and this< this is where our call spread is down this is where our call spread is down here< here so if the market goes all the way here so if the market goes all the way up< up past our call spread we still can get up past our call spread we still can get the< the minimum profit which is the the minimum profit which is the difference< difference between the credit and the difference between the credit and the call< call spread width right so if the call call spread width right so if the call spread< spread width is $1 and I receive $143 spread width is $1 and I receive $143 which< which means to say my Max profit on the which means to say my Max profit on the right< right hand side is going to be roughly right hand side is going to be roughly around< around $43 right so as you can see the around $43 right so as you can see the p&amp;l< p&amp;l it says4 three and then all the way p&amp;l it says4 three and then all the way on< on the left hand side our Max loss is on the left hand side our Max loss is $857< $857 so as you can see down here this $857 so as you can see down here this Jade< Jade iron Condor again is pretty similar Jade iron Condor again is pretty similar to< to the put Condor which we used early on to the put Condor which we used early on all< all we're doing is that we're Shifting all we're doing is that we're Shifting the< the spread side to the right hand side the spread side to the right hand side and< and instead of getting a debit spread and instead of getting a debit spread right< right now we're getting a credit spread right now we're getting a credit spread in< in the call option side so as you can in the call option side so as you can see< see they are all pretty similar to each see they are all pretty similar to each other< other and for this you're going to have other and for this you're going to have have< have a much wider Max profit Zone but have a much wider Max profit Zone but then< then the trade-off is that you're going then the trade-off is that you're going to< to have you know slightly lesser Max to have you know slightly lesser Max profit< profit at the profit zone so as you can profit at the profit zone so as you can see< see down here your max profit is around see down here your max profit is around $143< $143 and then your max loss is roughly $143 and then your max loss is roughly $857< $857 so with this Jade iron Condor you $857 so with this Jade iron Condor you can< can actually try and you know roughly can actually try and you know roughly change< change the strikes and see what is the change the strikes and see what is the most< most you can get in terms of this spread most you can get in terms of this spread right< right so let's take a look at if we were right so let's take a look at if we were to< to craft say two points by if we craft to craft say two points by if we craft two< two points wide you notice that our two points wide you notice that our credit< credit is only going to be.

77 which credit is only going to be. 77 which means< means to say we're going to have a risk means to say we're going to have a risk to< to the upside right if you take a look to the upside right if you take a look at< at the p&amp;l graph down here you notice at the p&amp;l graph down here you notice right< right now let me just remove this right now let me just remove this drawings< drawings you can see that right now from drawings you can see that right now from here< here onwards it's all going to be a loss here onwards it's all going to be a loss although< although it's just going to be a minimum although it's just going to be a minimum loss< loss but if you do it this way what's loss but if you do it this way what's going< going to happen is that your max profit going to happen is that your max profit here< here is going to increase so as you can here is going to increase so as you can see< see down here the max profit is going to see down here the max profit is going to be< be slightly higher than just now just be slightly higher than just now just now< now it's 143 now it's now it's 143 now it's $177 $177 $177 but< but now your win rate is going to be but now your win rate is going to be reduced< reduced because your win. rate right now reduced because your win rate right now is< is only going to be in the middle down is only going to be in the middle down here< here and if the market goes too far out here and if the market goes too far out from< from this point on it's going to be a from this point on it's going to be a loss< loss so this won't be an 80% win rate so loss so this won't be an 80% win rate so this< this is a structure that we do not want this is a structure that we do not want to< to craft right so we want to structure to craft right so we want to structure it< it differently again so we know that we it differently again so we know that we probably< probably cannot go for 2 points y we probably cannot go for 2 points y we only< only can go for 1 point Y if you want to only can go for 1 point Y if you want to go< go for two points y then maybe you need go for two points y then maybe you need to< to go for a slightly higher Delta in to go for a slightly higher Delta in this< this case so let's try 488 and this case so let's try 488 and 490< 490 and you can see down here we have 490 and you can see down here we have $2.

7< $2. 7 credit for a $2 wide credit spread $2.

7 credit for a $2 wide credit spread with< with down here which means to say with with down here which means to say with this< this structure down here we are going to this structure down here we are going to get< get a higher Max profit so as you can get a higher Max profit so as you can see< see it's going to be $27 Which is higher see it's going to be $27 Which is higher than< than $177 or $143 just now but if it than $177 or $143 just now but if it goes< goes too far to the right hand side from goes too far to the right hand side from this< this point onwards if it goes past here this point onwards if it goes past here then< then you're just going to make you know then you're just going to make you know the< the minimum right which is about $7 the minimum right which is about $7 right< right as you can see so as you can see right as you can see so as you can see guys< guys this is all pretty much a tradeoff guys this is all pretty much a tradeoff and< and the structures are all pretty and the structures are all pretty similar< similar to each other if you want to similar to each other if you want to have< have more max profit then you want to go have more max profit then you want to go for< for the broken wing butterfly if you for the broken wing butterfly if you want< want to have something in the middle want to have something in the middle which< which is a balance of you know pretty which is a balance of you know pretty nice< nice uh Max profit as well as you know nice uh Max profit as well. as you know pretty< pretty decent wi Max profit zone go for pretty decent wi Max profit zone go for the< the put Condor and if you want one that the put Condor and if you want one that has< has a very very wide profit Zone but you has a very very wide profit Zone but you do< do not mind you know the credit not do not mind you know the credit not being< being that much then you can go for the being that much then you can go for the Jade< Jade iron Condor all right so I hope you Jade iron Condor all right so I hope you found< found this video helpful and if you have found this video helpful and if you have I< I greatly appreciate if you give me a I greatly appreciate if you give me a thumbs< thumbs up on this video by the way if thumbs up on this video by the way if you< you like this video then you're you like this video then you're absolutely< absolutely going to love this next video absolutely going to love this next video which< which I have for you so go ahead and which I have for you so go ahead and watch< watch that video right now also if you watch that video right now also if you haven't< haven't already gotten your free copy of haven't already gotten your free copy of the< the options income blueprint you can do the options income blueprint you can do so< so just by clicking this link down here so just by clicking this link down here on< on your screen and you'll be able to get on your screen and you'll be able to get it< it for free all right I will see you in it for free all right I will see you in the<

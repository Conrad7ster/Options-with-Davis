================================================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so today's topic is all right alrighty so today's topic is on< on profiting from overreaction and on profiting from overreaction and volatility< volatility Spikes all right so if you volatility Spikes all right so if you have< have been monitoring the market have been monitoring the market situation< situation in the past week or so then situation in the past week or so then you< you will know that there has been this you will know that there has been this Fiasco< Fiasco going on with the banks in Fiasco going on with the banks in America< America again but basically uh it's just America again but basically uh it's just the< the Silicon Valley Bank and the smaller the Silicon Valley Bank and the smaller Banks< Banks so there has been a lot of this Banks so there has been a lot of this Fiasco< Fiasco going on and the market has made Fiasco going on and the market has made very< very big moves a lot of overreaction as very big moves a lot of overreaction as well< well as well as their volatility spikes well as well as their volatility spikes so< so these are the times where you can so these are the times where you can actually< actually have some opportunities to sell actually have some opportunities to sell premium< premium because as we know when the premium because as we know when the volatility< volatility really spikes then the volatility really spikes then the premium< premium is going to be pretty juicy so premium is going to be pretty juicy so this< this is where as premium sellers we do this is where as premium sellers we do want< want to take advantage of this so I'll want to take advantage of this so I'll be< be sharing with you you know how you can be sharing with you you know how you can identify< identify such opportunities as well as identify such opportunities as well as share< share with you a trade which I did as share with you a trade which I did as well< well so well so the< the trade which I did is on the ishs the trade which I did is on the ishs Russell< Russell 2000 ETF the ticker symbol is Russell 2000 ETF the ticker symbol is iwm< iwm so basically this holds the 2000 iwm so basically this holds the 2000 small< small cap stops or rather the bottom small cap stops or rather the bottom 2000< 2000 small cap stock so in this rwm 2000 small cap stock so in this rwm there< there are some Financial stocks so of there are some Financial stocks so of all< all the index ETFs like the spiders all the index ETFs like the spiders diamonds< diamonds uh qqqs and this iwm iwm is the diamonds uh qqqs and this iwm iwm is the one< one that hit was hit the most in a sense one that hit was hit the most in a sense whereby< whereby there is a very big move in the whereby there is a very big move in the index< index ETFs right so as you can see the index ETFs right so as you can see the market< market really sold off down here market really sold off down here so< so it was a pretty big move you can see so it was a pretty big move you can see there's< there's a gap down as well and there there's a gap down as well and there were< were days that were down like two three were days that were down like two three percent< percent okay so during this time you can percent okay so during this time you can see< see that the vix have really spiked all see that the vix have really spiked all the< the way up to almost as high as 31 and the way up to almost as high as 31 and it< it started off somewhere around 20s it started off somewhere around 20s right< right even below 20s so you can see that right even below 20s so you can see that this< this candlesticks you can see the moves this candlesticks you can see the moves are< are all really very big so it's a very are all really. very big so it's a very big< big spike from where it started off and big spike from where it started off and this< this all happened in just a matter of this all happened in just a matter of few< few days so this is the time as premium few days so this is the time as premium sellers< sellers we really want to take advantage sellers we really want to take advantage of< of this right where the premium is high of this right where the premium is high it's< it's very juicy so that we can have it's very juicy so that we can have pretty< pretty quick profits when the volatility pretty quick profits when the volatility eventually< eventually contracts back down again eventually contracts back down again because< because one of the thing we know of the because one of the thing we know of the characteristics< characteristics of volatility is that it characteristics of volatility is that it is< is mean reverting right so there will be is mean reverting right so there will be spikes< spikes up and then it will come back spikes up and then it will come back down< down again and then as you can see when down again and then as you can see when the< the market is kind of uh the vix the market is kind of uh the vix volatility< volatility is is going nowhere sideways volatility is is going nowhere sideways it< it will be 10 time where it will Spike it will be 10 time where it will Spike back< back up again and after that it will back up again and after that it will come< come back down again so this is the come back down again so this is the characteristic< characteristic of the volatility it's characteristic of the volatility it's mean< mean reverting as we already know so mean reverting as we already know so that< that is why when the market presents us that is why when the market presents us such< such opportunities usually when it's such opportunities usually when it's when< when the market really tanks really when the market really tanks really crashes< crashes or all this kind of news then crashes or all this kind of news then this< this is where you can have this huge this is where you can have this huge spike< spike in the vix and then you can put on spike in the vix and then you can put on some< some trades right so the trade which I some trades right so the trade which I put< put on is a shot put right so when the put on is a shot put right so when the market< market really sold off I think somewhere market really sold off I think somewhere around< around this point down here roughly around this point down here roughly around< around 171 or so this is when I decided around 171 or so this is when I decided to< to put on a shot put so I put on the 164 to put on a shot put so I put on the 164 shot< shot put which is roughly around 25 shot put which is roughly around 25 Deltas< Deltas when I put it on and I got it for Deltas when I put it on and I got it for four< four dollars and 51 cents and that is four dollars and 51 cents and that is about< about 450 or so so you can see about 450 or so so you can see when< when I put on this trade it was pretty when I put on this trade it was pretty close< close to the previous low so this is close to the previous low so this is where< where you know usually there's some sort where you know usually there's some sort of< of support so it's a good time for me to of support so it's a good time for me to get< get into a bullish strategy and as you get into a bullish strategy and as you can< can see just very quickly in the next can see just very quickly in the next few< few days right it's almost 50 in terms few days right it's almost 50 in terms of< of the profit right I sold it for 4. 51 of the profit right I sold it for 4.

51 and< and then the Mark was somewhere around and then the Mark was somewhere around two< two dollars and 44 cents almost 50 two dollars and 44 cents almost 50 percent< percent profit and somewhere actually percent profit and somewhere actually during< during the day it was around 50 profit during the day it was around 50 profit right< right so if you wanted to take off your right so if you wanted to take off your profit< profit at 50 you could have already done profit at 50 you could have already done so< so and this is just in a matter of days so and this is just in a matter of days when< when I first put on this there was when I first put on this there was around< around 45 days right there's around 45 around 45 days right there's around 45 days< days left to expiration so this is just days left to expiration so this is just about< about three days or so and very quickly about three days or so and very quickly you< you can see you can see the< the when the volatility drops right so the when the volatility drops right so in< in the next few days most likely it's in in the next few days most likely it's in this< this candle bar down here when the this candle bar down here when the voltage< voltage drop immediately there's a huge voltage drop immediately there's a huge profit< profit right I put this on when the fix profit right I put this on when the fix was< was somewhere around 30 so I got in was somewhere around 30 so I got in somewhere< somewhere around the high of the vix and somewhere around the high of the vix and then< then when the market gaps up you can see then when the market gaps up you can see there's< there's a gap up the next day there's a gap up the next day this< this is when the volatility dropped this is when the volatility dropped right< right so this is where you can see that right so this is where you can see that there's< there's a pretty big profit in terms of there's a pretty big profit in terms of the< the shot put because the shot put as we the shot put because the shot put as we know< know has three things going for us right know has three things going for us right we< we have the positive Delta that means to we have the positive Delta that means to say< say that when the market goes up this uh say that when the market goes up this uh shot< shot put will be in profit right the shot put will be in profit right the higher< higher it goes then the more of this higher it goes then the more of this premium< premium it will it will lose more of premium it will it will lose more of this< this premium and that's where the profit this premium and that's where the profit comes< comes on comes from and then we have comes on comes from and then we have positive< positive Theta so positive Theta just positive Theta so positive Theta just means< means that over time uh the value will means that over time uh the value will start< start to Decay as well so. we have this start to Decay as well so we have this going< going for us as well and then we have going for us as well and then we have negative< negative Vega which basically is a negative Vega which basically is a profit< profit from a crush in the volatility so profit from a crush in the volatility so with< with the volatility starts to go back with the volatility starts to go back down< down this is where you have a profit down this is where you have a profit on< on your shot put as well right basically on your shot put as well right basically the< the value of the shot put will start to the value of the shot put will start to drop< drop pretty quickly when there's a drop drop pretty quickly when there's a drop in< in volatility so you can see that there in volatility so you can see that there are< are three things going for me are three things going for me simultaneously< simultaneously when the market kept up simultaneously when the market kept up right< right so when the market kept up right so when the market kept up basically< basically it's in uh it went up so I basically it's in uh it went up so I have< have made in terms of positive Delta and have made in terms of positive Delta and then< then days have passed although not many then days have passed although not many days< days have passed right but over time we days have passed right but over time we know< know that over time know that over time this< this positive Theta will be working in this positive Theta will be working in your< your favor so you're collecting a little your favor so you're collecting a little bit< bit of profit every single day as long bit of profit every single day as long as< as you're holding on to this trade and as you're holding on to this trade and then< then you have negative Vega right then you have negative Vega right negative< negative Vega when the market or rather negative Vega when the market or rather the< the doubt the the volatility starts to the doubt the the volatility starts to drop< drop so the Delta and the Vega kind of drop so the Delta and the Vega kind of Works< Works hand in hand right because when Works hand in hand right because when the< the market goes up then the volatility the market goes up then the volatility will< will drop right so this too kind of will drop right so this too kind of works< works in tandem so obviously uh the next works in tandem so obviously uh the next few< few days the market right closed on few days the market right closed on Friday< Friday uh it was somewhere around one Friday uh it was somewhere around one seven< seven one somewhere around the the place seven one somewhere around the the place where< where I first entered but then the where I first entered but then the volatility< volatility is not as high right the volatility is not as high right the volatility< volatility you can see is dropped from volatility you can see is dropped from its< its highs of around 30 plus 31 or almost its highs of around 30 plus 31 or almost 30. < 30.

so although the price is somewhere 30. so although the price is somewhere around< around the same price when I first put around the same price when I first put it< it on the position is still in a profit it on the position is still in a profit right< right it's still in a profit so you can right it's still in a profit so you can see< see this is where you can really profit see this is where you can really profit from< from such overreactions so the next from such overreactions so the next question< question you might be asking is you know question you might be asking is you know where< where do you actually place the trades where do you actually place the trades because< because this Fiasco this whole banking because this Fiasco this whole banking thing< thing has been you know it has taken thing has been you know it has taken place< place over a number of days so how do place over a number of days so how do you< you know where to put it on well the you know where to put it on well the first< first thing is if you know how to first thing is if you know how to recharge< recharge or you know how to use recharge or you know how to use technical< technical indicators you know how to technical indicators you know how to read< read support and resistance then you read support and resistance then you probably< probably would have an ideal where you probably would have an ideal where you want< want to put it right so somewhere around want to put it right so somewhere around here here here near< near the support area but what if you're near the support area but what if you're someone< someone you know who don't know how to someone you know who don't know how to recharge< recharge or you're relatively new to recharge or you're relatively new to trading< trading the markets or even just trading trading the markets or even just trading options< options then a simple way where you can options then a simple way where you can identify< identify opportunities in the market is identify opportunities in the market is by< by placing what I call the income grid by placing what I call the income grid so< so you can see the income group so you can see the income group basically< basically just by drawing levels right basically just by drawing levels right you< you have many different price levels so you have many different price levels so all< all these price levels gives you an all these price levels gives you an opportunity< opportunity to place on certain trades opportunity to place on certain trades so< so in this sense this is vertical so in this sense this is vertical diversification< diversification right so you have two diversification right so you have two types< types of diversification you have types of diversification you have horizontal< horizontal diversification so horizontal horizontal diversification so horizontal diversification< diversification is basically where you diversification is basically where you enter< enter trades into different stocks so enter trades into different stocks so let's< let's say for example your stock a Stock let's say for example your stock a Stock B< B and stock C then you enter a trade in B and stock C then you enter a trade in stock< stock a and then maybe you enter in stock a and then maybe you enter in Stock< Stock B again and then you enter into Stock B again and then you enter into stock< stock C so this way you have three stock C so this way you have three different< different stocks and you would be different stocks and you would be somewhat< somewhat Diversified but the problem somewhat Diversified but the problem with< with this diversification is that when with this diversification is that when the< the market crashes everything will start the market crashes everything will start to< to go down right stock a will go down to go down right stock a will go down Stock< Stock B will go down stock c will go Stock B will go down stock c will go down< down and when you enter it you roughly down and when you enter it you roughly entered< entered around the same price because entered around the same price because let's< let's say for example when the the index let's say for example when the the index ETF< ETF is somewhere around this point down ETF is somewhere around this point down here< here so you look to stock a so maybe you here so you look to stock a so maybe you enter< enter into Google then you enter into a enter into Google then you enter into a bullish< bullish strategy in a and then you go to bullish strategy in a and then you go to B< B maybe this would be in let's say B maybe this would be in let's say Microsoft< Microsoft then you enter a bullish trade Microsoft then you enter a bullish trade down< down here so in stock C maybe you enter down here so in stock C maybe you enter a< a bullish trade also in PNG but then a bullish trade also in PNG but then when< when the market crashes all equities when the market crashes all equities tend< tend to have pretty high correlation tend to have pretty high correlation then< then right because you can see in 2020 then right because you can see in 2020 pandemic< pandemic even in 2022 when the market pandemic even in 2022 when the market crashes< crashes they all tend to move at the crashes they all tend to move at the same< same time so when you enter the stocks same time so when you enter the stocks around< around roughly the same timing then around roughly the same timing then guess< guess what when the market crashes all guess what when the market crashes all your< your positions will be caught that is your positions will be caught that is why< why I received quite a number of emails why I received quite a number of emails you< you know people asking me say that you you know people asking me say that you know< know what should they do now because know what should they do now because their< their stocks they enter roughly towards their stocks they enter roughly towards the< the end of 2021 so any stocks that you the end of 2021 so any stocks that you end< end enter roughly around 2021 you will end enter roughly around 2021 you will be< be caught be caught because< because the market started to sell off because the market started to sell off in< in the beginning of 2022 so that's where in the beginning of 2022 so that's where the< the problem comes with horizontal the problem comes with horizontal diversification< diversification now the other form of diversification now the other form of diversification< diversification is a vertical diversification is a vertical diversification< diversification that means you can diversification that means you can actually< actually go on to just a single stock or actually go on to just a single stock or in< in this case a single index ETF which in this case a single index ETF which comprises< comprises of many different stocks and comprises of many different stocks and then< then instead of you know going to other then instead of you know going to other different< different stocks you stick to just one different stocks you stick to just one product< product or maybe just a handful of product or maybe just a handful of products< products and then you enter different products and then you enter different strategies< strategies down here so in this case strategies down here so in this case let's< let's say for example if the price goes let's say for example if the price goes down< down to 190 then you can say all right I down to 190 then you can say all. right I want< want to enter a strategy down here want to enter a strategy down here either< either bullish bearish or neutral then either bullish bearish or neutral then if< if the market goes to 185 you enter if the market goes to 185 you enter another< another strategy again and so on so another strategy again and so on so forth< forth right so as the market goes down forth right so as the market goes down right< right you have different strategies so right you have different strategies so this< this way you're really Diversified in this way you're really Diversified in terms< terms of different price levels so even terms of different price levels so even though< though the market goes down you may though the market goes down you may let's< let's say lose money or 190 if it's a let's say lose money or 190 if it's a bullish< bullish strategy but if you have a bullish strategy but if you have a bullish< bullish strategy on 175 then guess what bullish strategy on 175 then guess what then< then this chances is that if the market then this chances is that if the market was< was to recover then you would profit on was to recover then you would profit on this< this so this way your uh you are this so this way your uh you are Diversified< Diversified in terms of the different Diversified in terms of the different price< price level so this is what you call price level so this is what you call vertical< vertical diversification so you have vertical diversification so you have different< different strategies on different price different strategies on different price levels< levels at the same time you have on levels at the same time you have on different< different expiration dates as well so different expiration dates as well so this< this really smoothens out your p l this really smoothens out your p l volatility< volatility compared to if you were to do volatility compared to if you were to do horizontal< horizontal diversification so by the way horizontal diversification so by the way if< if you were to enter into Google for if you were to enter into Google for stock< stock a and then Microsoft for Stock B stock a and then Microsoft for Stock B and< and let's say you enter into Apple for and let's say you enter into Apple for stock< stock C guess what this really isn't any stock C guess what this really isn't any diversification< diversification because you are all into diversification because you are all into tech< tech stocks right so if the tech stocks tech stocks right so if the tech stocks in< in the sector was the crash all of them in the sector was the crash all of them will< will be hit so you want to diversify in will be hit so you want to diversify in terms< terms of different types of sectors terms of different types of sectors maybe< maybe you have the healthcare sector maybe you have the healthcare sector then< then you have the technology sector then then you have the technology sector then you< you have the consumer staples sector so you have the consumer staples sector so this< this way at least the crash you know this way at least the crash you know when< when the crash comes it won't be so bad when the crash comes it won't be so bad right< right a better horizontal right a better horizontal diversification< diversification will be in different diversification will be in different product< product assets let's say maybe in golds product assets let's say maybe in golds silver< silver maybe in all so this way when the silver maybe in all so this way when the market< market crashes the correlation won't be market crashes the correlation won't be that< that high right but my preferred that high right but my preferred approach< approach will be vertical approach will be vertical diversification< diversification because I don't really diversification because I don't really like< like to trade in so many different like to trade in so many different stocks< stocks at one time right some people stocks at one time right some people have< have asked me you know how do you search have asked me you know how do you search for< for the different stocks to enter well for the different stocks to enter well the< the thing is I don't really do that the thing is I don't really do that right< right I just have a watch list a handful right I just have a watch list a handful of< of watch list about 10 stocks or so of watch list about 10 stocks or so comprising< comprising mostly of index ETFs and then comprising mostly of index ETFs and then I< I just look at them right I don't keep I just look at them right I don't keep looking< looking for the new stocks or the new looking for the new stocks or the new horror< horror stocks that's in play so this way horror stocks that's in play so this way every< every day I just look at them and then I every day I just look at them and then I look< look at my income grid I look at the look at my income grid I look at the price< price levels so when you look at these price levels so when you look at these price< price levels this income grid it price levels this income grid it presents< presents you with four different choices presents you with four different choices right< right at each of these levels you have right at each of these levels you have an< an opportunity to do one of four things an opportunity to do one of four things right< right the first is that you can place a right the first is that you can place a bullish< bullish strategy right bullish strategy bullish strategy right bullish strategy maybe< maybe you want to place a shot put or maybe you want to place a shot put or maybe< maybe a bull put spread bull call spread maybe a bull put spread bull call spread any< any of this bullish strategy you can put any of this bullish strategy you can put on< on right the next choice you have would on right the next choice you have would be< be a bearish strategy right very be a bearish strategy right very strategy< strategy maybe you have a bad call strategy maybe you have a bad call spread< spread or maybe a debit put spread like spread or maybe a debit put spread like the< the bad put spread and then you have the the bad put spread and then you have the neutral< neutral strategy so let's say maybe you neutral strategy so let's say maybe you think< think that the market might be going think that the market might be going sideways< sideways then you might want to put on sideways then you might want to put on an< an iron Condor maybe a butterfly or even an iron Condor maybe a butterfly or even a< a strangle if your Capital allows you a strangle if your Capital allows you have< have a bigger size trading account and have a bigger size trading account and last< last but not least you have obviously last but not least you have obviously the< the choice to do nothing as well right the choice to do nothing as well right there's< there's no need for you to force a trade there's no need for you to force a trade if< if you don't see an opportunity there or if you don't see an opportunity there or you< you don't have any view or bias on the you don't have any view or bias on the underlying< underlying stock right so for example in underlying stock right so for example in this< this case let's say the market first this case let's say the market first trade< trade off to 195.

so at 195 you can see trade off to 195. so at 195 you can see that< that the market has been extended the that the market has been extended the first< first time it goes to 195 so you might first time it goes to 195 so you might say< say to yourself you know I'm pretty say to yourself you know I'm pretty bearish< bearish on this so I might want to place bearish on this so I might want to place a< a battery strategy down here so if you a battery strategy down here so if you place< place a bearish strategy down here maybe place a bearish strategy down here maybe you< you say that all right I want to place a you say that all right I want to place a bear< bear call strategy so you might place a bear call strategy so you might place a back< back call right bear calls basically you back call right bear calls basically you you< you sell one call option file the money you sell one call option file the money and< and then further out you buy back and then further out you buy back another< another call option to this way you have another call option to this way you have a< a bad call strategy on 195 so when the a bad call strategy on 195 so when the market< market starts to go down all right it market starts to go down all right it comes< comes to 190 then you might say oh I'm comes to 190 then you might say oh I'm still< still bearish on this then you can enter still bearish on this then you can enter another< another bear called spread or maybe this another bear called spread or maybe this time< time you might be saying you know I'm time you might be saying you know I'm somewhat< somewhat neutral maybe it looks like somewhat neutral maybe it looks like it's< it's going to go sideways I think it may it's going to go sideways I think it may go< go sideways from here there I'm going to go sideways from here there I'm going to place< place a neutral strategy right so you place a neutral strategy right so you can< can see you have a variety of different can see you have a variety of different strategies< strategies that you can place on as the strategies that you can place on as the market< market moves so if the market comes down market moves so if the market comes down here< here again you might say that all right here again you might say that all right at< at 185 maybe I'm neutral again I place at 185 maybe I'm neutral again I place another< another neutral strategy and then when another neutral strategy and then when there's< there's this huge move down there's this huge move down and< and then there's a spike in volatility and then there's a spike in volatility you< you might say all right maybe this is you might say all right maybe this is time< time I'm I'm feeling a little bit time I'm I'm feeling a little bit bullish< bullish I'm thinking that there's going bullish I'm thinking that there's going to< to be a step back in terms of the price to be a step back in terms of the price then< then guess what I'm gonna place a then guess what I'm gonna place a bullish< bullish strategy down here and as the bullish strategy down here and as the market< market goes down the volatility is too market goes down the volatility is too high< high then I may want to place another high then I may want to place another bullish< bullish strategy again then when the bullish strategy again then when the market< market recovers back up and you might be market recovers back up and you might be having< having a position on steel right because having a position on steel right because maybe< maybe only a few days have passed since maybe only a few days have passed since you< you place this then this is the time you place this then this is the time where< where you can basically do nothing right where you can basically do nothing right there's< there's no need for you to force a trade there's no need for you to force a trade if< if you already have a trade on for this if you already have a trade on for this level< level so basically all you're doing is level so basically all you're doing is you're< you're diversifying in terms of you're diversifying in terms of different< different price levels different different price levels different strategies< strategies and you also have different strategies and you also have different maturity< maturity dates different days to maturity dates different days to expiration< expiration for each of this strategy so expiration for each of this strategy so in< in this way you really have a very in this way you really have a very Diversified< Diversified kind of uh options portfolio Diversified kind of uh options portfolio rather< rather than you know you put on a b and rather than you know you put on a b and c< c same kind of strategy and then they c same kind of strategy and then they all< all crash at the same time because you all crash at the same time because you all< all roughly have at around the same all roughly have at around the same price< price level so in this way you are going price level so in this way you are going to< to have a much more smoother p l to have a much more smoother p l volatility< volatility that means you you will volatility that means you you will notice< notice that on certain trades you will notice that on certain trades you will lose< lose certain trades you will make lose certain trades you will make because< because you are all at different price because you are all at different price levels< levels and different maturity days so if levels and different maturity days so if the< the price let's say for example from 175 the price let's say for example from 175 it< it goes up to 185 right if it goes to it goes up to 185 right if it goes to 185< 185 at this point all right let me just 185 at this point all right let me just remove< remove all the drawings to make it very remove all the drawings to make it very clear< clear so let's say at 185 clear so let's say at 185 so< so what would happen is this right maybe so what would happen is this right maybe you< you will lose money on the 190 let's say you will lose money on the 190 let's say if< if you have a bullish trade on but. then if you have a bullish trade on

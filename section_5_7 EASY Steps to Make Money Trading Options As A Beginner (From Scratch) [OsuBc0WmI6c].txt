course I would assume that you< you at least have the basic Foundation you at least have the basic Foundation of< of options that means you know at least of options that means you know at least what's< what's the calls and puts and then we what's the calls and puts and then we will< will begin from there so what I've done will begin from there so what I've done for< for this video is that I've have uh laid for this video is that I've have uh laid out< out a number of steps for you to go out a number of steps for you to go through< through and I wanted to keep things through and I wanted to keep things really< really simple and it will give you the really simple and it will give you the best< best chance of succeeding in options best chance of succeeding in options trading< trading all right so let's get into the trading all right so let's get into the very< very first step so step one and that is very first step so step one and that is to< to choose just one option strategy right to choose just one option strategy right too< too many times many people come into too many times many people come into options< options trading especially you know if options trading especially you know if they're< they're just starting out and then they they're just starting out and then they are< are flooded with so many of this option are flooded with so many of this option strategies< strategies they get so excited right strategies they get so excited right they< they see one they like it they go for they see one they like it they go for that< that one they see another one they like that one they see another one they like it< it as well they go for that and at the it as well they go for that and at the end< end of the day you have a like a mix of end of the day you have a like a mix of so< so many different strategies and they so many different strategies and they get< get so confused and they don't get the get so confused and they don't get the kind< kind of results right so one of the kind of results right so one of the biggest< biggest stps that many beginners fall biggest stps that many beginners fall into< into when they first get into options into when they first get into options trading< trading is to trade too many option trading is to trade too many option strategies< strategies at one time not only does strategies at one time not only does this< this overwhelm you but it also lets you this overwhelm you but it also lets you feel< feel very confused as to which one you feel very confused as to which one you should< should be using at which time so instead should be using at which time so instead of< of going for too many option strategies of going for too many option strategies what< what I like you to do is right now at what I like you to do is right now at the< the start just choose one strategy to the start just choose one strategy to focus< focus on right just one strategy stick focus on right just one strategy stick with< with it until you've mastered it and with it until you've mastered it and there's< there's no reason why you cannot just there's no reason why you cannot just choose< choose one strategy and then be choose one strategy and then be profitable< profitable with it so you might be profitable with it so you might be asking< asking right now so Davis there are so asking right now so Davis there are so many< many option strategies in the options many option strategies in the options trading< trading world which one should I choose trading world which one should I choose so< so I'm going to give you a number of so I'm going to give you a number of strategies< strategies down here but I want you to strategies down here but I want you to just< just pick one right just pick one out of just pick one right just pick one out of this< this uh five I'm going to share with you this uh five I'm going to share with you and< and you want to see which of the ones and you want to see which of the ones kind< kind of suit your characteristic the kind of suit your characteristic the most< most all right so the very first one is most all right so the very first one is the< the ever popular wheel strategy right so the. ever popular wheel strategy right so wheel< wheel strategy can be a good strategy to wheel strategy can be a good strategy to begin< begin with because it's really really begin with because it's really really simple< simple right in the sense whereby you simple right in the sense whereby you really< really only have to deal with just one really only have to deal with just one option< option L at any given time so for option L at any given time so for example< example the wheel strategy how it starts example the wheel strategy how it starts off< off is by selling this cash secure put off is by selling this cash secure put now< now remember when you're trading the whe now remember when you're trading the whe strategy< strategy the whole idea here the strategy the whole idea here the intention< intention here is to get assigned on the intention here is to get assigned on the underlying< underlying shares right the underlying underlying shares right the underlying stock< stock that means to say if the market stock that means to say if the market actually< actually comes into Cash secure putut actually comes into Cash secure putut don't< don't try too many things to try and don't try too many things to try and save< save it or thinking you're going to lose save it or thinking you're going to lose money< money right because the whole idea here money right because the whole idea here is< is that this this cash outut is meant is that this this cash outut is meant for< for you to just get the credit and if it for you to just get the credit and if it goes< goes below this is where you want to get goes below this is where you want to get assigned< assigned and get into the shares right assigned and get into the shares right so< so if it goes below your cash secure so if it goes below your cash secure output< output at expiration then this is where output at expiration then this is where you're< you're going to be long a00 shares and you're going to be long a00 shares and then< then from here very simple as well you then from here very simple as well you just< just have to find the right timing to just have to find the right timing to sell< sell the cover call so the cover call sell the cover call so the cover call some< some people want to sell it exactly at some people want to sell it exactly at where< where you know they got assigned the 100 where you know they got assigned the 100 shares< shares you can do that my preference shares you can do that my preference would< would actually be to sell the cover call would actually be to sell the cover call above< above where you get 100 shares this way above where you get 100 shares this way if< if the market goes up not only do you if the market goes up not only do you get< get the premium from the cash SEC putut get the premium from the cash SEC putut and< and the cover call you also get the and the cover call you also get the capital< capital gains right the difference from capital gains right the difference from where< where you are long the 100 shares to where you are long the 100 shares to where< where you are being called away from where you are being called away from your< your cover call right so as you can see your cover call right so as you can see here< here it is pretty simple just one here it is pretty simple just one strategy< strategy at a time now one thing about strategy at a time now one thing about the< the wheel strategy though when the wheel strategy though when considering< considering whether this is for you is considering whether this is for you is that< that number one you have to be pretty that number one you have to be pretty good< good at the stock selection because if good at the stock selection because if you< you were to get assigned on the shares you were to get assigned on the shares and< and if the stock just continues to go and if the stock just continues to go all< all the way down and it never recovers all the way down and it never recovers then< then guess what you'll be stuck in a then guess what you'll be stuck in a very< very long-term position and the whole very long-term position and the whole operation< operation of this viel strategy it's operation of this viel strategy it's just< just not going to be a profitable one just not going to be a profitable one although< although you're just getting the premium although you're just getting the premium right< right so stock selection is very right so stock selection is very important< important now the other thing is that important now the other thing is that it's< it's pretty Capital intensive right so it's pretty Capital intensive right so who< who is this for it's for you if you have who is this for it's for you if you have quite< quite a bit of capital and you don't quite a bit of capital and you don't mind< mind holding on to shares for the mid to mind holding on to shares for the mid to long< long term so how exactly do you trade long term so how exactly do you trade the< the wheel strategy well that's a good the wheel strategy well that's a good question< question because I have already created question because I have already created a< a ultimate real strategy training a ultimate real strategy training program< program just for you it's about 2. 5 program just for you it's about 2.

5 hours< hours long so go to my channel and hours long so go to my channel and search< search for this right the Ultimate Wheel search for this right the Ultimate Wheel strategy< strategy C for beginners I've packed a strategy C for beginners I've packed a lot< lot of information inside here lot of information inside here especially< especially also how I trade the wheel especially also how I trade the wheel strategy< strategy my own variation of the wheel strategy my own variation of the wheel strategy< strategy so definitely go to my Chann strategy so definitely go to my Chann you< you know go and watch that all right the you know go and watch that all right the next< next strategy is the bull put spread so next strategy is the bull put spread so from< from here on we are getting into what I from here on we are getting into what I call< call the income strategies and by the call the income strategies and by the income< income strategies what I just mean is income strategies what I just mean is that< that our aim here is really to just that our aim here is really to just trade< trade the options without getting trade the options without getting assigned< assigned on the shares right so no assigned on the shares right so no getting< getting into the shares as much as getting into the shares as much as possible< possible so this is also where you possible so this is

spread spread and that is the bare call spread so< so the bare call spread basically is so the bare call spread basically is just< just the exact opposite of the bull put just the exact opposite of the bull put spread< spread and the typical win rate should spread and the typical win rate should be< be also very similar now this also be also very similar now this also really< really depends on the underlying that really depends on the underlying that you< you choose if you choose an underlying you choose if you choose an underlying that< that is very fundamentally strong right that is very fundamentally strong right if< if the market keeps going up over the if the market keeps going up over the long< long term then of course you're going to long term then of course you're going to be<

ever need so spread trading cost you ever need so definitely< definitely again go over to my channel definitely again go over to my channel search< search for this you will find a very search for this you will find a very in-depth< in-depth training on credit spreads now in-depth training on credit spreads now the< the fourth strategy is the iron Condor the fourth strategy is the iron Condor so< so this is where we get into many leg so this is where we get into many leg strategies< strategies right this is what you call a strategies right this is what you call a multi-legged< multi-legged option strategies where multi-legged option strategies where there< there are four options that you really there are four options that you really need< need to know how to put on right so the need to know how to put on right so the iron< iron Condor is a neutral strategy iron Condor is a neutral strategy whereby< whereby you don't want the market to go whereby you don't want the market to go too< too far up you don't want the market to too far up you don't want the market to go< go too far down you just want it to stay go too far down you just want it to stay within< within this range over here right as within this range over here right as long< long as it stays somewhere within the long as it stays somewhere within the range< range then you'll be profitable and it range then you'll be

this for so if you're the it so who is this for so if you're the kind< kind of person that you know you don't kind of person that you know you don't want< want to pick a direction and you just want to pick a direction and you just want< want to play The Edge whereby the realiz want to play The Edge whereby the realiz move< move is most often the time lesser than move is most often the time lesser than the< the expected move so if you're wondering the expected move so if you're wondering what< what this is right this is actually an what this is right this is actually an edge< edge that we have in options trading edge that we have in options trading right< right it's a hard Edge that we have that right it's a hard Edge that we have that you< you can use it utilize it to have you you can use it utilize it to have you know< know positive results over the long term know positive results over the long term right< right again it's always over the long right again it's always over the long term< term not just over a span of like 5 10 term not just over a span of like 5 10 trades< trades really you want to look for over trades really you want to look for over 100< 100 trades for this Edge to eventually 100 trades for this Edge to eventually play< play out so this is what we call the play out so this is what we call the edge< edge in options realize move lesser than edge in options realize move lesser than the< the expected move so if you're somebody the expected move so if you're somebody that< that just want to trade the expected that just want to trade the expected move< move you don't want to bother about you move you don't want to bother about you know< know seeing whether it's uh too far up know seeing whether it's uh too far up and< and then you want to short it or the and then you want to short it or the market< market has gone too far down and you market has gone too far down and you want< want to go long then you go for the iron want to go long then you go for the iron Condor< Condor and again I have a in-depth Condor and again I have a in-depth training< training on the iron Condor on my training on the iron Condor on my channel< channel as well yeah I call it the most channel as well yeah I call it the most in-depth< in-depth iron Condor training for in-depth iron Condor training for beginners< beginners it's about 4 hours long if you beginners it's about 4 hours long if you haven't< haven't watched it yet definitely go to haven't watched it yet definitely go to my< my channel and you'll learn exactly how my channel and. you'll learn exactly how to< to construct it when to put it on and to construct it when to put it on and also< also the underlying that you should also the underlying that you should choose< choose when you're trading the I condo choose when you're trading the I condo now< now last but not least the final option now last but not least the final option strategy< strategy that you can choose from would strategy that you can choose from would be< be called the put broken wing butterfly be called the put broken wing butterfly so< so the put broken wing butterfly as you so the put broken wing butterfly as you can< can see is this structure over here so can see is this structure over here so what< what it essentially is is just a put what it essentially is is just a put credit< credit spread that is financing a put credit spread that is financing a put debit< debit spread right so this put brokering debit spread right so this put brokering butterfly< butterfly has a pretty high win rate oh butterfly has a pretty high win rate oh yes< yes I forgot to mention about the win yes I forgot to mention about the win rate< rate of the iron Condor the iron Condor rate of the iron Condor the iron Condor typically< typically has a lower RN rate compared typically has a lower RN rate compared to< to the credit spreads right mainly to the credit spreads right mainly because< because you have you know you're being because you have you know you're being cornered< cornered on both side in the sense right cornered on both side in the sense right you're< you're being uh caged in or boxed in you're being uh caged in or boxed in from< from both sides so your win rate is from both sides so your win rate is slightly< slightly lower at around 65% again slightly lower at around 65% again really< really depending on how you choose the really depending on how you choose the Deltas< Deltas now but for the put broken wing Deltas now but for the put broken wing butterfly< butterfly this is where you can have the butterfly this is where you can have the highest< highest win rate out of the four income highest win rate out of the four income strategies< strategies that I've shared down here strategies that I've shared down here right< right so these four are the income right so these four are the income strategy< strategy so the P broking butterfly strategy so the P broking butterfly typically< typically can have a win rate of above typically can have a win rate of above 80%< 80% certain cases can also go up to 90% 80% certain cases can also go up to 90% so< so this strategy down here is what I so this strategy down here is what I call< call a pretty defensive strategy in a call a pretty defensive strategy in a sense< sense whereby we actually do want the sense whereby we actually do want the market< market to come down right because the market to come down right because the place< place where you're going to have the place where you're going to have the most< most profit really is if the market most profit really is if the market comes< comes down to this two short puts down comes down to this two short puts down here< here when you pin this short strike down here when you pin this short strike down here< here this is where you're going to make here this is where you're going to make the< the most of this option strategy so this the most of this option strategy so this is< is where you know if the market goes up is where you know if the market goes up you< you do not lose any money because you you do not lose any money because you still< still have some minimum credit for you still have some minimum credit for you to< to earn but if the market comes down to earn but if the market comes down this< this is where you're actually looking this is where you're actually looking forward< forward to uh it getting into what I forward to uh it getting into what I call< call the tent so if you take a look at call the tent so if you take a look at the< the put broker wing butterfly it would the put broker wing butterfly it would look< look something like this on the p&amp;l look something like this on the p&amp;l graph< graph and let's just say maybe the graph and let's just say maybe the market< market is somewhere around here this is market is somewhere around here this is where< where the market price is and as you can where the market price is and as you can see< see we do want the market to come down see we do want the market to come down and< and this is where the Pinnacle of the 10 and this is where the Pinnacle of the 10 is< is right I call this ship down here the is right I call this ship down here the tent< tent so you want the market to come down tent so you want the market to come down to< to actually be able to mix the most out to actually be able to mix the most out of< of this option strategy so who is this of this option strategy so who is this put< put broken wing butterfly for so if you put broken wing butterfly for so if you want< want to trade an omnidirectional want to trade an omnidirectional strategy< strategy and by that what I mean is that strategy and by that what I mean is that there< there are multiple ways for you to make there are multiple ways for you to make uh< uh profit in this strategy is that if uh profit in this strategy is that if the< the market goes up you still get a the market goes up you still get a minimum< minimum credit if the market goes minimum credit if the market goes sideways< sideways depending on you know how you sideways depending on you know how you construct< construct it if it goes below this long construct it if it goes below this long putut< putut you're going to have more than the putut you're going to have more than the minimum< minimum profit and if it goes down as minimum profit and if it goes down as well< well you're going to be in a bigger well you're going to be in a bigger profit< profit as well inside the 10 now of profit as well inside the 10 now of course< course we don't want it to go way down course we don't want it to go way down below< below our protective long putut down below our protective long putut down here< here because if that's the case then we here because if that's the case then we can< can possibly lose money as well so can possibly lose money as well so remember< remember there are no strategies that remember there are no strategies that you're< you're going to get like a 100% win rate you're going to get like a 100% win rate at< at least not inside this income at least not inside this income strategies< strategies where you're just trading strategies where you're just trading options< options but it's a pretty high win rate options but it's a pretty high win rate so< so if you want an omnidirectional St so if you want an omnidirectional St strategy< strategy with a pretty high bring rate strategy with a pretty high bring rate that< that aims to capture profits if the that aims to capture profits if the market< market goes down then the put broken market goes down then the put broken wing< wing butterfly is for you so there we wing butterfly is for you so there we have< have it right you have the five option have it right you have the five option strategies< strategies down here I want you to just strategies down here I want you to just pick< pick one of this one of this that you pick one of this one of this that you think< think is going to be most suited to your think is going to be most suited to your characteristic< characteristic the way that you like to characteristic the way that you like to trade< trade and then Master it right just trade and then Master it right just stick< stick with it so how do you trade the stick with it so how do you trade the put< put broken wing butterfly so I have put broken wing butterfly so I have created< created a video on this so I label it created a video on this so I label it the< the safest of option strategy for the safest of option strategy for beginners< beginners if you haven't seen it yet beginners if you haven't seen it yet definitely< definitely go over to my channel and definitely go over to my channel and watch< watch this video because I'm going to watch this video because I'm going to explain< explain exactly how you can put this on explain exactly how you can put this on okay< okay so this is for step one now step okay so this is for step one now step two< two this is where you start to create two this is where you start to create your< your watch list for the strategy that your watch list for the strategy that you< you have chosen so remember each you have chosen so remember each strategy< strategy is going to be pretty unique strategy is going to be pretty unique and< and I'm just going to give you a and I'm just going to give you a guideline< guideline as to how you're going to guideline as to how you're going to choose< choose the underlying for each of the choose the underlying for each of the strategies< strategies right so basically you want strategies right so basically you want to< to look out for the one that you have to look out for the one that you have chosen< chosen because each of these strategies chosen because each of these strategies kind< kind of rely on slightly different types kind of rely on slightly different types of< of underlying to trade right which one of underlying to trade right which one is< is suitable so remember strategy is one is suitable so remember strategy is one thing< thing right but you need to pair the thing right but you need to pair the strategy< strategy with the right underlying only strategy with the right underlying only when< when these two passs well together then when these two passs well together then you< you can have a positive result over the you can have a positive result over the long< long term if you have the good strategy long term if you have the good strategy but< but you have the wrong underlying then but you have the wrong underlying then guess< guess what no matter what you do it's guess what no matter what you do it's not< not going to be profitable over the long not going to be profitable over the long run< run okay so here are the stock selection run okay so here are the stock selection for< for each of the strategies that I've for each of the strategies that I've just< just shared by the way

fundamentally strong stocks now what< what about the bull put spread so the what about the bull put spread so the bull< bull put spread is bullish strategy we bull put spread is bullish strategy we want< want the market to go up so same thing want the market to go up so same thing as< as well I would also suggest to trade as well I would also suggest to trade fundamentally< fundamentally strong stocks and also the fundamentally strong stocks and also the broad-based< broad-based index ETFs right because if broad-based index ETFs right because if you< you were to trade the broad-based index you were to trade the broad-based index ETFs< ETFs right mainly the US broad-based ETFs right mainly the US broad-based index< index ETFs like the Spy qq's rwm Diamond index ETFs like the Spy qq's rwm Diamond so< so on and so forth these are all what I so on and so forth these are all what I call< call the positive drift vehicle that call the positive drift vehicle that means< means to say the market wants to keep means to say the market wants to keep going< going up in the long term so if you want going up in the long term so if you want to< to trade the bullo spread it really to trade the bullo spread it really helps< helps that you trade an underlying that helps that you trade an underlying that at< at least in the long term has a greater at least in the long term has a greater chance< chance of it going up then you know chance of it going up then you know having< having it no idea what it does right it having it no idea what it does right it goes< goes sideways or go go down right for goes sideways or go go down right for example< example if you trade stocks like example if you trade stocks like AMC< AMC then good luck to you right you're AMC then good luck to you right you're in< in for a root shock if the market in for a root shock if the market suddenly< suddenly plunges so bu push sprad on suddenly plunges so bu push sprad on fundamentally< fundamentally strong stocks and index fundamentally strong stocks and index ETFs< ETFs now what about bare call spread so ETFs now what about bare call spread so remember< remember for wheel strategy and bull put remember for wheel strategy and bull put spread< spread we want the market to go up so spread we want the market to go up so that< that is why we generally trade you know that is why we generally trade you know underlyings< underlyings that want to go up over the underlyings that want to go up over the long< long term fundamentally strong stocks long term fundamentally strong stocks broad-based< broad-based index ETFs but what about broad-based index ETFs but what about back< back call spread bare call spread is a back call spread bare call spread is a bearish< bearish strategy where we want the bearish strategy where we want the market< market to actually go down so this is market to actually go down so this is where< where I wouldn't suggest to put on the where I wouldn't suggest to put on the fundamentally< fundamentally strong stocks or maybe fundamentally strong stocks or maybe even< even the index ETFs right so it really even the index ETFs right so it really depends< depends on how you want to trade it but depends on how you want to trade it but basically< basically I would say nonf fundamentally basically I would say nonf fundamentally strong< strong stocks index ETFs you can strong stocks index ETFs you can but< but you really have to pick your spots but you really have to pick your spots well< well so if you want to play it safer in well so if you want to play it safer in the< the sense whereby you know uh you want the sense whereby you know uh you want the< the bare call spread to kind of work out the bare call spread to kind of work out then< then probably you can go for those kind then probably you can go for those kind of< of stocks that is not fundamentally of stocks that is not fundamentally strong< strong that means there is no sense of strong that means there is no sense of whether< whether is it going to go up over the whether is it going to go up over the long< long term because they have a is a long term because they have a is a profitable< profitable company well most likely profitable company well most likely you're< you're going to choose companies that you're going to choose companies that are< are not profitable because this way you are not profitable because this way you know< know that the stocks can go side way so know that the stocks can go side way so there< there are a lot of choices for this there are a lot of choices for this right< right in this case back call spread can right in this case back call spread can be< be virtually most of the stocks in the be virtually most of the stocks in the uh< uh stock market because most of the uh stock market because most of the stocks< stocks in the US Stock Market well a lot stocks in the US Stock Market well a lot of< of it are not fundamentally strong of it are not fundamentally strong stocks< stocks so these are the candidates for stocks so these are the candidates for be< be spread now what about the iron Condor be spread now what about the iron Condor so< so for the IR condo remember we want to so for the IR condo remember we want to trade< trade the expected move and for this I trade the expected move and for this I really< really want to choose an underline that really want to choose an underline that is< is not too volatile I don't want it to is not too volatile I don't want it to keep< keep moving all the way up or all the keep moving all the way up or all the way< way down especially I don't want to get way down especially I don't want to get into< into those situations where there's an into those situations where there's an earning< earning coming or some unexpected news earning coming or some unexpected news of< of the company that will make a very of the company that will make a very huge< huge move in the underline so for this I huge move in the underline so for this I would< would suggest index ETFs because index would suggest index ETFs because index ETFs< ETFs you don't have to worry about ETFs you don't have to worry about earnings< earnings at the same time the volatility earnings at the same time the volatility is< is generally lower compared to is generally lower compared to individual< individual stocks because you have a individual stocks because you have a basket< basket of stocks right sometimes you can basket of stocks right sometimes you can see< see certain index ETFs that carry an see certain index ETFs that carry an underlying< underlying let's say a single stock and underlying let's say a single stock and the< the single stock has a huge move maybe the single stock has a huge move maybe it< it moves like 30% If It Moves 30% if you it moves like 30% If It Moves 30% if you take< take a look at the index ETF that take a look at the index ETF that actually< actually carries it right the actually carries it right the broad-based< broad-based ones chances are that it may broad-based ones chances are that it may not< not even move that much right maybe even not even move that much right maybe even less< less than a percent so these are very less than a percent so these are very good< good for iron Condor because in the good for iron Condor because in the first< first place we are only trading the first place we are only trading the expected< expected move we don't want the market expected move we don't want the market to< to move that much now finally what about to move that much now finally what about the< the put broken wing butterfly what kind the put broken wing butterfly what kind of< of underlying should you choose to trade of underlying should you choose to trade the< the put broker wing butterfly so for the the put broker wing butterfly so for the put< put broker wing butterfly I would put broker wing butterfly I would suggest< suggest to trade the cash settle index suggest to trade the cash settle index options< options because this is a pretty slow options because this is a pretty slow spread< spread and at times you can actually spread and at times you can actually hold< hold all the way to expiration now I hold all the way to expiration now I know< know some people will prefer to cut it know some people will prefer to cut it out< out at 50% or 25% this really is up to out at 50% or 25% this really is up to you< you right you can definitely do that but you right you can definitely do that but I< I think that the cash sh index options I think that the cash sh index options would< would be a good way to trade the put would be a good way to trade the put broker< broker wing butterfly because we broker wing butterfly because we actually< actually want the market to come down to actually want the market to come down to where< where our shut is and if you were to where our shut is and if you were to trade< trade this on those uh index ETFs or trade this on those uh index ETFs or individual< individual stocks these are American sty individual stocks these are American sty options< options then you could possibly get options then you could possibly get assigned< assigned on the shares even before it assigned on the shares even before it reaches< reaches expiration right so this is reaches expiration right so this is something< something to really keep in mind of when something to really keep in mind of when you're< you're training the put program you're training the put program butterfly< butterfly okay so this is step two now butterfly okay so this is step two now let's< let's get into step three so for step let's get into step three so for step three< three this is where you want to set up three this is where you want to set up your< your chart right get your chart ready to your chart right get your chart ready to start< start trading the option strategy so for start trading the option strategy so for me< me I like to keep my chart very clean me I like to keep my chart very clean and< and simple with at most just two and simple with at most just two indicators< indicators right as you can see over indicators right as you can see over here< here on the right hand side I only have here on the right hand side I only have two< two indicators on right you have the two indicators on right you have the moving< moving average which is the purple line moving average which is the purple line on< on top and then you have the stochastic on top and then you have the stochastic oscillator< oscillator which is below so the moving oscillator which is below so the moving average< average I don't really use it at all to average I don't really use it at all to you< you know determine whether the market is you know determine whether the market is time< time for me to enter into a certain time for me to enter into a certain trade< trade or not rather the moving average I trade or not rather the moving average I just< just put it on just to have a general just put it on just to have a general sense< sense of the direction right is it sense of the direction right is it generally< generally trending upwards or downwards generally trending upwards or downwards or< or going sideways but moving average is or going sideways but moving average is not< not that very important especially when not that very important especially when we're< we're trading uh the options trading for we're trading uh the options trading for slightly< slightly longer term so you can choose slightly longer term so you can choose to< to put on the moving average if you want to put on the moving average if you want to< to if you want to then just go for like to if you want to then just go for like the< the 100 EMA or SMA right that's pretty the 100 EMA or SMA right that's pretty much< much what I put on and finally for the much what I put on and finally for the last< last indicator would just be the last indicator would just be the stochastic< stochastic oscillator or the RSI so this stochastic oscillator or the RSI so this is< is just a way for us to identify either is just a way for us to identify either overbought< overbought or over so conditions in the overbought or over so conditions in the market< market and this would really help us market and this would really help us time< time the entry much better for the time the entry much better for the strategies< strategies that we are using right not strategies that we are using right not all< all of them we necessarily have to use all of them we necessarily have to use it< it but for most of them right this can it but for most of them right this can be< be a helpful tool right remember it's be a helpful tool right remember it's just< just an indication of the underlying just an indication of the underlying Market< Market condition doesn't mean that it's Market condition doesn't mean that it's guaranteed< guaranteed it's going to work out all guaranteed it's going to work out all the< the time right so for example if the the time right so for example if the market< market is overs it should go below the market is overs it should go below the line< line it lets you at least get into the line it lets you at least get into the strategy< strategy whereby you know there's a strategy whereby you know there's a higher< higher likelihood the market will go up higher likelihood the market will go up then< then it continue to go down right so for then it continue to go down right so for this< this overs reading you can put on this overs reading you can put on bullish< bullish strategies for example the wheel bullish strategies for example the wheel strategy< strategy will be one of them when you're strategy will be one of them when you're putting< putting on the cash cut putut and also putting on the cash cut putut and also the< the bull put spread right you could also the bull put spread right you could also optionally< optionally you could also use it for the optionally you could also use it for the put< put broken wing butterfly right so these put broken wing butterfly right so these are< are ways for you to identify the are ways for you to identify the condition< condition of the market next one is the condition of the market next one is the overboard< overboard now the overboard now of overboard now the overboard now of course< course this will be where you use the course this will be where you use the bare< bare call spread because you want it to bare call spread because you want it to be< be a bearish signal where you want the be a bearish signal where you want the market< market to goes down so this is where you market to goes down so this is where you look< look at the indicator to see if it's look at the indicator to see if it's overbought< overbought right then you start to look overbought right then you start to look for< for potential setups or entries for the for potential setups or entries for the B< B call spread and the other one would be B call spread and the other one would be the< the cover call for the wheel strategy the cover call for the wheel strategy because< because once you get into the stock and because once you get into the stock and some< some people want to actually hold on to some people want to actually hold on to the< the stock right the shares as the market the stock right the shares as the market goes< goes up you can wait until it's goes up you can wait until it's overboard< overboard and then you sell the cover overboard and then you sell the cover call< call right this way if the market is call right this way if the market is overboard< overboard and you sell the cover call overboard and you sell the cover call there's< there's a you know at least a greater there's a you know at least a greater likelihood< likelihood for the market to come down likelihood for the market to come down after< after that you earn the cover call your after that you earn the cover call your share< share still being held in your it share still being held in your it doesn't< doesn't get CAU away now what about for doesn't get CAU away now what about for the< the iron Condor so generally for the the iron Condor so generally for the iron< iron Condor we don't really need the iron Condor we don't really need the stochastic< stochastic indicator whatsoever or even stochastic indicator whatsoever or even the< the moving average because we are purely the moving average because we are purely trading< trading the expected move but in certain trading the expected move but in certain cases< cases you can actually just see if the cases you can actually just see if the market< market is neither overbought or oversold market is neither overbought or oversold then< then this way somewhere in the middle then this way somewhere in the middle you< you can consider to put on the iron you can consider to put on the iron Condor< Condor now of course not necessary for Condor now of course not necessary for you< you to do that but you can do that if you to do that but you can do that if you< you want to so this is just how I set up you want to so this is just how I set up the< the chart as you can see very simple the chart as you can see very simple very< very clean please don't put on like 3 very clean please don't put on like 3 four< four 5 6 seven indicators that you you four 5 6 seven indicators that you you get< get so confused no idea what to look at get so confused no idea what to look at right< right so this is step three let's move right so this is step three let's move on< on to step four which is the most on to step four which is the most important< important one all of all the steps that important one all of all the steps that I< I mentioned here if you want to be able I mentioned here if you want to be able to< to trade properly and that is to plan to trade properly and that is to plan your< your exit scenarios the biggest mistake your exit scenarios the biggest mistake that< that many people make when training that many people make when training options< options is not planning their exit options is not planning their exit scenars< scenars for example many time when they scenars for example many time when they get< get into the trade they have no idea get into the trade they have no idea what< what they're going to do if the market what they're going to do if the market is< is going to move against the positions is going to move against the positions most< most of the time when they enter into most of the time when they enter into the< the position they just look at you know the position they just look at you know oh< oh this is how much money I can make and oh this is how much money I can make and they< they only think about the scenario they only think about the scenario whereby< whereby it works out for them but when whereby it works out for them but when the< the market makes a very big move against the market makes a very big move against them< them right for example recently we had them right for example recently we had the< the unwinding of the Yen carry trade and the unwinding of the. Yen carry trade and that< that shocked a lot of people because that shocked a lot of people because there< there was a huge move and because you there was a huge move and because you didn't< didn't plan for it or for those people didn't plan for it or for those people who< who didn't plan for this exit scenario who didn't plan for this exit scenario they< they were lost right they have no idea they were lost right they have no idea what< what to do and they panic and they made what to do and they panic and they made a< a lot of mistakes so this is where you a lot of mistakes so this is where you really< really need to know what your exit really need to know what your exit scenarios< scenarios are before you enter into a scenarios are before you enter into a trade< trade right after you enter into a trade trade right after you enter into a trade and< and then go with the you know thinking and then go with the you know thinking that< that oh I'll just wait until it gets that oh I'll just wait until it gets there< there then I'll think about what to do there then I'll think about what to do then< then that's going to be too late right then that's going to be too late right remember< remember this is your real money at remember this is your real money at stake< stake so you want to plan properly stake so you want to plan properly before< before you enter into the trade so before you enter into the trade so planning< planning your exit scenarios mean to be planning your exit scenarios mean to be 100%< 100% fully prepared for wherever the 100% fully prepared for wherever the market< market goes so you know exactly what to market goes so you know exactly what to do< do when it happens especially the worst do when it happens especially the worst case< case scenario now while we cannot case scenario now while we cannot control< control what the market does the market control what the market does the market will< will do whatever it does we actually will do whatever it does we actually kind< kind of already know that the market can kind of already know that the market can go< go only a few places right so imagine go only a few places right so imagine this< this is the market and let's say for this is the market and let's say for example< example you have a bull put spread on example you have a bull put spread on let's< let's just say you have a bull put let's just say you have a bull put spread< spread on now this is time where you spread on now this is time where you already< already need to know exactly what you already need to know exactly what you going< going to do regardless where the market going to do regardless where the market goes< goes because there are only a few places goes because there are only a few places it< it can go it can go all the way up it it can go it can go all the way up it can< can go sideways and it can go all the can go sideways and it can go all the way< way down now given based on this bull way down now given based on this bull put< put spread strategy these two are the put spread strategy these two are the easiest< easiest to manage right because most easiest to manage right because most likely< likely you should be in a profit and likely you should be in a profit and also< also depending right if the market goes also depending right if the market goes sideways< sideways uh how far into the DTE it is sideways uh how far into the DTE it is right< right but it's very simple to manage uh right but it's very simple to manage uh for< for this now the real issue comes when for this now the real issue comes when the< the market really makes a big move and the market really makes a big move and blows< blows through your put credit spread blows through your put credit spread this< this is where a lot of people panic not this is where a lot of people panic not sure< sure what to do you should already have sure what to do you should already have a< a plan for what to do when this happen a plan for what to do when this happen or< or rather if this happens when this or rather if this happens when this happens< happens then once you got a proper plan happens then once you got a proper plan execute< execute it there should be no emotions execute it there should be no emotions involved< involved it should be very objective so involved it should be very objective so when< when you already know the worst case when you already know the worst case scenario< scenario and you accept it then guess scenario and you accept it then guess what< what you're not going to really feel what you're not going to really feel stressful< stressful at night worry at night stressful at night worry at night because< because you already know that that is a because you already know that that is a possible< possible scenario and you already possible scenario and you already accepted< accepted the risk right if you get into accepted the risk right if you get into a< a position right get into a situation a position right get into a situation where< where you can't sleep at night you wake where you can't sleep at night you wake up< up in the middle of the night feeling so up in the middle of the night feeling so stressed< stressed it just means one of two things stressed it just means one of two things number< number one you didn't listen to me you number one you didn't listen to me you didn't< didn't follow this step four you didn't didn't follow this step four you didn't plan< plan your exit scenarios because you plan your exit scenarios because you know< know when the market makes a big move know when the market makes a big move you< you feel so shocked and you didn't you feel so shocked and you didn't expect< expect it to happen right that's number expect it to happen right that's number one< one number two you're trading way too one number two you're trading way too big< big for your comfort right that is why big for your comfort right that is why you< you look at a p&amp;l and by the way staring you look at a p&amp;l and by the way staring at< at it doesn't actually help right A lot at it doesn't actually help right A lot of< of people like to just stay at a p&amp;l I of people like to just stay at a p&amp;l I just< just hope you know please please go back just hope you know please please go back up< up but as the negative goes even deeper up but as the negative goes even deeper in< in the rate it becomes a bigger number in the rate it becomes a bigger number this< this is where people get so affected this is where people get so affected emotionally< emotionally so this is only one of these emotionally so this is only one of these two< two reasons whereby you know you can two reasons whereby you know you can feel< feel so stressed so if you plan your feel so stressed so if you plan your exit< exit scenarios properly you accept the exit scenarios properly you accept the worst< worst case scenario that you have worst case scenario that you have planned< planned out then you shouldn't be planned out then you shouldn't be getting< getting yourself into a situation where getting yourself into a situation where you're< you're surprised or you cannot rest well you're surprised or you cannot rest well at< at night so you have to plan out every at night so you have to plan out every possible< possible scenario that can happen after possible scenario that can happen after you< you end into a trade for example what you end into a trade for example what will< will you do if the market goes up what will you do if the market goes up what will< will you do if the market goes down what will you do if the market goes down what will< will you do if the market goes sideways will you do if the market goes sideways what< what will you do if your strikes get what will you do if your strikes get tested< tested where will you take profit where tested where will you take profit where will< will you cut loss Will you roll if so will you cut loss Will you roll if so how< how will you roll where will you exit so how will you roll where will you exit so all< all these questions you must ask all these questions you must ask yourself< yourself and be really prepared to have yourself and be really prepared to have the< the answer for this before you actually the answer for this before you actually enter< enter into the trade so this is step enter into the trade so this is step four< four now once you've already completed four now once you've already completed this< this You' already planned out your exit this You' already planned out your exit scenario< scenario then this is where you can scenario then this is where you can begin< begin with the demo trading now I know begin with the demo trading now I know that< that with demo trading you know you that with demo trading you know you don't< don't really feel that involved in it don't really feel that involved in it because< because it's not real money and a lot of because it's not real money and a lot of uh< uh people don't really take demo trading uh people don't really take demo trading seriously< seriously but I'll say that if you can seriously but I'll say that if you can get< get into demo trading definitely do it get into demo trading definitely do it first< first right because while demo trading first right because while demo trading may< may not necessarily reflect your actual may not necessarily reflect your actual training< training performance right psychological training performance right psychological wise< wise emotionally wise as well as the wise emotionally wise as well as the fields< fields right the fields of the trades fields right the fields of the trades may< may not be very accurate as well right may not be very accurate as well right but< but what it does is that it gives you but what it does is that it gives you the< the chance to practice putting on the the chance to practice putting on the trade< trade until you're familiar with the trade until you're familiar with the platform< platform and also how you construct the platform and also how you construct the trade< trade because you will be surprised trade because you will be surprised right< right many people start trading live and right many people start trading live and they< they realize after they put on the trade they realize after they put on the trade that< that they constructed it wrongly right that they constructed it wrongly right maybe< maybe they put on the wrong strike or maybe they put on the wrong strike or maybe< maybe they enter into a trade that looks maybe they enter into a trade that looks differently< differently from what they thought it differently from what they thought it should< should be and it makes all these should be and it makes all these mistakes< mistakes so when you do the demo trading mistakes so when you do the demo trading and< and practice it over and over again it and practice it over and over again it at< at least helps reduce the chances of at least helps reduce the chances of making< making mistakes when you start trading making mistakes when you start trading life< life remember the market will be there life remember the market will be there forever< forever right so you have many chances forever right so you have many chances for< for you to keep putting on the trade the for you to keep putting on the trade the most< most important thing is that you do not most important thing is that you do not make< make the mistakes or at least reduce the make the mistakes or at least reduce the chances< chances of making the mistakes when you chances of making the mistakes when you start< start trading life otherwise it will be start trading life otherwise it will be a< a very painful lesson which can be a very painful lesson which can be avoided< avoided if you had already done a proper avoided if you had already done a proper practice< practice or enough practice through demo practice or enough practice through demo trading< trading first so only after you've done trading first so only after you've done enough< enough demo trading doesn't have to be enough demo trading doesn't have to be that< that long right doesn't necessarily have that long right doesn't necessarily have to< to be a year or months it could be after to be a year or months it could be after a< a number of Trades and you feel a number of Trades and you feel confident< confident then you can move on to step confident then you can move on to step six< six which is start trading live and I six which is start trading live and I would< would suggest to trade with the smallest would suggest to trade with the smallest size< size first so once you feel confident size first so once you feel confident enough< enough to place the trades knowing how enough to place the trades knowing how to< to construct them properly and you know to construct them properly and you know how< how to send the order in you can start how to send the order in you can start trading< trading live but start off with this trading live but start off with this smallest< smallest size possible there just one smallest size possible there just one contract< contract first to just get a feel for contract first to just get a feel for the< the strategy and also understand your the strategy and also understand your psychology< psychology and emotions how it's psychology and emotions how it's involved< involved when real money is at stake involved when real money is at stake because< because many time you will see that you because many time you will see that you know< know you have a plan right like I know you have a plan right like I mentioned< mentioned you should plan out your mentioned you should plan out your scenarios< scenarios your exit scenarios but when scenarios your exit scenarios but when it's< it's time for you to actually execute it it's time for you to actually execute it you< you suddenly realize you cannot execute you suddenly realize you cannot execute it< it because of a few things either it because of a few things either because< because of greed or for fear usually because of greed or for fear usually it's< it's one of these two right either greed it's one of these two right either greed you< you want to take a little bit more so you want to take a little bit more so maybe< maybe you don't want to exit and then maybe you don't want to exit and then all< all of a sudden the market turns against all of a sudden the market turns against you< you and for when you're supposed to you and for when you're supposed to actually< actually get that profit all sudden it actually get that profit all sudden it becomes< becomes a loss or fear right fear could becomes a loss or fear right fear could be< be also because you know the market has be also because you know the market has gone< gone down and then maybe it's not time gone down and then maybe it's not time for< for you to cut off the trade yet but for you to cut off the trade yet but your< your fear of losing more you quickly cut your fear of losing more you quickly cut off< off the trade and you end up with you off the trade and you end up with you know< know could have possibly become a winner know could have possibly become a winner so< so it really comes down to your plan if so it really comes down to your plan if you< you have a proper plan just stick to it you have a proper plan just stick to it execute< execute it all right and then put on execute it all right and then put on enough< enough trades until you feel confident enough trades until you feel confident you're< you're ready to size up so as you can you're ready to size up so as you can see< see there's a real proper sequence for see there's a real proper sequence for you< you to do things so that you know slowly you to do things so that you know slowly slowly< slowly you adapt to each stage right you slowly you adapt to each stage right you start< start off with the Demo First you know start off with the Demo First you know put< put on enough trades until you feel put on enough trades until you feel confident< confident then you start trading live confident then you start trading live but< but start off with the smaller size then but start off with the smaller size then you< you start off to put on a number of you start off to put on a number of Trades< Trades until you feel confident enough Trades until you feel confident enough then< then you start to gradually increase then you start to gradually increase your< your size through proper position sizing your size through proper position sizing so< so once you place you enough life trades so once you place you enough life trades with< with the smallest possible size you can with the smallest possible size you can gradually< gradually size up over time with proper gradually size up over time with proper position< position sizing that means proper risk position sizing that means proper risk management< management and money management and also management and money management and also it< it helps to keep a journal and trade it

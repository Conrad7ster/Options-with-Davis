==========================================================================

Language: en all< all right already so today we're going all right already so today we're going to< to be talking about selling in the money to be talking about selling in the money cover< cover cost so there's been some talk cover cost so there's been some talk about< about this I know whether in the money about this I know whether in the money covered< covered course is actually a viable covered course is actually a viable strategy< strategy so is this a good strategy or strategy so is this a good strategy or is< is this simply just a bad mistake so is this simply just a bad mistake so let's< let's find it out together let's find it out together so< so first of all when we sell a cover so first of all when we sell a cover call< call right generally we want to sell one call right generally we want to sell one that< that is above the current price with the that is above the current price with the objective< objective of getting both intrinsic objective of getting both intrinsic value< value and extrinsic value gains so this value and extrinsic value gains so this is< is the cover call position so basically is the cover call position so basically you< you enter one when you enter into a you enter one when you enter into a shares< shares position so you buy 100 shares at shares position so you buy 100 shares at a< a market and then you sell a cover a market and then you sell a cover called< called above the current price called above the current price so< so this way when you sell the cover call so this way when you sell the cover call you'll< you'll be getting premium for this so you'll be getting premium for this so this< this is extrinsic value because you're this is extrinsic value because you're selling< selling out of the money and then the selling out of the money and then the intrinsic< intrinsic value gain will come if the intrinsic value gain will come if the. stock< stock actually goes above the cover call stock actually goes above the cover call strike< strike price at expiration so this way strike price at expiration so this way your< your shares will be caught away and then your shares will be caught away and then you'll< you'll be making the profit from the you'll be making the profit from the point< point of entry to where the cover call point of entry to where the cover call strike< strike price is so in this case you have strike price is so in this case you have the< the double profits in terms of intrinsic the double profits in terms of intrinsic value< value from this point to here and the value from this point to here and the extrinsic< extrinsic value from the cover call now extrinsic value from the cover call now what< what about the in the money cover call what about the in the money cover call so< so the in the money cover call basically so the in the money cover call basically means< means that when you place the 100 shares means that when you place the 100 shares you< you immediately just sell a cover call you immediately just sell a cover call that< that is below the current price of where that is below the current price of where you< you bought the 100 shares now when you you bought the 100 shares now when you take< take a look at this immediately it kind take a look at this immediately it kind of< of don't really make sense right because of don't really make sense right because you< you are selling your cover call below you are selling your cover call below your< your entry price which means that your your entry price which means that your shares< shares will get caught away at a lower shares will get caught away at a lower price< price than where you actually entered so price than where you actually entered so at< at first glance you might think that hey at first glance you might think that hey I'm< I'm buying 88. 69 but then I'm going to I'm buying 88.

69 but then I'm going to sell< sell it away at 85 wouldn't that be a sell it away at 85 wouldn't that be a loss< loss now it does seem like a loss but loss now it does seem like a loss but actually< actually when you're selling this in the actually when you're selling this in the money< money cover call it already has the money cover call it already has the intrinsic< intrinsic value factored for so that intrinsic value factored for so that means< means when you get let's say for example means when you. get let's say for example if< if you do get called away right at this if you do get called away right at this price< price you actually do not make any loss price you actually do not make any loss on< on the intrinsic value because the cover on the intrinsic value because the cover call< call when you sell it it would already call when you sell it it would already have< have this intrinsic value from this have this intrinsic value from this point< point 85 all the way to point 85 all the way to 88. 69< 88.

69 so in this sense you're actually 88. 69 so in this sense you're actually not< not losing anything in terms of not losing anything in terms of intrinsic< intrinsic value so the only thing you're intrinsic value so the only thing you're seeking< seeking to gain is the extrinsic value seeking to gain is the extrinsic value portion< portion of this cover call now depending portion of this cover call now depending on< on where you sell the in the money of on where you sell the in the money of course< course if you sell one that's extremely course if you sell one that's extremely deep< deep in the money let's say somewhere deep in the money let's say somewhere here< here then chances are there's very here then chances are there's very little< little expensive value and kind of make little expensive value and kind of make little< little sense to sell it here right so I little sense to sell it here right so I kind< kind of understand why some people might kind of understand why some people might want< want to sell a cover call that's in the want to sell a cover call that's in the money< money around this price money around this price because< because what they want to do is they are because what they want to do is they are trying< trying to capture the extrinsic value of trying to capture the extrinsic value of this< this cover call only they only. want to this cover call only they only want to make< make money on this extrinsic value in make money on this extrinsic value in case< case right if the market you know just case right if the market you know just goes< goes somewhere anywhere from this point goes somewhere anywhere from this point to< to this point right just anywhere at to this point right just anywhere at this< this point right this point right excuse< excuse my drawings but basically just excuse my drawings but basically just this< this whole Zone anywhere above the cover this whole Zone anywhere above the cover call< call that's what I'm trying to say okay call that's what I'm trying to say okay so< so let's try and uh investigate a little so let's try and uh investigate a little bit< bit into this and see whether it is a bit into this and see whether it is a good< good strategy or not all right so for good strategy or not all right so for this< this let's simulate both the positions this let's simulate both the positions so< so I'm going to simulate both the so I'm going to simulate both the positions positions positions so< so how it's going to work is that we're so how it's going to work is that we're going< going to Long 100 shares at the market going to Long 100 shares at the market so< so it's 88.

69 and then we're going to so it's 88. 69 and then we're going to sell< sell one out of the. money column and sell one out of the money column and 92.

5< 92. 5 for two dollars and 14 cents and 92.

5 for two dollars and 14 cents and then< then we're gonna sell the in the. money then we're gonna sell the in the money call< call at 85 strike price for 6. 18 so call at 85 strike price for 6.

18 so let's< let's see which one is actually better let's see which one is actually better right< right so if you take a look at the calls right so if you take a look at the calls that< that I'm selling this cover call that I'm selling this cover call so< so first of all let's take a look at the so first of all let's take a look at the automatic< automatic call so two dollars and automatic call so two dollars and fourteen< fourteen cents so this is very fourteen cents so this is very straightforward< straightforward I chose this two strikes straightforward I chose this two strikes because< because they are pretty equidistant from because they are pretty equidistant from each< each other from where the current strike each other from where the current strike price< price or rather the current price of the price or rather the current price of the stock< stock is right so we have a kind of a stock is right so we have a kind of a rough< rough gauge or measurement to see which rough gauge or measurement to see which is< is better different depending on the is better different depending on the different<. different scenarios whether the stock different scenarios whether the stock goes< goes up or down so based on this all the goes up or down so based on this all the money< money uh strike price you can see that money uh strike price you can see that we're< we're going to get two dollars fourteen we're going to get two dollars fourteen cents< cents on the mark cents on the mark so< so it's very straightforward this is so it's very straightforward this is just< just all extrinsic value now what about just all extrinsic value now what about the< the in the money call right so this is the in the money call right so this is where< where some people get confused because where some people get confused because if< if you sell in the money cover call if you sell in the money cover call wouldn't< wouldn't that mean that you actually are wouldn't that mean that you actually are a< a loss so I mentioned just now that it's a loss so I mentioned just now that it's actually< actually covered in the intrinsic value actually covered in the intrinsic value so< so if you were to see from 85 to 88. 69 so if you were to see from 85 to 88.

69 there's< there's actually a 3. 69 difference right there's actually a 3.

69 difference right this< this is the intrinsic value difference this is the intrinsic value difference between< between the strike price of the cover between the strike price of the cover call< call and where you lock 100 shares so if call and where. you lock 100 shares so if you< you take a look at the strike price of you take a look at the strike price of the< the 85 call you'll notice that the the 85 call you'll notice that the intrinsic< intrinsic value is 3. 69 right it's just intrinsic value is 3.

#### Topic 1

69 right it's just nice< nice this this is the difference between nice this this is the difference between this< this uh two strike prices so you can see this uh two strike prices so you can see that< that if you were to sell this in the that if you were to sell this. in the money< money call you already take into account money call you already take into account the< the intrinsic value that you would have the intrinsic value that you would have lost< lost if you get caught away here right lost if you get caught away here right so< so you have lost 3. 69 if you get called so you have lost 3.

69 if you get called away< away at this strike price but then by away. at this strike price but then by setting< setting the cover call you get back 3. 69 setting the cover call you get back 3.

69 so< so this is net net zero mean to say so this is net net zero mean to say there< there is no intrinsic value loss as long there is no intrinsic value loss as long as< as you know it's above this cover call as you know it's above this cover call now< now the next thing is the extrinsic now the next thing is the extrinsic value< value so you can see that extrinsic value so you can see that extrinsic value< value is roughly two dollars and fifty value is roughly two dollars. and fifty cents< cents so the goal of the in the money cents so the goal of the in the money covered< covered call uh strategy is to just covered call uh strategy is to just simply< simply get this extrinsic value down simply get this extrinsic value down here< here all right so let's take a look at here all right so let's take a look at the< the different scenarios the different scenarios so< so the very first scenario is that if so the very first scenario is that if Starbucks< Starbucks is above 92. 50 all right so Starbucks is above 92.

50 all right so this< this is the child of Starbucks so if the. this is the child of Starbucks so if the stock< stock goes above 92. 50 what's gonna stock goes above 92.

50 what's gonna happen happen happen well< well first of all for the out of the well first of all for the out of the money< money call the cover call is going to money call the cover call is going to get< get exercise get exercise all< all right an expiration if it's above all right an expiration if it's above the< the strike price you're going to get the strike price you're going to get exercise< exercise so the profit is two false exercise so the profit is two false right< right you have to. profit from your cover right you have to profit from your cover call< call which you sold and you have the call which you sold and you have the profit< profit from your intrinsic value gain profit from your intrinsic value gain from< from where you bought it and where your from where you bought it and where your Shares< Shares are being called away so the Shares are being called away so the profit< profit is so this part is the intrinsic profit is so this part is the intrinsic value< value again so from 92. 50 minus off value again so from 92.

50 minus off 88. 69< 88.

69 plus the extrinsic value of your 88. 69 plus the extrinsic value of your cover< cover call Total you get 5.

95 which is cover call Total you get 5. 95 which is 595< 595 dollars all right so now let's take 595 dollars all right so now let's take a< a look at the in the money call option a look at the in the money call option so< so if you have the in the money cover so if you have the in the money cover call< call same thing as long as above your call same thing as long as above your strike< strike price you're going to get strike price you're going to get exercise< exercise at this point of time right exercise at this point of time right your< your exercise price is actually down your exercise price is actually down here< here you're going to get exercise at 85 here you're going to get exercise at 85 dollars< dollars even though the price goes up dollars even though the price goes up. here here here so< so in this sense you're going to be so in this sense you're going to be taking< taking a loss so to speak on the taking a loss so to speak on the intrinsic< intrinsic value of your shares intrinsic value of your shares difference< difference from where the shares is and difference from where the shares is and the< the strike price of this in the money the strike price of this in the money cover< cover call but then you're going to add cover call but then you're going to add on< on to the value which you have gained on to the value which you have gained from< from selling this uh in the money cover from selling this uh in the money cover call< call which is six dollars and roughly 18 call which is six dollars and roughly 18 6.

18< 6. 18 if you see this but price down here 6.

#### Topic 2

18 if you see this but price down here so< so you notice you actually. make a profit so you notice you actually make a profit of of of 2. 49< 2.

49 so take a look at this 2. 249 2.

49 so take a look at this 2. 249 dollars< dollars and your extrinsic value is 2.

49 dollars and your extrinsic value is 2. 49 so< so it's basically the same right so you so it's basically the same right so you notice< notice all you're doing with an in the notice all you're doing with an in the money< money cover call is that you're just money cover call is that you're just trying< trying to capture the extrinsic value of trying to capture the extrinsic value of this< this option with a a high chance of this option with a a high chance of getting< getting this uh extrinsic value because getting this uh extrinsic value because for< for the shares rather for the stock to for the shares rather for the stock to be< be exercise compared this out of the be exercise compared this out of the money< money and cover call and this in the money and cover call and this in the money< money cover call is easier to get money cover call is easier to get exercise< exercise on this in the money cover call exercise on this in the money cover call than< than it needs to get exercise on this than it needs to get exercise on this out< out of the money cover call so for out of the money cover call so for scenario< scenario one if the stock actually goes scenario one if the stock actually goes up< up all right then it will be better up all right then it will be better that< that you sold the out of the money cover that you sold the out of the money cover call< call because you get the extrinsic value call because you get the extrinsic value gain gain gain that< that is from this point of uh from this that is from this point of uh from this price< price all the way to here for in the price all the way to here for in the money< money cover call you do not get this money cover call you do not get this benefit benefit benefit all< all right now let's take a look at all right now let's take a look at scenario< scenario number two but the way this scenario number two but the way this video< video has been helpful so far I'd video has been helpful so far I'd appreciate< appreciate if you hit the thumbs up appreciate if you hit the thumbs up button< button and also subscribe to my channel button and also subscribe to my channel so< so I can create more videos like this so I can create more videos like this for< for you in the future okay back to the for you in the future okay back to the video< video alright so let's take a look for video alright so let's take a look for the< the out of the money covered call so if the out of the money covered call so if the< the price is somewhere in between this the price is somewhere in between this two< two points is actually below our out of two points is actually below our out of the< the money cover call so this means that the money cover call so this means that our< our cover call our cover call the< the other money cover call expired the other money cover call expired worthless< worthless and the stock is either in a worthless and the stock is either in a profit< profit or drawdown depending on where it profit or drawdown depending on where it is< is right so if it's above our entry is right so if it's above our entry price< price at this point of time it could be price at this point of time it could be quite< quite ideal for those who actually do quite ideal for those who actually do not< not want their stock to be called away not want their stock to be called away because< because your stock will be in a profit because your stock will be in a profit from< from this point to here all right you're from this point to here all right you're seeing< seeing a slight profit at the same time seeing a slight profit at the same time your< your cover call expired worthless so you your cover call expired worthless so you also< also receive the premium from the cover also receive the premium from the cover call< call now if the stock is actually below call now if the stock is actually below your< your entry price so what will happen is your entry price so what will happen is that< that you will actually be in a slight that you will actually be in a slight drawdown drawdown drawdown but< but then you still be able to get the but then you still be able to get the full< full profits of your call so we cannot full profits of your call so we cannot really< really calculate the profit down here really calculate the profit down here because< because you're not out of the position because you're not out of the position right< right you're you still have the 100 right you're you still have the 100 shares< shares so ultimately this whole shares so ultimately this whole positions< positions uh whether you're up or down positions uh whether you're up or down really< really depends on whether the hundred really depends on whether the hundred shares< shares go up in the end or it comes down shares go up in the end or it comes down right< right so for this what we'll do is just right so for this what we'll do is just calculate< calculate the premium which we receive calculate the premium which we receive so< so the premium down here would be just so the premium down here would be just two< two dollars and fourteen cents right now two dollars and fourteen cents right now let's< let's take a look at the in the money let's take a look at the in the money covered< covered call covered call so< so for the in the money cover call so for the in the money cover call your< your cover call will be exercised your cover call will be exercised because< because you are above this uh in the because you are above this uh in the money< money cover call strike Price Right money cover call strike Price Right anywhere< anywhere above 85 dollars anywhere above 85 dollars you're< you're going to get exercise right you're going to get exercise right so< so what's the profit so the same thing so what's the profit so the same thing the< the profit is actually exactly the same the profit is actually exactly the same as< as scenario one there's no difference if as scenario one there's no difference if you< you take a look at a scenario one you take a look at a scenario one because< because you're just being exercised and because you're just being exercised and all< all you're doing is just getting the all you're doing is just getting the extrinsic< extrinsic value gained so in this case extrinsic value gained so in this case if< if the market if the market all< all right if Starbucks actually stays all right if Starbucks actually stays anywhere< anywhere in between here which is and anywhere in between here which is and above< above you're in the money cover call above you're in the money cover call then< then it's actually better if you had then it's actually better if you had sold< sold the in the money cover call right sold the in the money cover call right because< because you you make more and you get because you you make more and you get out< out of the position but then again one out of the position but then again one thing< thing you need to consider is your thing you need to consider is your objective< objective of actually getting into this objective of actually getting into this position< position in the first place do you plan position in the first place do you plan to< to hold this for the long term or you to hold this for the long term or you plan< plan to just capture only the extrinsic plan to just capture only the extrinsic value< value down here right so if you plan to value down here right so if you plan to hold< hold this for a long term this could hold this for a long term this could actually< actually not necessarily be a bad thing actually not necessarily be a bad thing compared< compared to in the money cover call compared to in the money cover call although< although you're making lesser here although you're making lesser here because< because the stock may just be down here because the stock may just be down here at< at expiration but after expiration the at expiration but after expiration the stock< stock could just shoot back up right but stock could just shoot back up right but if< if you have the in the money cover call if you have the in the money cover call you're< you're out of this position so you do you're out of this position so you do not< not get to make money on the intrinsic not get to make money on the intrinsic value< value gain of your 100 shares now but on value gain of your 100 shares now but on the< the other hand the stock could actually the other hand the stock could actually also< also go all the way back down also go all the way back down after< after expiration right so maybe for the after expiration right so maybe for the in< in the money cover call you could have in the money cover call you could have already< already been exercised you're out of the already been exercised you're out of the stock< stock no positions then the stock starts stock no positions then the stock starts to< to tank so if the stock starts to tank to tank so if the stock starts to tank if< if you sold like in the money cover call if you sold like in the money cover call you< you would say wow you're very lucky you would say wow you're very lucky because< because you already got out of the because you already got out of the position< position now as the stock goes down you position now as the stock goes down you do< do not have to sit in for this ride do not have to sit in for this ride because< because you're right out of it but those because you're right out of it but those with< with this 100 shares if you saw the with this 100 shares if you saw the other< other money cover call the stock tanks other money cover call the stock tanks it's< it's going to feel quite sucky right it's going to feel quite sucky right because< because you're going to be seeing a because you're going to be seeing a bigger< bigger drawdown as the stock drops bigger drawdown as the stock drops right< right now let's take a look at scenario right now let's take a look at scenario number< number three the last scenario that is number three the last scenario that is if< if the stock actually goes below the if the stock actually goes below the strike< strike price of the in the money covered strike price of the in the money covered call< call so which is better now the other call so which is better now the other money< money call so the out of the money call money call so the out of the money call your< your cover call will be expired your cover call will be expired worthless< worthless and your stock is in a worthless and your stock is in a drawdown< drawdown so basically what I mentioned drawdown so basically what I mentioned earlier< earlier right so your stock will be in a earlier right so your stock will be in a loss< loss you see in an open loss loss you see in an open loss and< and the only profit which you make or and the only profit which you make or rather< rather the credit which you're going to rather the credit which you're going to receive< receive is rather just the cover call receive is rather just the cover call right< right which you sold two dollars and 14 right which you sold two dollars and 14 cents< cents so basically that's about it what cents so basically that's about it what about< about for the in the money cover call about for the in the money cover call now< now the inner money cover call will also now the inner money cover call will also expire< expire worthless because expire worthless because he< he went below your strike price so in he went below your strike price so in this< this case he went below your strike this case he went below your strike price< price and then you'll still be holding price and then you'll still be holding on< on to the stock as well you still have on to the stock as well you still have 100< 100 shares the difference though is that 100 shares the difference though is that you< you actually collected much more because you actually collected much more because you< you sold your cover call for 618 dollars you sold your cover call for 618 dollars so< so this is almost three times what it is so this is almost three times what it is for< for the out of the money call and in for the out of the money call and in this< this case this case your< your drawdown uh your drawdown uh because< because of your cost basis is going to because of your cost basis is going to be< be lower because you have this 618 your be lower because you have this 618 your overall< overall drawdown your net drawdown is overall drawdown your net drawdown is not< not going to be as big as this out of not going to be as big as this out of the< the money call so in this case if the the money call so. in this case if the market< market actually goes down below the in market actually goes down below the in the< the money you cover call strike price the money you cover call strike price then< then you would actually be better off if then you would actually be better off if you< you had sold the in the money covered you had sold the in the money covered call< call so call so is< is the in the money cover call a viable is the in the money cover call a viable strategy< strategy so I shared with you all the strategy so I shared with you all the three< three scenarios and compare both of them three scenarios and compare both of them side< side by side so is this a viable side by side so is this a viable strategy< strategy is this a good way for you to strategy is this a good way for you to be< be you know making money in the long be you know making money in the long term< term with an in the money cover call term with an in the money cover call so< so here's what I think I think that the so here's what I think I think that the in< in the money cover call can be a viable in the money cover call can be a viable strategy< strategy given the right situation and strategy given the right situation and also< also given the objective you have when also given the objective you have when you< you actually get into this position so you actually get into this position so for< for example for example if< if you plan to buy 100 shares right the if you plan to buy 100 shares right the long< long cartridges and then sell the in the long cartridges and then sell the in the money< money cover call at the same time right money cover call at the same time right it< it will actually be cleaner to just it will actually be cleaner to just selling< selling out the money put option right selling out the money put option right if< if you sell the put option that's out of if you sell the put option that's out of money< money at the same strike price it's money at the same strike price it's actually< actually synthetically the same position actually synthetically the same position right< right if you take a look at this this is right if you take a look at this this is the< the in the money cover call you long the the in the money cover call you long the 100< 100 shares and then you sell the covered 100 shares and then you sell the covered call< call that's in the money and then you call that's in the money and then you sell< sell an out of money put at the same sell an out of money put at the same strike< strike price right so let's go back to strike price right so let's go back to this< this chart again so instead of selling this chart again so instead of selling this< this in the money cover call this in the money cover call right< right all you're doing and you do not right all you're doing and you do not buy< buy this 100 shares all you're doing you buy this 100 shares all you're doing you just< just have to sell this uh put option at just have to sell this uh put option at 85< 85 strike price and if you were to take 85 strike price and if you were to take a< a look at the put option at 85 strike a look at the put option at 85 strike price< price is actually roughly the same price is actually roughly the same premium< premium that you will receive as this premium that you will receive as this extrinsic< extrinsic value down here extrinsic value down here all< all right so that's really not much all right so that's really not much difference< difference so if you take a look at this difference so if you take a look at this risk< risk profile they're pretty much the risk profile they're pretty much the same< same right just only a few dollars same right just only a few dollars difference< difference okay so the reason why you difference okay so the reason why you want< want to do a short put selling it all want to do a short put selling it all the< the money put option rather than go the money put option rather than go through< through the hassle of you know just buy through the hassle of you know just buy 100< 100 shares and then selling in the money 100 shares and then selling in the money cover< cover call at the same time is that cover call at the same time is that there's< there's actually much less buying power there's actually much less buying power needed< needed with the out the money put right needed with the out the money put right you< you don't have to commit the capital to you don't have to commit the capital to buy< buy the 100 shares all right and then buy the 100 shares all right and then you< you just only have one late as opposed you just only have one late as opposed to two< to two with the in the money cover call to two with the in the money cover call position< position you need to buy 100 shares you position you need to buy 100 shares you need< need to sell the cover call so it gets need to sell the cover call so it gets quite< quite clunky compared to if you just to quite clunky compared to if you just to sell< sell one put option and then you manage sell one put option and then you manage it< it so much easier right and for the put it so much easier right and for the put option< option you can just keep rolling the put option you can just keep rolling the put option< option down so if the market goes below option down so if the market goes below your< your strike price you can just keep your strike price you can just keep rolling< rolling again you can roll it out or you rolling again you can roll it out or you can< can roll it down now with the cover call can roll it down now with the cover call it's< it's going to get a little bit messy and it's going to get a little bit messy and you< you don't want to really get through all you don't want to really get through all the< the hassle you know trying to figure out the hassle you know trying to figure out how< how to maintain this position as the how to maintain this position as the stock< stock drops right so if you plan to just stock drops right so if you plan to just sell< sell it in the money cover call sell it in the money cover call immediately< immediately after you have bought the immediately after you have bought the 100< 100 shares then you would I would just 100 shares then you would I would just suggest< suggest that you just sell the out of suggest that you just sell the out of money< money put option because it's pretty money put option because it's pretty much< much the same much the same now< now if you don't mind existing your now if you don't mind existing your stock< stock position then it could be viable stock position then it could be viable right< right it would be a viable strategy to right it would be a viable strategy to sell< sell in the money cover call when the sell in the money cover call when the stock< stock is overbought so if the stock goes stock is overbought so if the stock goes up< up so this is assuming that you actually up so this is assuming that you actually hold< hold on to the stock as the stock goes hold on to the stock as the stock goes up< up first before you sell the in the up first before you sell the in the money< money cover call so that means you money cover call so that means you you< you buy the 100 shares here you buy the 100 shares here all< all right you hold on to it and then all right you hold on to it and then let's< let's say the stock uh the stock comes let's say the stock uh the stock comes down< down here and then you bought the 100 down here and then you bought the 100 shares< shares so you hold on to it you do not shares so you hold on to it you do not sell< sell the in the money cover call First sell the in the money cover call First you< you wait for the stock to go up so this you wait for the stock to go up so this way< way you actually are in profit on your way you actually are in profit on your stock< stock then you sell this in the money stock then you sell this in the money cover< cover call right in this case cover call right in this case you< you will be also making money in terms you will be also making money in terms of< of the intrinsic value game from where of the intrinsic value game from where the< the stock price is to where the in the the stock price is to where the in the money< money cover call is right money cover call is right so< so this would make much more sense to me so this would make much more sense to me to< to sell the in the money cup call so by to sell the in the money cup call so by this< this way you actually secure your exit this way you actually secure your exit price< price at the current price if the stock price at the current price if the stock stays< stays above your in the money cover call stays above your in the money cover call so< so this is where the current stock price so this is where the current stock price is< is if you sell the in the money cover is if you sell the in the money cover call< call at this price remember your cover call at this price remember your cover call< call would have really compensated you call would have really compensated you for< for this intrinsic value loss if you for this intrinsic value loss if you were< were to be called away here so basically were to be called away here so basically you're< you're just securing this exit price you're just securing this exit price already< already right because your cover call already right because your cover call intrinsic< intrinsic value would have really intrinsic value would have really accounted< accounted for this so all you're doing accounted for this so all you're doing is< is that you're gonna get the extrinsic is that you're gonna get the extrinsic value< value on this cover call so that is why value on this cover call so that is why I< I say here you also get the extrinsic I say here you also get the extrinsic value< value portion of the in the money cup value portion of the in the money cup call< call so if the stock drops below the in call so if the stock drops below the in the< the money cover call the money cover call you< you have a huge credit to offset the you have a huge credit to offset the drop< drop in the stock so I actually have a drop in the stock so I actually have a chart< chart down here for you to see what I chart down here for you to see what I mean< mean so for example if you were to buy mean so for example if you were to buy the< the stock down here you hold on to it the stock down here you hold on to it until< until the stock goes up down here and at until the stock goes up down here and at this< this point of time you take a look at this point of time you take a look at your< your stochastics your stochastics and< and then you see that the stochastics is and then you see that the stochastics is overbought< overbought at this point of time so at overbought at this point of time so at this< this point of time when the stock has this point of time when the stock has six< six is overbought it doesn't mean that six is overbought it doesn't mean that the< the market will come down immediately the market will come down immediately there< there is a chance that the stock can there is a chance that the stock can still< still continue going up even though still continue going up even though it< it is overpole right so this is just an it is overpole right so this is just an indication< indication but when there is an indication but when there is an indication< indication of it being overbought it indication of it being overbought it just< just means that there is a higher just means that there is a higher probability< probability that it could come down probability that it could come down compared< compared to it going up so if you're compared to it going up so if you're afraid< afraid that the stock could start to afraid that the stock could start to come< come down and you do not mind getting come down and you do not mind getting out< out of the position and you want to out of the position and you want to secure< secure this current price on top of that secure this current price on top of that you< you also want to get the extrinsic value you also want to get the extrinsic value right< right this extrinsic value of 2.

50 down right this extrinsic value of 2. 50 down here< here that comes together with this in here that comes together with this in the< the money cover call then you can sell the money cover call then you can sell the< the in the money cover call right so the in the money cover call right so this< this way what you're actually hoping is this way what you're actually hoping is let< let me just remove the drawing so what let me just remove the drawing so what you're< you're actually hoping when you're you're actually hoping when you're selling< selling the in the money cover call is selling the in the money cover call is that< that the stock price would. ideally that the stock price would ideally stay< stay above this cover call right so this stay above this cover call right so this way< way that you would be called away on way that you would be called away on your< your shares your shares and< and then you'll still be able to get and then you'll still be able to get this< this nice premium at the same time when this nice premium at the same time when you< you sell the in money cover call again you sell the in money cover call again you< you will still be essentially getting you will still be essentially getting out< out at this current price of 88.

69 out at this current price of 88. 69 because< because of the intrinsic value gain and because of the intrinsic value gain and if< if the stock was to drop below your if the stock was to drop below your cover< cover call that means you do not get cover call that means you do not get exercise< exercise and you still hold on to the exercise and you still hold on to the shares< shares at least you still have a big shares at least you still have a big compensation< compensation in this case right because compensation in this case right because you're< you're receiving quite a bit of Premium you're receiving quite a bit of Premium compared< compared to if you were to sell the out compared to if you were to sell the out of< of the money uh cover call where you of the money uh cover call where you only< only receive you know two dollars and 14 only receive you know two dollars and 14 cents< cents right so if the market drops below cents right so if the market drops below your< your in the money cup call we have your in the money cup call we. have already< already seen that it's actually better already seen that it's actually better for< for you to have you know the the huge for you to have you know the the huge premium< premium you get from in the money cover premium you get from in the money cover call< call rather than selling the out of the call rather than selling the out of the money< money cover call money cover call now< now if you're worried in the first place now if you're worried in the first place that< that it will continue to drop even more that it will continue to drop even more and< and you don't want to wait all the way and you don't want to wait all the way to< to expiration to see whether you know it to expiration to see whether you know it will< will expire above your cover call what will expire above your cover call what you< you should do is that you can just sell you should do is that you can just sell away< away the stock outright right you can away the stock outright right you can just< just sell at 88.

69 without even selling just sell at 88. 69 without even selling any< any covered calls so this way if the any covered calls so this way if the stock< stock actually goes down after that you stock actually goes down after that you don't< don't have to worry you know you should don't have to worry you know you should have< have sold it earlier on or what so this have sold it earlier on or what so this is< is my take on the in the money cover is my take on the in the money cover call< call so it can be viable given the right call so it can be viable given the right situation< situation but again if you are selling situation but again if you are selling the< the in the money cover call strategy at the in the money cover call strategy at the< the point on time when you're actually the point on. time when you're actually buying< buying 100 shares then I would suggest buying 100 shares then I would suggest that< that you just sell the out of the money that you just sell the out of the money put< put option because it's exactly pretty put option because it's exactly pretty much< much the same alright guys so I hope much the same alright guys so I hope this< this video has been helpful to you and this video has been helpful to you and if< if it has I would appreciate it if you if it has I would appreciate it if you give< give me a thumbs up and also subscribe give me a thumbs up and also subscribe to< to my channel and as always thank you to my channel and as always thank you for< for watching I appreciate your time and for watching I appreciate your time and may<

Language: en all< all right alrighty so I have finally all right alrighty so I have finally been< been bitten by the bug right I have been bitten by the bug right I have decided< decided to finally trade zero DTE decided to finally trade zero DTE options< options right right now zero DT options options right right now zero DT options are< are the craze everybody's talking about are the craze everybody's talking about it< it a lot of people on YouTube are it a lot of people on YouTube are trading< trading it so you know I decided to take trading it so you know I decided to take the< the plunge and just find out what all the plunge and just find out what all this< this craze about and I just decided to this craze about and I just decided to trade< trade zero DT options to see for myself trade zero DT options to see for myself is< is there really you know if there really is there really you know if there really was< was something there right so for the was something there right so for the most< most part I was very hesitant to trade most part I was very hesitant to trade zero< zero DT options I was hesitant I was zero DT options I was hesitant I was reluctant< reluctant I was very resistant and the reluctant I was very resistant and the main< main reason why I was very reluctant to main reason why I was very reluctant to trade< trade zero DT options is because of the trade zero DT options is because of the edge< edge right so edge right so let< let me explain a little bit more so when let me explain a little bit more so when we< we trade options we need to First we trade options we need to First understand< understand where is our Edge right if understand where is our Edge right if there's< there's no Edge there's no reason why we there's no Edge there's no reason why we should< should actually be trading the vehicle should actually be trading the vehicle so< so when you are selling options this is so when you are selling options this is where< where our Edge comes and the edge comes where our Edge comes and the edge comes basically< basically from the fact that the implied basically from the fact that the implied volatility< volatility is greater than the realized volatility is greater than the realized volatility< volatility right it overstates you volatility right it overstates you realize< realize volatility a lot of the time so realize volatility a lot of the time so what< what this means is that the expected what this means is that the expected move< move is greater than the actual realized move is greater than the actual realized move< move so this table down here is a study move so this table down here is a study done< done by the folks at tastytrade so what done by the folks at tastytrade so what they< they have done on this studies is to see they have done on this studies is to see whether< whether the expected move right the whether the expected move right the theoretical< theoretical uh probability of win theoretical uh probability of win matches< matches the actual win results right matches the actual win results right when< when it's actually brought to live when it's actually brought to live trading< trading so you can see down here the trading so you can see down here the theoretical< theoretical win when you trade the theoretical win when you trade the expected< expected move right roughly it's either expected move right roughly it's either using< using you know the expected move formula using you know the expected move formula or< or the 16 Delta options basically the or the 16 Delta options basically the theoretical< theoretical is 68 right but as you can theoretical is 68 right but as you can see< see the actual occurrences which is see the actual occurrences which is basically< basically the actual results it's basically the actual results it's actually< actually much higher than 68 right it's actually much higher than 68 right it's somewhere< somewhere from 71 all the way to 85 somewhere from 71 all the way to 85 which< which means to say whatever you're which means to say whatever you're seeing< seeing on the risk profile right the seeing on the risk profile right the theoretical< theoretical win which you see is usually theoretical win which you see is usually understated< understated right that means your actual understated right that means your actual win< win is going to be much higher which win is going to be much higher which gives< gives you the edge that's why you're gives you the edge that's why you're going< going to be profitable over the long run going to be profitable over the long run so< so here is another study done by the so here is another study done by the team team team the< the tasty trade folks you can see down the tasty trade folks you can see down here< here this is on spy the index ETF you here this is on spy the index ETF you can< can see that regardless of the can see that regardless of the volatility< volatility right the expected move is volatility right the expected move is always< always greater than the average realized always greater than the average realized move< move right so you can see it doesn't move right so you can see it doesn't matter< matter what the volatility is the matter what the volatility is the volatility< volatility could be low the volatility volatility could be low the volatility right< right also could be high right in all right also could be high right in all cases< cases you can see that the expected move cases you can see that the expected move is< is much greater than the realized move is much greater than the realized move and< and that is why we have an edge as an and that is why we have an edge as an option< option seller right when we sell options option seller right when we sell options so< so what it means on the chart is this so what it means on the chart is this right< right so for example if you were to take right so for example if you were to take a< a look at the 16 Delta options or the a look at the 16 Delta options or the expected< expected move range which you can see on expected move range which you can see on your< your option chain what it will show that your option chain what it will show that you< you know let's say for example this you know let's say for example this stock< stock down here you'll see that the stock down here you'll see that the expected< expected move is like this so based on expected move is like this so based on the< the time frame let's say for example in the time frame let's say for example in the< the next 50 days right let's say this is the next 50 days right let's say this is the< the 50 days to expiration left for the the 50 days to expiration left for the options< options it says that the expected range options it says that the expected range will< will be somewhere down here but in will be somewhere down here but in actual< actual fact right after the move has actual fact right after the move has already< already happened the realized move this already happened the realized move this is< is actually the actual move right so is actually the actual move right so this< this is based on a 68 probability of this is based on a 68 probability of profit< profit right so that means it's trying profit right so that means it's trying to< to say 68 of time it will actually be in to say 68 of time it will actually be in this< this range but in actual fact the 68 this range but in actual fact the 68 range< range is down here so what about the range is down here so what about the range< range all the way to the actual supposed range all the way to the actual supposed expected< expected range which means to say this expected range which means to say this number< number is much higher and that is how number is much higher and that is how you< you get the 71 to 85 percent right so you get the 71 to 85 percent right so this< this is our Edge now this is all Theory this is our Edge now this is all Theory right< right it's very nice right I mean it's right it's very nice right I mean it's saying< saying that you know this is the theory saying that you know this is the theory based< based on this Statistics which they say based on this Statistics which they say that< that it's going to be much higher but that it's going to be much higher but what< what about in terms of practical terms what about in terms of practical terms right< right so what I did is that I put out right so what I did is that I put out the< the last 100 trades which I had for this the last 100 trades which I had for this triangle< triangle so what other better way you triangle so what other better way you can< can actually trade the expected move can actually trade the expected move than< than the vanilla strangle right so the than the vanilla strangle right so the strangle< strangle is the cleanest way the purest strangle is the cleanest way the purest way< way for you to trade the expected move way for you to trade the expected move right< right so roughly 16 Deltas on both sides right so roughly 16 Deltas on both sides right< right you have a shot put and you have a right you have a shot put and you have a short< short call so I took the last 100 trades short call so I took the last 100 trades and< and the theoretical win rate as you can and the theoretical win rate as you can see< see is supposed to be 68 right so if you see is supposed to be 68 right so if you were< were to take 16 Deltas on both sides were to take 16 Deltas on both sides it's< it's supposed to be 68 probability of it's supposed to be 68 probability of wind< wind but as you can see the actual win wind but as you can see the actual win rate< rate which I've gotten is 77 right so rate which I've gotten is 77 right so this< this is based on actual trades rather this is based on actual trades rather than< than Theory right so you can see this is than Theory right so you can see this is how< how it panned out in actual trades so how it panned out in actual trades so the< the actual win rate is 77 loss rate is the actual win rate is 77 loss rate is 23< 23 and it all pans out to a profit at 23 and it all pans out to a profit at the< the end so that is why when we are the end so that is why when we are trading< trading options when we are selling trading options when we are selling options< options we have an edge here right the options we have an edge here right the strangle< strangle for me is a bread and butter strangle for me is a bread. and butter strategy< strategy right so that is why I lean on strategy right so that is why I lean on it< it a lot when I want to trade the it a lot when I want to trade the expected< expected move so you might be wondering expected move so you might be wondering right< right now so it seems that there's the right now so it seems that there's the edge< edge down here right so that means when edge down here right so that means when you< you trade zero DTE options that's going you trade zero DTE options that's going to< to be this Edge as well right that means to be this Edge as well right that means the< the actual win rate is going to be much the actual win rate is going to be much higher< higher than the theoretical win rate higher than the theoretical win rate which< which means say if you trade zero DTE which means say if you trade zero DTE you're< you're going to realize your profits you're going to realize your profits much< much quicker you know every single day much quicker you know every single day you< you put on the trade you're gonna have a you put on the trade you're gonna have a a< a result at the end of the day and you a result at the end of the day and you know< know that over the long run you're gonna know that over the long run you're gonna be< be profitable so is that actually true be profitable so is that actually true I'm< I'm not too sure right and the reason is I'm not too sure right and the reason is because< because of this right so the problem because of this right so the problem with< with 0 DTE comes down to whether the with 0 DTE comes down to whether the expected< expected move is actually greater than expected move is actually greater than the< the realized move so you can see again the realized move so you can see again this< this is a study done by the tasty trade this is a study done by the tasty trade team< team you can see the study has gone all team you can see the study has gone all the< the way back since 1993 so there is a the way back since 1993 so there is a lot< lot of data down here right so this is a lot of data down here right so this is a very< very significant data set which we are very significant data set which we are looking< looking at down here so this is on the looking at down here so this is on the spiders< spiders you can see that if you were to spiders you can see that if you were to use< use the 45 days all the way to 90 days use the 45 days all the way to 90 days you< you can see that you know in this time you can see that you know in this time frame< frame right pretty much it means that if frame right pretty much it means that if you< you use the 45 DTE all the way to 90 DTE you use the 45 DTE all the way to 90 DTE you< you can see that this expected move is you can see that this expected move is greater< greater than the actual realized move so greater than the actual realized move so in< in this time frame you're going to see in this time frame you're going to see that< that you're going to win more than the that you're going to win more than the theoretical< theoretical win rate theoretical win rate right< right so you can see 45 to 90 days and right so you can see 45 to 90 days and that< that is generally why I want to stick to that is generally why I want to stick to 40< 40 to 60 days whenever I'm trading you 40 to 60 days whenever I'm trading you know< know the the options this is the time know the the options this is the time where< where the Theta is good if you go a where the Theta is good if you go a little< little bit more to 90 days although the little bit more to 90 days although the edge< edge or rather the expected move is much edge or rather the expected move is much greater< greater than the average realized move greater than the average realized move you< you can see down here is a two percent you can see down here is a two percent difference< difference whereas for 45 days you know difference whereas for 45 days you know it's< it's only only a point five percent it's only only a point five percent right< right so it's much more pronounced the right so it's much more pronounced the edge< edge as more days goes out right but the edge as more days goes out right but the thing< thing is that you know when you're thing is that you know when you're trading< trading the options the Theta Decay is trading the options the Theta Decay is most< most Optimum roughly around this time most Optimum roughly around this time frame< frame so generally I go for around 40 to frame so generally I go for around 40 to 60< 60 days now what about 0 DTE right so 60 days now what about 0 DTE right so again< again the tasty trade team they have again the tasty trade team they have done< done the research and you can see that done the research and you can see that anywhere< anywhere from 30 days all the way to anywhere from 30 days all the way to seven< seven days and Below basically under 30 seven days and Below basically under 30 days< days your expected move is actually days your expected move is actually lesser< lesser than your realized move which lesser than your realized move which means< means to say if you were to go back to means to say if you were to go back to the< the Chart down here all right let me the Chart down here all right let me just< just remove all these drawings the just remove all these drawings the expected< expected theoretical moves is this but expected theoretical moves is this but the< the actual move could actually be the actual move could actually be greater< greater right so it's actually much greater right so it's actually much bigger< bigger so that means you're looking at a bigger so that means you're looking at a range< range of somewhere from here to here range of somewhere from here to here which< which means to say if the theoretical which means to say if the theoretical move< move says you're going to win 68 percent move says you're going to win 68 percent of< of time but if it's going to make a of time but if it's going to make a bigger< bigger move than expected move it means bigger move than expected move it means you're< you're going to actually lose more than you're going to actually lose more than what< what it says down here that means you what it says down here that means you win< win 68 of the time the chances are that win 68 of the time the chances are that you're< you're going to win lesser than 68 of you're going to win lesser than 68 of the< the time so suddenly now you have a the time so suddenly now you have a Negative< Negative Edge right you can see down Negative Edge right you can see down here< here the a realized move is more than here the a realized move is more than the< the expected move so when I saw this the expected move so when I saw this data< data set quite some time ago that is why data set quite some time ago that is why I< I was very hesitant to trade you know I was very hesitant to trade you know the< the weekly options or anything that's the weekly options or anything that's under< under 30 days right people have asked under 30 days right people have asked can< can you trade this on the weekly options can you trade this on the weekly options can< can you trade some of the strategies can you trade some of the strategies which< which are shared on the weekly options which are shared on the weekly options the< the answer is yes you can trade them but the answer is yes you can trade them but when< when you have an edge it's uncertain when you have an edge it's uncertain right< right it's not very clear down there right it's not very clear down there unless< unless you have some sort of a very unless you have some sort of a very strong< strong long directional bias you are strong long directional bias you are good< good at picking directions then yes you good at picking directions then yes you can< can overcome this Negative Edge and can overcome this Negative Edge and you'll< you'll be profitable in the long run but you'll be profitable in the long run but if< if you want to trade something like the if you want to trade something like the the< the iron Condor the strangle where it the iron Condor the strangle where it pretty< pretty much pretty much you< you know you only profit if it stays you know you only profit if it stays within< within expect a move then it's going to within expect a move then it's going to be< be a question mark right whether zero be a question mark right whether zero DTE< DTE is going to be profitable but with DTE is going to be profitable but with that< that said you know recently the tasty that said you know recently the tasty trade< trade team they have come up a lot of trade team they have come up a lot of research< research with zero DT as well to see you research with zero DT as well to see you know< know how you can profit from there I know how you can profit from there I decided< decided to take the plunge try it out decided to take the plunge try it out for< for myself to see whether it's really for myself to see whether it's really profitable< profitable and the results were actually profitable and the results were actually um um um not< not something that I actually expected not something that I actually expected right< right so the first thing that I was right so the first thing that I was faced< faced with is choosing a zero DTE faced with is choosing a zero DTE training<

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video now there are many back to the video now there are many different< different ways that people are trading different ways that people are trading zero< zero DT options right the many different zero DT options right the many different ways< ways so first of all this is not the one ways so first of all this is not the one you< you know the the end-all and BR of the you know the the end-all and BR of the the< the strategy that I'm going to be the strategy that I'm going to be trading< trading in a sense whereby don't use my trading in a sense whereby don't use my results< results to say that all right ZD 0dt results to say that all right ZD 0dt options< options work or don't work right there options work or don't work right there are< are many different strategies So based are many different strategies So based on< on the many different strategies you can on the many different strategies you can see< see that they they have the long call see that they they have the long call the< the long put right they're just buying the long put right they're just buying an< an option outright just a very an option outright just a very directional< directional basis and then you have directional basis and then you have selling< selling naked calls naked puts as well selling naked calls naked puts as well just< just to collect extrinsic value because just to collect extrinsic value because the< the idea here is that you know the last the idea here is that you know the last day< day the Theta is going to be the highest day the Theta is going to be the highest you're< you're going to really Decay a lot of you're going to really Decay a lot of the< the value so the thought of selling the value so the thought of selling naked< naked calls and puts the other way is by naked calls and puts the other way is by trading< trading butterflies iron flies trading butterflies iron flies butterflies< butterflies is more of directional where butterflies is more of directional where you< you choose either you know the market is you choose either you know the market is going< going to go up or go down iron fly is going to go up or go down iron fly is more< more neutral right just at this right more neutral right just at this right smack< smack at the money uh options right and smack at the money uh options right and then< then you have the credit spreads this is then you have the credit spreads this is probably< probably I think the most popular one probably I think the most popular one which< which I see a lot of people on YouTube which I see a lot of people on YouTube are< are actually talking about it right are actually talking about it right credit< credit spreads you pick the direction credit spreads you pick the direction and< and then they manage it somewhere you and then they manage it somewhere you know< know intraday and they take many trades know intraday and they take many trades throughout< throughout the day and the final one is throughout the day and the final one is the< the iron Condor right the iron Condor the iron Condor right the iron Condor basically< basically just manages or brother is basically just manages or brother is trading< trading the expected move so when I trading the expected move so when I choose< choose this strategy I have a few choose this strategy I have a few criteria< criteria so the first criteria is that I criteria so the first criteria is that I want< want to avoid selling naked options want to avoid selling naked options because< because the gamma is at its highest at because the gamma is at its highest at zero< zero DTE right gamma is a very uh it's zero DTE right gamma is a very uh it's detriment< detriment to you if you are selling detriment to you if you are selling options< options with an option seller because a options with an option seller because a big< big move right any move is going to big move right any move is going to negate< negate a lot of the Theta that you're negate a lot of the Theta that you're gonna< gonna gain right so it's very dangerous gonna gain right so it's very dangerous to< to sell Naked options because you could to sell Naked options because you could lose< lose a lot of money so that means the lose a lot of money so that means the strangle< strangle is out of the question and any strangle is out of the question and any naked< naked calls or puts will be out of the naked calls or puts will be out of the question< question as well next I want a strategy question as well next I want a strategy that< that was simple to execute with zero that was simple to execute with zero management< management right I just want to put the management right I just want to put the trade< trade once leave it to expiration and trade once leave it to expiration and it's< it's pretty much like a set and forget it's pretty much like a set and forget strategy< strategy right mainly because I do not strategy right mainly because I do not trade< trade throughout the whole day right I trade throughout the whole day right I want< want a strategy where I can just put out want a strategy where I can just put out once< once you know I just go and do my all once you know I just go and do my all other< other stuff right I don't have to. other stuff right I don't have to monitor< monitor the the market all the way until monitor the the market all the way until the< the market closes right and if you have the market closes right and if you have a< a full-time job right this will be the a full-time job right this will be the kind< kind of strategy you would want as well kind of strategy you would want as well right< right just put it on and then you go right just put it on and then you go ahead< ahead with your day at the end of the ahead with your day at the end of the day< day when you come back from work you can day when you come back from work you can see< see whether it's a profit or loss and I see whether it's a profit or loss and I want< want one which is relatively high want one which is relatively high probability< probability of profit without being probability of profit without being directional< directional and a lot of people lose directional and a lot of people lose money< money trading you know in general right money trading you know in general right bid< bid options or outright trading is by bid options or outright trading is by being< being directional I've been in the being directional I've been in the proprietary< proprietary training firm and the way proprietary training firm and the way the< the firms really trade isn't really the firms really trade isn't really directional< directional right they trade a very directional right they trade a very neutral< neutral style of trading like spreading neutral style of trading like spreading or< or Market making where there's not much or Market making where there's not much in< in terms of direction right so if you in terms of direction right so if you want< want to be directional you can but it's want to be directional you can but it's going< going to be a very difficult Journey for going to be a very difficult Journey for you< you to be profitable unless you're very you to be profitable unless you're very good< good at technical reading charts and all good at technical reading charts and all that< that so the strategy that I've chosen is that so the strategy that I've chosen is to< to truly expect the move using the I to truly expect the move using the I iron< iron Condor right the iron Contour iron Condor right the iron Contour strategy< strategy and I want it to be on the SPX strategy and I want it to be on the SPX right< right SPX because it is a European style right SPX because it is a European style options< options that is Cash settle that means options that is Cash settle that means there< there is no early assignment risk with there is no early assignment risk with that< that said here are the trade mechanics that said here are the trade mechanics right< right of this strategy which I put on so right of this strategy which I put on so I< I put on the iron Condor they will be in I put on the iron Condor they will be in the< the first few hours of the market open I the first few hours of the market open I won't< won't be there to watch it until the won't be there to watch it until the market< market close so uh the Deltas we are market close so uh the Deltas we are chosen< chosen is somewhere from 15 to 25 Deltas chosen is somewhere from 15 to 25 Deltas for< for the short strike so the win rate is for the short strike so the win rate is approximately< approximately 60 to 65 percent that's approximately 60 to 65 percent that's the< the theoretical win rate and then the the theoretical win rate and then the five< five dollar width of the wings so the five dollar width of the wings so the maximum< maximum loss is pretty much 500 minus maximum loss is pretty much 500 minus the< the credit received right so this way I the credit received right so this way I really< really you know just trade a small really you know just trade a small amount< amount it's a very small size I won't amount it's a very small size I won't get< get hurt that badly if it goes wrong and get hurt that badly if it goes wrong and I'm< I'm just going to hold it all the way to I'm just going to hold it all the way to expiration< expiration so this is the strategy I expiration so this is the strategy I went< went forward in terms of 0 DTE so here went forward in terms of 0 DTE so here are< are the results so the results I must are the results so the results I must say< say are actually pretty surprising right say are actually pretty surprising right at< at least mildly surprising uh in in the at least mildly surprising uh in in the sense< sense right so I don't know they it's sense right so I don't know they it's actually< actually in a profit I wasn't actually actually in a profit I wasn't actually expecting< expecting a profit I was expecting maybe expecting a profit I was expecting maybe kind< kind of a loss but in the end it turned kind of a loss but in the end it turned out to< out to be a slight profit although it's out to be a slight profit although it's not< not going to be something big right so not going to be something big right so here< here are the statistics right the here are the statistics right the statistics< statistics is that the win rate is same statistics is that the win rate is same 3.

33< 3. 33 and that is why I say it's 3.

33 and that is why I say it's surprising< surprising right mildly surprising surprising right mildly surprising because< because uh theoretical win rate is 60 to because uh theoretical win rate is 60 to 65< 65 so this is much higher than 60 to 65 65 so this is much higher than 60 to 65 percent< percent and remember previously when I percent and remember previously when I showed< showed you this table you know I didn't showed you this table you know I didn't expect< expect that the win rate gonna be that expect that the win rate gonna be that high< high right I expected that the win rate high right I expected that the win rate is< is going to match whatever the is going to match whatever the theoretical< theoretical win rate is but in the end theoretical win rate is but in the end it< it turned out to be a little bit higher it turned out to be a little bit higher at< at the end of the day right yeah the at the end of the day right yeah the average< average win average loss and the average win average loss and the expectancy< expectancy is a positive one so does expectancy is a positive one so does this< this mean that the zero DTE options or this mean that the zero DTE options or at< at least this strategy is going to be at least this strategy is going to be profitable< profitable in the long run profitable in the long run well< well the answer right now I have for you well the answer right now I have for you is< is still a question mark right so the is still a question mark right so the reason< reason is because you see one loss is reason is because you see one loss is going< going to be pretty big all right one going to be pretty big all right one loss< loss is going to wipe up any profits loss is going to wipe up any profits which< which I have already gained so at this which I have already gained so at this point< point of time it's still a little bit point of time it's still a little bit uncertain< uncertain although it is quite promising uncertain although it is quite promising at< at this stage in time right and the at this stage in time right and the reason< reason why it's still a question mark is reason why it's still a question mark is because< because you need to understand how we because you need to understand how we can< can achieve the true probability of any can achieve the true probability of any trading< trading strategy that we put on so let's trading strategy that we put on so let's say< say for example say for example if< if you were to flip an unbiased coin 10 if you were to flip an unbiased coin 10 times< times right a coin we know is 50 hits 50 times right a coin we know is 50 hits 50 Tails< Tails so if you were to just flip it 10 Tails so if you were to just flip it 10 times< times is it possible to get 7 hits and times is it possible to get 7 hits and three< three Tails well the answer is yes well three Tails well the answer is yes well it's< it's definitely possible you could have it's definitely possible you could have seven< seven hit three tails even eight hits or seven hit three tails even eight hits or even< even dying hits right maybe you know even dying hits right maybe you know somehow< somehow you're very lucky but what if somehow you're very lucky but what if you< you flip the unbiased coins a thousand you flip the unbiased coins a thousand times< times is it possible for you to get 700 times is it possible for you to get 700 hits< hits sorry 700 hits and 300 Tails well hits sorry 700 hits and 300 Tails well the< the chances are very very unlikely the chances are very very unlikely unless< unless it is a biased coin so you can unless it is a biased coin so you can see< see down here this is the graph of how see down here this is the graph of how it< it looks like when it when it comes to it looks like when it when it comes to probability< probability right you can see that when probability right you can see that when your< your sample size is very small let's say your sample size is very small let's say for< for example even if you were to for example even if you were to somewhere< somewhere around 15 trades right you can somewhere around 15 trades right you can see< see I have 15 trades So based on 15 see I have 15 trades So based on 15 trades< trades is somewhere down here if you trades is somewhere down here if you were< were to just you know flip the coin 15 were to just you know flip the coin 15 times< times you might be led to believe that times you might be led to believe that this< this coin is biased that this coin have this coin is biased that this coin have you< you know seven times you can be on the you know seven times you can be on the hits< hits side three times on the tail side hits side three times on the tail side right< right but if you start to get more right but if you start to get more sample< sample size you start to flip the coin sample size. you start to flip the coin more< more and more you notice that it will more and more you notice that it will eventually< eventually go to the mean eventually go to the mean and< and it will hover around the 50 which is and it will hover around the 50 which is where< where the true probability is and this where the true probability is and this is< is very true and the same for your is very true and the same for your trading< trading strategies when it comes to trading strategies when it comes to training< training options as well so this is the training options as well so this is the study< study done by TC trade again so what study done by TC trade again so what they< they did is they went to take a look at they did is they went to take a look at an< an 80 win rate strategy so they want to an 80 win rate strategy so they want to see< see how many sample sizes how many see how many sample sizes how many occurrences< occurrences you need to have in order occurrences you need to have in order for< for you to reach the true probability so for you to reach the true probability so in< in a sense you can see that you know you in a sense you can see that you know you need< need to really have many sample size need to really have many sample size right< right if you have a small sample size right if you have a small sample size let's< let's say for example around 15 right let's say for example around 15 right somewhere< somewhere down here you can see you somewhere down here you can see you later< later to believe that you know you have later to believe that you know you have a< a 90 win rate or on the other side you a 90 win rate or on the other side you might< might think that there's only a 60 win might think that there's only a 60 win rate< rate and you discard the strategy rate and you discard the strategy altogether< altogether right but in order for you to altogether right but in order for you to understand< understand whether this the strategy is understand whether this the strategy is going< going to be profitable or not in the going to be profitable or not in the long< long term whether you know the win rate long term whether you know the win rate what< what is the true win rate you need to be what is the true win rate you need to be able< able to have a huge sample size so at able to have a huge sample size so at the< the moment right now the sample size the moment right now the sample size which< which I have is still very small there's which I have is still very small there's only< only 15 trades that I put on and this is only 15 trades that I put on and this is across< across you know the past three weeks or across you know the past three weeks or so so so so< so uh it's still a question mark but I so uh it's still a question mark but I do< do think there is some promise down here do think there is some promise down here right< right it's a little bit promising and right it's a little bit promising and I'll< I'll still continue to prone the streets I'll still continue to prone the streets and< and see whether there is something uh to and see whether there is something uh to really< really trade on for the zero DT whether really trade on for the zero DT whether we< we do have an edge to use this strategy we do have an edge to use this strategy so< so whatever option strategies you want so whatever option strategies you want to< to put on it's important for you to have to put on it's important for you to have a< a pretty large sample size for you to a pretty large sample size for you to really< really know whether it's going to be really know whether it's going to be profitable< profitable in the long term all right profitable in the long term all right guys< guys so this is the zero DT iron Condor guys so this is the zero DT iron Condor on< on SPX strategy so the question is are on SPX strategy so the question is are you< you going to trade the zero DTE options you going to trade the zero DTE options let< let me know in the comments below by the let me know in the comments below by the way< way if you like this video then you're way if you like this video then you're absolutely< absolutely going to love this next video absolutely going to love this next video which< which I have

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you five I'm going to be sharing with you five option< option strategies that are profitable option strategies that are profitable over< over the longterm so guys the keyw here over the longterm so guys the keyw here is< is the longterm now for this to have a is the longterm now for this to have a long-term< long-term profitability two things need long-term profitability two things need to< to be aligned with each other so the to be aligned with each other so the first< first one is your option strategies okay first one is your option strategies okay so< so let me just write it here now the so let me just write it here now the second< second one is the underlying right second one is the underlying right underlying< underlying is basically what what it is underlying is basically what what it is right< right what is underlying you're going to right what is underlying you're going to trade< trade that basically aligns that trade that basically aligns that cohesive< cohesive with this option strategy that cohesive with this option strategy that you're< you're going to use so these two need to you're going to use so these two need to actually< actually align with each other right actually align with each other right they< they are almost like a a couple right they are almost like a a couple right imagine< imagine you know this is the husband imagine you know this is the husband this< this is their wife right they both need this is their wife right they both need to< to get along well for the relationship to get along well for the relationship to< to work but if they start to quarrel to work but if they start to quarrel then< then guess what there going to be a then guess what there going to be a breakup< breakup it's going to be a divorce well breakup it's going to be a divorce well some< some of you maybe it's just boyfriend some of you maybe it's just boyfriend and< and girlfriend right things are not to and girlfriend right things are not to go< go well right then things are not going go well right then things are not going to< to go well then in terms of option to go well then in terms of option strategy< strategy that's where you're going to strategy that's where you're going to you< you know lose money so it's very you know lose money so it's very important< important that when we are choosing this important that when we are choosing this option< option strategy it has to align with the option strategy it has to align with the underlying< underlying that we're going to choose underlying that we're going to choose the< the characteristics of the underly has the characteristics of the underly has to< to suit this option strategy so for the to suit this option strategy so for the most< most part these strategies that I'm most part these strategies that I'm going< going to share with you we're going to going to share with you we're going to trade< trade a very very specific type of trade a very very specific type of underlying< underlying and this specific type of underlying and this specific type of underlying< underlying if you guys have been underlying if you guys have been following< following my channel for quite some time following my channel for quite some time now< now you guys probably already know and now you guys probably already know and that< that is to trade the index ETFs right so that is to trade the index ETFs right so the< the index ETFs not any index ETFs we the index ETFs not any index ETFs we want< want the US broad-based ones the very want the US broad-based ones the very very< very popular ones like for example iwm very popular ones like for example iwm spy< spy QQQ so on and so forth now one thing spy QQQ so on and so forth now one thing to< to understand is What is the to understand is What is the characteristic< characteristic of these underlying that characteristic of these underlying that we're< we're choosing right this characteristic we're choosing right this characteristic of< of the underlying one thing you need to of the underlying one thing you need to understand< understand that it is called understand that it is called positive< positive drift right positive drift positive drift right positive drift positive< positive drift just means that over time positive drift just means that over time the< the market wants to keep going higher so the market wants to keep going higher so just< just take a look at the chart right now just take a look at the chart right now right< right just take a look at all the right just take a look at all the different< different index ETFs the broad-based different index ETFs the broad-based ones< ones look at it 10 years ago 20 years ones look at it 10 years ago 20 years ago< ago you will see that the price just is ago you will see that the price just is much< much much lower right compared to now much much lower right compared to now the< the price has just kept making new highs the price has just kept making new highs over< over the years so that is why we want to over the years so that is why we want to use< use our strategies that is you know use our strategies that is you know aligned< aligned with this uh characteristic this aligned with this uh characteristic this positive< positive drift characteristic so for the positive drift characteristic so for the most< most part we are going to be using most part we are going to be using either< either bullish or neutral to bullish either bullish or neutral to bullish kinds< kinds of strategies now you might be kinds of strategies now you might. be wondering< wondering Davis what about individual wondering Davis what about individual stocks< stocks so what I would say is that if stocks so what I would say is that if you< you are just starting out I would you are just starting out I would suggest< suggest index ETF first because they are suggest index ETF first because they are less< less volatile and we already know what less volatile and we already know what is< is the characteristic of this right it's is the characteristic of this right it's predictable< predictable in the long term we know the predictable in the long term we know the market< market just wants to keep going up so we market just wants to keep going up so we just< just need to pick our places when we are just need to pick our places when we are trading< trading this options strategy but if you trading this options strategy but if you were< were to trade individual stocks it can were to trade individual stocks it can get< get a little bit tricky because stocks get a little bit tricky because stocks cannot< cannot keep going up in the long term cannot keep going up in the long term right< right certain stocks if you choose the right certain stocks if you choose the wrong< wrong stocks let's say for example you wrong stocks let's say for example you start< start to trade those mean stocks like start to trade those mean stocks like AMC< AMC GameStop all these stocks may not AMC GameStop all these stocks may not necessarily< necessarily fit well with this option necessarily fit well with this option strategies< strategies that we are going to choose strategies that we are going to choose now< now some people might say that hey you now some people might say that hey you know< know the individual stocks have much know the individual stocks have much higher< higher volatility right higher higher volatility right higher volatility< volatility so I can get much Reacher volatility so I can get much Reacher premium< premium I can make more quickly so yes premium I can make more quickly so yes that< that is true but again what is the point that is true but again what is the point of< of higher volatility higher premium if of higher volatility higher premium if you< you can't actually keep it right that you can't actually keep it right that means< means you lose when you start to trade means you lose when you start to trade the< the strategy so for me i' rather be more the strategy so for me i' rather be more content< content with a lower volatility but I content with a lower volatility but I know< know that in the long term I have the know that in the long term I have the edge< edge that in the long term my account at edge that in the long term my account at least< least is going to grow all right okay so least is going to grow all right okay so now< now now that we've already decided on now now that we've already decided on the< the underline let us get into the option the underline let us get into the option strategies< strategies right so what are the option strategies right so what are the option strategies< strategies so the very first one so let strategies so the very first one so let me< me just first delete all this drawing so me just first delete all this drawing so the< the very first one is the most bullish the very first one is the most bullish of< of all the five strategies I'm going to of all the five strategies I'm going to share< share with you and that is none other share with you and that is none other than< than the classic vanilla short put right than the classic vanilla short put right so< so the short put is the most directional so the short put is the most directional one< one of all the strategies because you one of all the strategies because you know< know we generally want the market to go know we generally want the market to go up< up when we put it on right so the short up when we put it on right so the short putut< putut on the index ETFs uh has been you putut on the index ETFs uh has been you know< know studied a lot a lot of research as know studied a lot a lot of research as well< well and in my own experience as well well and in my own experience as well overall< overall in the long term it's a profit overall in the long term it's a profit right< right it's profitable because it makes right it's profitable because it makes sense< sense Market keeps going up the strategy sense Market keeps going up the strategy we< we use is a bullish one so for this how we use is a bullish one so for this how are< are we going to select our strike price are we going to select our strike price now< now there is actually a range of strike now there is actually a range of strike prices< prices you want to choose but generally prices you want to choose but generally for< for me personally when I choose this for me personally when I choose this short< short put strike I take a look at the short put strike I take a look at the Delta< Delta right so the Delta basically just Delta right so the Delta basically just depicts< depicts what is the probability of you depicts what is the probability of you know< know the strike being in the money uh know the strike being in the money uh expiration< expiration it also depicts basically the expiration it also depicts basically the probability< probability of win right so if you take probability of win right so if you take a< a look at the Delta down here you can a look at the Delta down here you can see< see there 0. 14 all the way to see there 0.

14 all the way to 0. 45< 0.

45 so if you were to just go to the 0. 45 so if you were to just go to the one< one right at the money so this one down one right at the money so this one down here< here is. what we call at the money here is what we call at the money because< because the current market price is because the current market price is somewhere< somewhere around 20 3.

5 right as you can somewhere around 20 3. 5 right as you can see< see over here so this is where it's at see over here so this is where it's at the< the money where you get the highest the money where you get the highest premium< premium you get the highest premium but premium you get the highest premium but the< the trade-off is that there is a higher the trade-off is that there is a higher chance< chance for this strike to actually be in. chance for this strike to actually be in the< the money at expiration which means to the money at expiration which means to say< say that a chance for you to lose money say that a chance for you to lose money so< so the probability of wind is basically so the probability of wind is basically just< just 100% minus of this right so if you just 100% minus of this right so if you see< see 45 Delta 0.

45 it just means there is see 45 Delta 0. 45 it just means there is an< an estimate of around an estimate of around 45%< 45% chance that this strike 203 will be 45% chance that this strike 203 will be in< in the money at expiration right so if in the money at expiration right so if you< you. just take 100% minus 45% it means you just take 100% minus 45% it means the< the win rate is roughly around 55% now the win rate is roughly around 55% now on< on the other end you have one that is on the other end you have one that is 0.

14< 0. 14 now by the way this is not the uh 0.

14 now by the way this is not the uh lowest< lowest Delta right as you can see. there lowest Delta right as you can see there are< are many many right so based on 0. 14 are many many right so based on 0.

14 oops< oops let me just remove this drawing oops let me just remove this drawing again< again so let's just go with okay let's again so let's just go with okay let's just< just go with the 10 Delta because quite just go with the 10 Delta because quite a< a lot of people like to you know choose a lot of people like to you know choose the< the Delta that is very far away from the the Delta that is very far away from the market< market because they don't want to get market because they don't want to get hit< hit right so as you can see down here 10 hit right so as you can see down here 10 Delta< Delta means that you have a estimate of Delta means that you. have a estimate of roughly< roughly 90% win rate so it's very high roughly 90% win rate so it's very high win< win rate many people like that but the win rate many people like that but the trade-off< trade-off is that you're going to get trade-off is that you're going to get you< you know pretty pretty low premium for you know pretty pretty low premium for that< that right at least you see if you that right at least you see if you compare< compare it to the one that is at the compare it to the one that is at the market< market let me just go all the way down market let me just go all the way down again< again you can see it's roughly again you can see it's roughly $5. 34< $5.

34 so that's quite a big difference $5. 34 so that's quite a big difference so< so we want a very good balance between so we want a very good balance between you< you know premium as well as the you know premium as well as the probability< probability of win so that is why probability of win so that is why generally< generally when it comes to the short generally when it comes to the short putut< putut strategy our go for somewhere putut strategy our go for somewhere around< around 20 to 30 Deltas that means to say around 20 to 30 Deltas that means to say you< you have a rough win rate of around 70 you have a rough win rate of around 70 to< to 80% based on you know the theoretical to 80% based on you know the theoretical pricing< pricing of the options so basically you pricing of the options so basically you can< can choose any of this strike price down can choose any of this strike price down here< here right so if you want to go for the here right so if you want to go for the one< one at 30 Deltas all you got to do just one at 30 Deltas all you got to do just click< click on this and this is the premium click on this and this is the premium that< that you're going to get right so down that you're going to get right so down here< here it says the premium is here it says the premium is $313< $313 which means to say per contract you $313 which means to say per contract you actually< actually receive actually receive $313< $313 in terms of credit because each $313 in terms of credit because each option< option controls 800 shares so this is option controls 800 shares so this is the< the first strategy called the short the first strategy called the short putut< putut now let's go to something that is putut now let's go to something that is a< a little bit more neutral so neutral a little bit more neutral so neutral strategies< strategies are also what I tend to put strategies are also what I tend to put because< because the market doesn't go up all the because the market doesn't go up all the time< time nonstop right so although its time nonstop right so although its positive< positive drift right the market goes positive drift right the market goes higher< higher over time let me just get my higher over time let me just get my marker< marker so the market just wants to go marker so the market just wants to go higher< higher over time but there are times higher over time but there are times where< where you know the market can just where you know the market can just pretty< pretty much stay still right there are pretty much stay still right there are times< times where the market can just go times where the market can just go something< something like this for a while before something like this for a while before it< it goes up right so this period of time it goes up right so this period of time using< using neutral strategies can be actually using neutral strategies can be actually pretty< pretty good as well especially we pretty good as well especially we already< already know that you know using the DTE already know that you know using the DTE that< that is more than 45 days more than 45 that is more than 45 days more than 45 DTE DTE DTE we< we know that the realized move is most we know that the realized move is most often< often time lesser than the expected move often time lesser than the expected move so< so that's our Edge when we are trading so that's our Edge when we are trading neutral< neutral strategies so what is this neutral strategies so what is this neutral< neutral strategy so for me personally I neutral strategy so for me personally I like< like to trade the strangle so the like to trade the strangle so the strangle< strangle basically is just a short putut strangle basically is just a short putut and< and a short call combined now if you are and a short call combined now if you are new< new to trading options this is new to trading options this is definitely< definitely not something you want to get definitely not something you want to get into< into right at the start but I'm just into right at the start but I'm just sharing< sharing with you the strategies that I sharing with you the strategies that I personally< personally use so the the short strangle personally use so the the short strangle the< the way that I trade it generally I the way that I trade it generally I trade< trade the expected move so what is the trade the expected move so what is the expected< expected move so the expected move expected move so the expected move generally< generally means it's around 16 Delta so generally means it's around 16 Delta so we< we choose the short strikes around 16 we choose the short strikes around 16 Deltas< Deltas right so 16 Delta so we go for Deltas right so 16 Delta so we go for somewhere< somewhere around here so you have 189 somewhere around here so you have 189 and< and you go all the way to the other side and you go all the way to the other side which< which is the call side and you go for which is the call side and you go for the< the 16 Delta right 16 Delta let's go a the 16 Delta right 16 Delta let's go a little< little bit more downwards all right so little bit more downwards all right so we< we can see this is 16 Delta down here so we can see this is 16 Delta down here so I< I will go with this so as you can see I will go with this so as you can see down< down here this is the strangle so down here this is the strangle so slightly< slightly different strategy from the slightly different strategy from the short< short putut because the short putut short putut because the short putut slightly< slightly more bullish strangle we want slightly more bullish strangle we want the< the market to pretty much just bounce the market to pretty much just bounce back< back and forth within our range down back and forth within our range down here< here right within this uh strangle here right within this uh strangle strikes< strikes now for those of you who have a strikes now for those of you who have a smaller< smaller account you're not able to trade smaller account you're not able to trade the< the strangle then you can go for the the strangle then you can go for the defined< defined risk version of the strangle defined risk version of the strangle which< which is essentially called the iron which is. essentially called the iron Condor< Condor right the iron Condor just Condor right the iron Condor just basically< basically is similar to this right you basically is similar to this right you have< have the two short strikes now all you have the two short strikes now all you got< got to do is to buy the long Wings right got to do is to buy the long Wings right so< so for example you buy the long Wings so for example you buy the long Wings down< down here and on the other end you buy down here and on the other end you buy the< the long wings as well so let us go for the long wings as well so let us go for the< the same uh equivalent width down here the same uh equivalent width down here so< so down here is four points wide so the so down here is four points wide so the other< other side we also want to build one other side we also want to build one that< that is four points wide so that would that is four points wide so that would be< be roughly 185 so this way you have a be roughly 185 so this way you have a very< very even iron Condor construct now that very even iron Condor construct now that is< is not to say that you must go for Four is not to say that you must go for Four Points< Points wide or how many points wide Points wide or how many points wide right< right ultimately this comes down to your right ultimately this comes down to your own< own risk tolerance right so two ways to own risk tolerance right so two ways to do< do this if you're the type that likes to do this if you're the type that likes to have< have you know a fixed width every time have you know a fixed width every time then< then you can go for a fixed you know $5 then you can go for a fixed you know $5 width< width and based on your you know risk width and based on your you know risk allocation< allocation maybe you have to increase allocation maybe you have to increase the< the contract to fit your risk now the the contract to fit your risk now the other< other way would be to just expand the other way would be to just expand the wings< wings to fit your risk allocation so wings to fit your risk allocation so maybe< maybe if your risk allocation is maybe if your risk allocation is somewhere< somewhere around maybe close to $11,000 somewhere around maybe close to $11,000 then< then you want to go 10 points wide 189 then you want to go 10 points wide 189 you< you go 10 points wi will be 179 and on you go 10 points wi will be 179 and on the< the other end same thing go 10 points y the other end same thing go 10 points y now< now if you do not have any 10 points y now if you do not have any 10 points y down< down here then you got to start to make down here then you got to start to make a< a decision right so maybe you just go a decision right so maybe you just go for< for nine points white down here and on for nine points white down here and on the< the other end you adjust or you can just the other end you adjust or you can just leave< leave it as well as a skew iron Condor leave it as well as a skew iron Condor okay< okay so back to the strangle so what I okay so back to the strangle so what I want< want to share with you is that the want to share with you is that the strangle< strangle also has been you know strangle also has been you know thoroughly< thoroughly studied thoroughly tested by thoroughly studied thoroughly tested by the< the tasty trade team there's a lot of the tasty trade team there's a lot of research< research on their s you can just go research on their s you can just go there< there and find out and you can see that there and find out and you can see that over< over the long term the strangle also has over the long term the strangle also has a< a positive expectancy right it's net a positive expectancy right it's net profitable< profitable over the long term over many profitable over the long term over many years< years right so again when we are putting years right so again when we are putting on< on any of these strategies look out for on any of these strategies look out for the< the next 100 or more trades rather than the next 100 or more trades rather than the< the next you know five to 10 trades the next you know five to 10 trades because< because 5 to 10 trades you can still be because 5 to 10 trades you can still be in< in a loss now let's get into the third in a loss now let's get into the third strategy< strategy so for the first strategy we strategy so for the first strategy we have< have a bullish strategy second one we have a bullish strategy second one we have< have a neutral strategy now the third have a neutral strategy now the third fourth< fourth and fifth this is where we're fourth and fifth this is where we're going< going to go for omnidirectional going to go for omnidirectional strategies< strategies so omnidirectional strategies strategies so omnidirectional strategies are< are also one of my favorite strategies are also one of my favorite strategies to< to trade because it is pretty versatile to trade because it is pretty versatile and< and it gives you a little form of and it gives you a little form of insurance< insurance right so let me just show you

#### Topic 1

com blueprint all right back with davis. com blueprint all right back to< to the video so the very third strategy to the video so the very third strategy which< which is the first of the which is the first of the omnidirectional< omnidirectional strategies I'm going to omnidirectional strategies I'm going to share< share with you is What's called the Jade share with you is What's called the Jade lizard< lizard right so the Jade lizard is lizard right so the Jade lizard is pretty< pretty much a combination of two pretty much a combination of two strategies< strategies right the very first strategy strategies right the very first strategy we< we have the short putut so we have we have the short putut so we have already< already talked about the short putut the already talked about the short putut the very< very first strategy so the J lizard very first strategy so the J lizard consists< consists of a short putut so for this consists of a short putut so for this I'm< I'm just going to choose the expected I'm just going to choose the expected move< move which is 16 Delta and then on the move which is 16 Delta and then on the other< other side you have a call spread right other side you have a call spread right you< you have a call spread which is a bare you have a call spread which is a bare call< call spread so for the bare call spread call spread so for the bare call spread you< you can choose somewhere around 32 35 you can choose somewhere around 32 35 Deltas< Deltas somewhere around here right so Deltas somewhere around here right so let's< let's say we go for the one around 36 let's say we go for the one around 36 Deltas< Deltas 211 and then let's go for the 212 Deltas 211 and then let's go for the 212 strike< strike so you might be wondering why is strike so you might be wondering why is there< there a call spread right so the call there a call spread right so the call spread< spread down here is to add additional spread down here is to add additional credit< credit to your overall strategy because credit to your overall strategy because if< if you were to just take a look at the if you were to just take a look at the short< short put down here you may only get short put down here you may only get a147< a147 but if you were to at this call a147 but if you were to at this call Credit< Credit spread down here you can get an Credit spread down here you can get an additional< additional credit right so overall you additional credit right so overall you get< get more premium than just selling the get more premium than just selling the sh< sh putut alone so also this shows that sh putut alone so also this shows that there< there is a Delta of around 36 Delta there is a Delta of around 36 Delta which< which means to say you know not all the which means to say you know not all the time< time the market will actually go above time the market will actually go above this< this strike price there are times right this strike price there are times right where< where the market will actually stay where the market will actually stay below< below 211 and above this short strike below 211 and above this short strike down< down here and this is where your maximum down here and this is where your maximum profit< profit is going to be so as you can see profit is going to be so as you can see down< down here this serves as a little form down here this serves as a little form of< of a hedge in case the market comes down of a hedge in case the market comes down right< right or if the market doesn't actually right or if the market doesn't actually go< go up that much so this can actually go up that much so this can actually help< help you in case let's say the market help you in case let's say the market goes< goes a little bit much closer to where goes a little bit much closer to where your< your short stru is hey at least you have your short stru is hey at least you have a< a form of a mini hatch the call crit a form of a mini hatch the call crit spread< spread is making some profit over there spread is making some profit over there so< so straight away when we take a look at so straight away when we take a look at this< this structure the first thing you want this structure the first thing you want to< to see is that your credit is actually to see is that your credit is actually more< more than this credit spread down here more than this credit spread down here this< this Core Credit spread has a $1 width this Core Credit spread has a $1 width that< that means to say the max loss for this that means to say the max loss for this Core< Core Credit WID is $1 so your premium Core Credit WID is $1 so your premium you< you want it to be more than $1 and you want it to be more than $1 and what's< what's the reason for that the reason is what's the reason for that the reason is because< because we do not want any risk to the because we do not want any risk to the upside< upside right that means to say if the upside right that means to say if the market< market goes all the way up you still can market goes all the way up you still can get< get a profit so how you know that is get a profit so how you know that is simply< simply by taking a look at this uh simply by taking a look at this uh premium< premium down here it has to be more than premium down here it has to be more than the< the call width down here now if you want the call width down here now if you want to< to be sure whether there is no risk to to be sure whether there is no risk to the< the upsite then this is where you want the upsite then this is where you want to< to go to the p&amp;l graph so as you can see to go to the p&amp;l graph so as you can see this< this is the p&amp;l graph of the J lizard this is the p&amp;l graph of the J lizard right< right as you can see our call Credit right as you can see our call Credit spread< spread is on the right hand side down spread is on the right hand side down here< here this is currently where the market here this is currently where the market price<. price is this is where the market price price is this is where the market price and< and then on the left hand side this is and then on the left hand side this is where< where our short putut is so as you can where our short putut is so as you can see< see this forms a structure that where see this forms a structure that where you< you have a Max profit Zone somewhere in you have a Max profit Zone somewhere in the< the middle and as you can see even the middle and as you can see even though< though if the market continues to go up though if the market continues to go up to< to the right hand side that's where you to the right hand side that's where you know< know the market starts to go higher know the market starts to go higher there< there is no risk to the upside right so there is no risk to the upside right so this< this is a pretty good strategy that I this is a pretty good strategy that I like< like to use as well it's called the Jade like to use as well it's called the Jade lizard< lizard so if you're not too bullish lizard so if you're not too bullish you're< you're thinking that hey maybe the you're thinking that hey maybe the market< market has a chance to go down a little market has a chance to go down a little bit< bit then this jet lizard can be pretty bit then this jet lizard can be pretty good< good and this jet lizard is actually good and this jet lizard is actually pretty< pretty flexible in its construction so pretty flexible in its construction so for< for example if you want it to be a for example if you want it to be a little< little bit more defensive that means you little bit more defensive that means you want< want to get more profits inside this Max want to get more profits inside this Max profit< profit Zone what you can do is widen out profit Zone what you can do is widen out this< this call Credit spread so for example this call Credit spread so for example let< let me just shift one more point out and let me just shift one more point out and you< you can see over here we just managed to you can see over here we just managed to make< make it a $210 credit on a $2 width make it a $210 credit on a $2 width which< which means to say that there is still which means to say that there is still no< no risk to the upside and on the upside no risk to the upside and on the upside let's< let's say for example Market goes past let's say for example Market goes past the< the call Credit spread you at least the call Credit spread you at least still< still have you know $10 not a lot but still have you know $10 not a lot but hey< hey if the market stays within this hey if the market stays within this profit< profit Zone then you're going to make a profit Zone then you're going to make a little< little bit more and that as you can see little bit more and that as you can see over< over here is over here is $210< $210 compared to previously it's around $210 compared to previously it's around $180< $180 I think $180 on the right hand side $180 I think $180 on the right hand side is< is $80 and then over here if I change to is $80 and then over here if I change to 213< 213 it's slightly more 210 and on the 213 it's slightly more 210 and on the upside< upside it's $10 so this really is up to upside it's $10 so this really is up to you< you to design you know a construct that you to design you know a construct that you< you like and you feel comfortable with you like and you feel comfortable with all< all right so now let's get into the all right so now let's get into the fourth< fourth strategy also another fourth strategy also another omnidirectional< omnidirectional strategy and another omnidirectional strategy and another strategy< strategy I really like a lot it's What's strategy I really like a lot it's What's called< called the wide put ratio spread or called the wide put ratio spread or rather< rather it's a term that I coined myself rather it's a term that I coined myself because< because there isn't exactly you know a because there isn't exactly you know a formal< formal name for this strategy I call it formal name for this strategy I call it the< the Y put ratio spread mainly because it the Y put ratio spread mainly because it resembles< resembles a put ratio spread but the resembles a put ratio spread but the strikes< strikes are slightly apart from each strikes are slightly apart from each other< other so here's what I mean so first other so here's what I mean so first thing< thing again we want to construct where thing again we want to construct where our< our short putut is so it's a combination our short putut is so it's a combination of< of two strategies the very first one of two strategies the very first one again< again is a short putut and then on the again is a short putut and then on the other< other end right now this time we're other end right now this time we're going< going to still stick to the put option going to still stick to the put option right< right we're going to stick to the put right we're going to stick to the put option< option and this time we're going to use option and this time we're going to use this< this credit that we received $148 and this credit that we received $148 and we're< we're going to use part of it to buy a we're going to use part of it to buy a put< put debit spread so the put debit spread put debit spread so the put debit spread we< we want to buy somewhere around at the we want to buy somewhere around at the market< market so maybe we go for this one one market so maybe we go for this one one and< and let's see how wide we can go let's and let's see how wide we can go let's see< see if we go for two points wide we are see if we go for two points wide we are able< able to still get a credit right so with able to still get a credit right so with this< this we have 62 cents credit if we this we have 62 cents credit if we remove< remove this uh put debit spread we have remove this uh put debit spread we have roughly< roughly about $1.

50 so means to say we roughly about $1. 50 so means to say we use< use roughly about half to purchase this use roughly about half to purchase this put< put debit spread so this put debit put debit spread so this put debit spread< spread serves as a form of an insurance spread serves as a form of an insurance as< as well right so you notice it's as well right so you notice it's something< something similar to the Jade lizard but something similar to the Jade lizard but the< the difference here is that with this the difference here is that with this put< put debit spread we actually have put debit spread we actually have slightly< slightly more protection and more credit slightly more protection and more credit up< up front because the max profit zone is up front because the max profit zone is not< not going to be as wide right so let's not going to be as wide right so let's get< get into the p&amp;l graph again so as you get into the p&amp;l graph again so as you can< can see this is the p&amp;l graph for what I can see this is the p&amp;l graph for what I call< call the wide put ratio spread now call the wide put ratio spread now previously< previously we have the Jade lizard previously we have the Jade lizard whereby< whereby the uh construct was stretched whereby the uh construct was stretched out< out slightly further down here now if out slightly further down here now if you< you recall for the call Credit spread you recall for the call Credit spread when< when we constructed this uh two points when we constructed this uh two points wide< wide credit spread we only get about $10 wide credit spread we only get about $10 on< on the upside right although we get a on the upside right although we get a much< much you know bigger profit zone now for much you know bigger profit zone now for this< this white put ratio spread although you this white put ratio spread although you have< have a slightly smaller Max profit Zone have a slightly smaller Max profit Zone but< but the minimum profit you can get once but the minimum profit you can get once the< the market goes past this point down the market goes past this point down here< here you can get roughly about 62 cents here you can get roughly about 62 cents which< which is $62 per construct so as you can which is $62 per construct so as you can see< see this is trade-off and I like to put see this is trade-off and I like to put this< this on when I'm a little bit more this on when I'm a little bit more defensive< defensive right so most likely the defensive right so most likely the market< market has gone up a little bit and I market has gone up a little bit and I want< want to be a little bit more defensive want to be a little bit more defensive rather< rather than go with the J lizard so this rather than go with the J lizard so this is< is where I will put on the wi put ratio is where I will put on the wi put ratio spread< spread as you can see they are pretty spread as you can see they are pretty similar< similar to each other but the white put similar to each other but the white put ratio< ratio spread gives you a little bit more ratio spread gives you a little bit more defense< defense because as you can see down here defense because as you can see down here when< when the market comes down you can get when the market comes down you can get about about about $262< $262 now if you want to get a little bit $262 now if you want to get a little bit more< more defensive you can actually stretch more defensive you can actually stretch this< this to maybe one more point wide so let this to maybe one more point wide so let us< us try that so for this we need to buy us try that so for this we need to buy the< the debit spread that is three points the debit spread that is three points wide< wide instead of two points wide so let wide instead of two points wide so let us< us change the strike down here to 200 us change the strike down here to 200 and< and see what we can get all right so as and see what we can get all right so as you< you can see let me just remove this you can see let me just remove this drawing< drawing we can actually now get drawing we can actually now get $324< $324 if the market actually settles $324 if the market actually settles below< below where the current market price is below where the current market price is right< right you can see down here if the right you can see down here if the market< market goes down settle somewhere within market goes down settle somewhere within this< this Max profit Zone we get much more this Max profit Zone we get much more than< than the jet lizard right the jet lizard than the jet lizard right the jet lizard is< is somewhere around 210 at the most this is somewhere around 210 at the most this is< is 324 and if the market goes up hey at is 324 and if the market goes up hey at least< least we still get $24 so this is the least we still get $24 so this is the wide< wide put ratio spread all right so let's wide put ratio spread all right so let's go< go to our fifth and final option go to our fifth and final option strategy< strategy another option strategy that I strategy another option strategy that I really< really like to put on a lot and that is really like to put on a lot and that is the< the put ratio spread so previously we the put ratio spread so previously we talked< talked about the wi put ratio spread now talked about the wi put ratio spread now let's< let's talk about the actual one the put let's talk about the actual one the put ratio< ratio spread so again how it starts off ratio spread so again how it starts off with< with is pretty much we just want to with is pretty much we just want to select< select the short put strike so the short select the short put strike so the short put< put strike around the expected move put strike around the expected move right< right this can be 16 to 20 Deltas so right this can be 16 to 20 Deltas so let's< let's say for example let's stay let's say for example let's stay consistent< consistent let's go with the 16 Delta consistent let's go with the 16 Delta now< now once you have already found the shut now once you have already found the shut again< again we're going to use this credit to again we're going to use this credit to buy< buy a put debit spread right but the buy a put debit spread right but the difference< difference right now is that the put difference right now is that the put debit< debit spread is no longer going to be at debit spread is no longer going to be at the< the money down here but rather we're the money down here but rather we're going< going to share. the same short strike as going to share the same short strike as this< this 189 short put down here so that this 189 short put down here so that means< means now I need to change this to two means now I need to change this to two so< so we've already gotten the short leg of so we've already gotten the short leg of the< the put debit spread the embedded put the put debit spread the embedded put deit< deit spread now we need to find the long deit spread now we need to find the long leg< leg so we want to find the long leg all leg so we want to find the long leg all we< we got to do is just experiment with the we got to do is just experiment with the strikes< strikes to see how far we can get so strikes to see how far we can get so let's< let's say let's go for around maybe 5 let's say let's go for around maybe 5 point< point Y first so for this I'm going to point Y first so for this I'm going to change< change this to one because mainly that's change this to one because mainly that's how< how this platform works this is the how this platform works this is the think< think of swim web platform if you use think of swim web platform if you use the< the desktop platform you won't have this the desktop platform you won't have this issue< issue right so for this basically you issue right so for this basically you can< can see that if I construct it this way can see that if I construct it this way I< I still get a 59 cents credit and now I still get a 59 cents credit and now you< you notice my put debit spread is you notice my put debit spread is actually< actually pretty wide compared to the actually pretty wide compared to the wide< wide put ratio spread so the wide put wide put ratio spread so the wide put ratio< ratio spread it gets this name because ratio spread it gets this name because it< it has a much wider Max profit Zone it has a much wider Max profit Zone compared< compared to the put ratio spread so this compared to the put ratio spread so this is< is the put ratio spread so you notice is the put ratio spread so you notice that< that it has this tent like structure that it has this tent like structure down< down here so I call this the tent this down here so I call this the tent this is< is pretty much where the max profit zone is pretty much where the max profit zone is< is where you know as it settles is where you know as it settles somewhere< somewhere inside the tent you can get somewhere inside the tent you can get you< you know quite a pretty good profit so you know quite a pretty good profit so the< the difference between this and the wi the difference between this and the wi put< put ratio spread is the profit zone so put ratio spread is the profit zone so the< the profit zone of the wi put ratio the profit zone of the wi put ratio spread< spread you will notice is going to be spread you will notice is going to be slightly< slightly wider however the max profit is slightly wider however the max profit is lower< lower now for this p ratio spread you lower now for this p ratio spread you have< have an opportunity to actually make have an opportunity to actually make much< much more right so if you were to take a much more right so if you were to take a look< look at the highest point the Pinnacle look at the highest point the Pinnacle of< of this 10 down here you can see you can of this 10 down here you can see you can actually< actually get up to over $500 right for actually get up to over $500 right for the< the white put ratio spread maybe the white put ratio spread maybe somewhere< somewhere around $300 so this is just a somewhere around $300 so this is just a trade-off< trade-off but both strategies I still trade-off but both strategies I still like< like them a lot and the put ratio spread like them a lot and the put ratio spread I< I really use it as something very I really use it as something very defensive< defensive that means to say if the defensive that means to say if the market< market was to go up from where the market was to go up from where the current< current market price is although I don't current market price is although I don't make< make that much on the put ratio spread make that much on the put ratio spread but< but hey my overall portfolio is still but hey my overall portfolio is still going< going to go up right and then if the going to go up right and then if the market< market comes down I have this put ratio market comes down I have this put ratio spread< spread to potentially capture any move spread to potentially capture any move on< on the downside right so if it comes on the downside right so if it comes down< down hopefully this put ratio spread it down hopefully this put ratio spread it goes< goes inside the max profit Zone then goes inside the max profit Zone then that's< that's where I can have you know some that's where I can have you know some sort< sort of a profit from the market moving sort of a profit from the market moving down< down rather than you know I have nothing down rather than you know I have nothing at< at all right so that is why I also like at all right so that is why I also like the< the put ratio spread a lot so these are the put ratio spread a lot so these are the< the five winning option strategies that the five winning option strategies that have< have been doing pretty well for me so have been doing pretty well for me so consider< consider using it and I hope it does consider using it and I hope it does well< well for you as well and if you like well for you as well and if you like this< this video I greatly appreciate if you this video I greatly appreciate if you give< give me

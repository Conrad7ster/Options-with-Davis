=======================================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about how to we're going to be talking about how to generate< generate safe weekly passive incomes generate safe weekly passive incomes with< with options now we want to find option with options now we want to find option strategy< strategy that can actually satisfy you strategy that can actually satisfy you know< know three keywords that are mentioned know three keywords that are mentioned here< here so what are the three keywords here so what are the three keywords right< right the very first keyword is the word right the very first keyword is the word safe< safe right so as much as possible we safe right so as much as possible we want< want to find a strategy that is much want to find a strategy that is much safer< safer than you know most other option safer than you know most other option strategies< strategies because in the world of strategies because in the world of options< options there are many many many options there are many many many different< different strategies right and some of different strategies right and some of them< them are safer some of them are riskier them are safer some of them are riskier now< now when I use the term safe it doesn't now when I use the term safe it doesn't mean< mean that you totally eliminate all risk mean that you totally eliminate all risk in< in the strategy right because it's not in the strategy right because it's not possible< possible when you're putting money into possible when you're putting money into the< the market there will always be some the market there will always be some sort< sort of risk otherwise you know sort of risk otherwise you know everybody< everybody will be just wanting to put everybody will be just wanting to put their< their money into these kind of options their money into these kind of options which< which is which doesn't make sense right which is which doesn't make sense right so< so safe in the sense whereby we so safe in the sense whereby we eliminate< eliminate as much risk as possible where eliminate as much risk as possible where there's< there's much higher chance of you there's much higher chance of you winning< winning winning then losing so that's winning winning then losing so that's the< the very first keyword that is safe now the very first keyword that is safe now the< the second keyword is Weekly right that the second keyword is Weekly right that means< means to say we want to have a strategy means to say we want to have a strategy that< that actually realizes a profit you know that actually realizes a profit you know each< each week right so if you've been each week right so if you've been watching< watching most of my videos you notice watching most of my videos you notice that< that most of my videos are actually that most of my videos are actually talking< talking about longer time frames right talking about longer time frames right around< around the 45 DTE Mark which means to around the 45 DTE Mark which means to say< say you want to choose an option that say you want to choose an option that has< has the expiry of around 45 days or so has the expiry of around 45 days or so so< so that is not exactly week right so that is not exactly week right because< because it takes quite some time for you because it takes quite some time for you to< to finally realize that profit so for to finally realize that profit so for this< this video I'm going to focus on a this video I'm going to focus on a strategy< strategy that can actually let you have strategy that can actually let you have a< a weekly profit right that means at the a weekly profit right that means at the end< end of the week you're able to realize end of the week you're able to realize some< some sort of profit now the third some sort of profit now the third keyword< keyword is passive income now the true keyword is passive income now the true meaning< meaning of passive income really is that meaning of passive income really is that you< you do the work once and then the income you do the work once and then the income just< just keeps coming over and over again just keeps coming over and over again right< right so for example if you put into a right so for example if you put into a let's< let's say you put it into like just let's say you put it into like just bonds< bonds so to speak right and then if you bonds so to speak right and then if you put< put into bonds the interest will just put into bonds the interest will just keep< keep paying you for as long as you keep keep paying you for as long as you keep the< the bonds right now when it comes to the bonds right now when it comes to options< options we can't actually have something options we can't actually have something like< like a pure passive income because you like a pure passive income because you would< would have to keep on putting the would have to keep on putting the options< options so when it comes to options the options so when it comes to options the way< way that I see passive income is whereby way that I see passive income is whereby you< you put on the strategy once and then you put on the. strategy once and then you< you just leave it all the way to you just leave it all the way to expiration< expiration right that means to say there expiration right that means to say there is< is no management all right so these are is no management all right so these are the< the three keywords we're going to find a the three keywords we're going to find a strategy< strategy that is safe whereby you have strategy that is safe whereby you have higher< higher chance of winning weekly whereby higher chance of winning weekly whereby you're< you're able to realize a profit at the you're able to realize a profit at the end< end of the week and then passive income end of the week and then passive income whereby< whereby we are pretty much just going to whereby we are pretty much just going to put< put it once UPF front and then after put it once UPF front and then after that< that we're not going to touch it and that we're not going to touch it and leave< leave it and see you know what is the leave it and see you know what is the income< income that we can get at the end that income that we can get at the end that means< means we're going to leave the options means we're going to leave the options all< all the way to expiration so what is all the way to expiration so what is this< this strategy well this strategy is none this strategy well this strategy is none other< other than what I call the income grid other than what I call the income grid real< real strategy so the income grid real real strategy so the income grid real strategy< strategy is a variation of the strategy is a variation of the traditional< traditional wheel strategy and I've traditional wheel strategy and I've created< created you know a few videos on this created you know a few videos on this already< already but I want to just reiterate already but I want to just reiterate this< this in how we can use the income GD this in how we can use the income GD wheel< wheel strategy to actually generate a wheel strategy to actually generate a safe< safe weekly passive income for you all safe weekly passive income for you all right< right so first of all if you're not right so first of all if you're not familiar< familiar with what the traditional wheel familiar with what the traditional wheel strategy< strategy is is basically just this right strategy is is basically just this right so< so you start off by selling a cash so you start off by selling a cash secure< secure put which means to say you secure put which means to say you actually< actually intend to get exercise on it actually intend to get exercise on it you< you intend to get assigned on it and you intend to get assigned on it and then< then get the underlying shares right so then get the underlying shares right so if< if you get assign on a cash secure put if you get assign on a cash secure put which< which is a short putut option well for which is a short putut option well for every< every short putut option that you have every short putut option that you have on< on if you assign you're going to be long on if you assign you're going to be long 100< 100 shares right so let's say for 100 shares right so let's say for example< example the market comes down and at example the market comes down and at expiration< expiration if you're assigned you're now expiration if you're assigned you're now long< long 100 shares per contract right so long 100 shares per contract right so that's< that's the very first stage of this uh that's the very first stage of this uh traditional< traditional wheel strategy pretty simple traditional wheel strategy pretty simple right< right now the next stage is that once right now the next stage is that once you've< you've already got ass signed on the you've already got ass signed on the shares< shares you can start to sell a covered shares you can start to sell a covered call< call right now this cover call basically call right now this cover call basically you< you can either sell it at the money you can either sell it at the money which< which is pretty much at the same price which is pretty much at the same price where< where you got assigned at so for example where you got assigned at so for example if< if you sold the cash to food at $19 then if you sold the cash to food at $19 then add< add the money would just simply be add the money would just simply be you're< you're selling a cover call at the same you're selling a cover call at the same price< price $19 now the other way you can do price $19 now the other way you can do that< that is that you can sell it out of the that is that you can sell it out of the money< money right out of the money that means money right out of the money that means above< above where you're assigned at right so above where you're assigned at right so if< if you're assigned at $9 you want to if you're assigned at $9 you want to sell< sell a covered call anywhere above that sell a covered call anywhere above that so< so in this example as you can see I talk so in this example as you can see I talk about< about selling you know at $19. 50 that's about selling you know at $19.

50 that's where< where you can sell your cover call so where you can sell your cover call so not< not only do you get the premium but if not only do you get the premium but if the< the market actually goes up and get you the market actually goes up and get you assigned< assigned on your cover call right what assigned on your cover call right what happens< happens is that your shares get CAU away happens is that your shares get CAU away right< right if your shares get CAU away you right if your shares get CAU away you now< now have no position and you simply just now have no position and you simply just repeat< repeat the process right so as you can repeat the process right so as you can see< see down here there is a few you know see down here there is a few you know income< income sources that you have just from income sources that you have just from this< this traditional wheel strategy so first this traditional wheel strategy so first of< of all you got it from selling your cash of all you got it from selling your cash secure< secure put you get the premium from secure put you get the premium from selling< selling that after that once you selling that after that once you assigned< assigned you. get the shares you sell the assigned you get the shares you sell the cover< cover call you're going to get another cover call you're going to get another you< you know premium right you sell it you you know premium right you sell it you get< get credit for this cover call now if get credit for this cover call now if you< you were to sell it at the money and if you were to sell it at the money and if you're< you're assigned then this is pretty much you're assigned then this is pretty much the< the only income that you're going to get the only income that you're going to get right< right just from selling the cash C food right just from selling the cash C food and< and a cover call but if you were to sell and a cover call but if you were to sell it< it out of the money then you're going to it out of the money then you're going to get< get an additional you know income stream get an additional you know income stream and< and that is by having the capital gains and that is by having the capital gains right< right so basically you were long at $19 right so basically you were long at $19 and< and then you sell it at and then you sell it at $19. 50< $19.

50 so you're going to have a capital $19. 50 so you're going to have a capital gain< gain of 50 right and you turns that by gain of 50 right and you turns that by 100< 100 shares that is an additional $50 100 shares that is an additional $50 right< right let's say for example if you were right let's say for example if you were going< going for just one contract right so going for just one contract right so that< that is basically the traditional wheel that is basically the traditional wheel strategy< strategy now there is one problem with strategy now there is one problem with the< the traditional wheel strategy and this the traditional wheel strategy and this is< is something that quite a number of is something that quite a number of people< people have experienced and I'm pretty people have experienced and I'm pretty sure< sure you have experienced it if you have sure you have experienced it if you have been< been doing the wheel strategy been doing the wheel strategy somewhere< somewhere around 2022 right so if we did somewhere around 2022 right so if we did it< it somewhere around 2022 where the it somewhere around 2022 where the market< market started to go down again and the market started to go down again and the market< market pretty much was in a bare Market market pretty much was in a bare Market what< what happens is that you'll be stuck what happens is that you'll be stuck with< with this position down here right so with this position down here right so you< you may have sold a cash Rec put and you may have sold a cash Rec put and then< then the market just keeps going down so then the market just keeps going down so if< if the market goes way below your cash if the market goes way below your cash secure< secure put and never goes back up then secure put and never goes back up then you< you could be stuck in the position you could be stuck in the position indefinitely< indefinitely which is what many people indefinitely which is what many people found< found themselves in right they have found themselves in right they have gotten< gotten you know quite a number of gotten you know quite a number of positions< positions whereby you know the market positions whereby you know the market has< has dropped way below where they have has dropped way below where they have been< been assigned the shares right so what been assigned the shares right so what they< they can only do at the point of time is they can only do at the point of time is to< to just hold on to it and what happens to just hold on to it and what happens if< if the market continues to go down then if the market continues to go down then you< you could lose even more especially if you could lose even more especially if you're< you're trading you know on margin and you're trading you know on margin and you're< you're not you know paying 100% cash for you're not you know paying 100% cash for the< the shares right so this is one of the the shares right so this is one of the big< big issues with the traditional wheel big issues with the traditional wheel strategy< strategy and this is actually multiplied strategy and this is actually multiplied because< because a lot of people actually have because a lot of people actually have this< this wheel strategy on multiple stocks this wheel strategy on multiple stocks right< right if you have Stock A B C D and then right if you have Stock A B C D and then you< you pretty much entered all of them at you pretty much entered all of them at the< the same time well in 2022 you'll find the same time well in 2022 you'll find that< that all your positions would be in a that all your positions would be in a very< very very big draw down right in certain very very big draw down right in certain cases< cases some people who are in margin they cases some people who are in margin they have< have actually emailed me whereby you have actually emailed me whereby you know< know they've caught in a position and know they've caught in a position and they< they are reaching the point where they are reaching the point where there's< there's going to be a margin call so at there's going to be a margin call so at the< the point of time the broker is going to the point of time the broker is going to eliminate< eliminate the position and you're going eliminate the position and you're going to< to realize that loss which is not going to realize that loss which is not going to< to be good so this is the one big to be good so this is the one big problem< problem that you have with traditional problem that you have with traditional wheel< wheel strategy so how do you actually wheel strategy so how do you actually make< make it safe right what is the solution make it safe right what is the solution to< to this to make it safe a a safer wheel to this to make it safe a a safer wheel strategy< strategy well the answer is the income strategy well the answer is the income grid< grid wheel strategy right so basically grid wheel strategy right so basically how< how it works is that instead of just how it works is that instead of just selling< selling one level right like the selling one level right like the traditional< traditional wheel strategy what we're traditional wheel strategy what we're going< going to do with the income grid wheel going to do with the income grid wheel strategy< strategy is that we are going to sell at strategy is that we are going to sell at multiple< multiple levels right so every level multiple levels right so every level down< down here as you can see level one level down here as you can see level one level two< two level three so on and so forth all two level three so on and so forth all these< these are what I call the income grid these are what I call the income grid levels< levels right so you want to space them levels right so you want to space them apart< apart right be 50 cents apart a dollar apart right be 50 cents apart a dollar apart< apart $5 apart this all really depends apart $5 apart this all really depends on< on the price of the underlying that on the price of the underlying that you're< you're trading the price of the stock so you're trading the price of the stock so just< just as an example you can see down here just as an example you can see down here this< this is on AT&amp;T and by the way I'm not this is on AT&amp;T and by the way I'm not doing< doing this on AT&amp;T right I'm not doing doing this on AT&amp;T right I'm not doing the< the income G will strategy on AT&amp;T I'm the income G will strategy on AT&amp;T I'm just< just using it as an example because many just using it as an example because many people< people you know may not necessarily have people you know may not necessarily have a< a very big account so this is a pretty a very big account so this is a pretty you< you know low price stock whereby quite a you know low price stock whereby quite a lot< lot of people could just get their feet lot of people could just get their feet wet< wet right but again this is not a wet right but again this is not a recommendation< recommendation for you to get into AT&amp;T recommendation for you to get into AT&amp;T okay< okay just make that clear now so for okay just make that clear now so for this< this what you want to do is that you this what you want to do is that you have< have multiple levels where you're have multiple levels where you're selling< selling this cash secut so that you do selling this cash secut so that you do not< not get caught in just one level right not get caught in just one level right so< so most people what they do is that they so most people what they do is that they will< will split up their Capital into will split up their Capital into different< different stocks right so if you have different stocks right so if you have let's< let's say for example uh split your let's say for example uh split your Capital< Capital into five separate stocks right Capital into five separate stocks right if< if you entered all them at the same time if you entered all them at the same time the< the market crashes you're going to get the market crashes you're going to get stuck< stuck on all of them so instead of stuck on all of them so instead of separating< separating it into five different stocks separating it into five different stocks what< what you want to do instead is you what you want to do instead is you separate< separate your Capital into five separate your Capital into five different< different levels and then from here you different levels and then from here you can< can see that if the market actually can see that if the market actually drops< drops let's say for example it drops drops let's say for example it drops down< down here well guess what you still down here well guess what you still always< always have something to do you can keep always have something to do you can keep selling< selling your cash Caro and if you keep selling your cash Caro and if you keep getting< getting a sign your average price keeps getting a sign your average price keeps going< going uh lower as well so it makes it going uh lower as well so it makes it easier< easier for you to actually profit as the easier for you to actually profit as the market< market goes up or if you want to get out market goes up or if you want to get out of< of the stock it's easy for you to you of the stock it's easy. for you to you know< know just sell at a break even price know just sell at a break even price rather< rather than having you know your rather than having you know your position< position all stuck at the top level position all stuck at the top level right< right because if the market just keeps right because if the market just keeps going< going down and you have multiple levels going down and you have multiple levels well< well basically you're going to have many well basically you're going to have many times< times you can keep selling your cash cut times you can keep selling your cash cut and< and your covered call so let me just and your covered call so let me just show< show you exactly how that works right so show you exactly how that works right so you< you start off by just selling off the you start off by just selling off the first< first level so you do not sell all level first level so you do not sell all level at< at once right and the main reason is at once right and the main reason is because< because if you were to sell all level at because if you were to sell all level at once< once you're going to find that at Lev once you're going to find that at Lev level< level two 3 4 5 you're not going to have level two 3 4 5 you're not going to have that< that much premium at all right because that much premium at all right because it's< it's just too out of the money just too it's just too out of the money just too far< far away and that's not what we exactly far away and that's not what we exactly want< want right sometimes you won't even get want right sometimes you won't even get enough< enough premium to justify selling that enough premium to justify selling that right< right so what we want to do is we want right so what we want to do is we want to< to sell it one at a time right how we do to sell it one at a time right how we do with< with that to sell one at time is with that to sell one at time is basically< basically whenever the price or the basically whenever the price or the stock< stock reaches close enough to that level stock reaches close enough to that level then< then we want to enter you know into the then we want to enter you know into the cash< cash secure put for the level so let's cash secure put for the level so let's say< say starting off we just go for level say starting off we just go for level one< one and let's say the market goes down one and let's say the market goes down now< now it has to go down below level one now it has to go down below level one then< then this is where we can start to then this is where we can start to consider< consider selling into level two so this consider selling into level two so this is< is where you go to the option chain and is where you go to the option chain and then< then you take a look at your weekly then you take a look at your weekly options< options you take a look at your weekly options you take a look at your weekly options< options and then you choose you know the options and then you choose you know the strike< strike that is uh coincides with level strike that is uh coincides with level two< two right then you sell it and then two right then you sell it and then that's< that's how you get your weekly income that's how you get your weekly income right< right the weekly premium and all you got right the weekly premium and all you got to< to do is just sell it once and leave it to do is just sell it once and leave it to< to expiration because for this strategy to expiration because for this strategy we< we are pretty much just going to either we are pretty much just going to either get< get assigned or if it expires we're get assigned or if it expires we're going< going to just keep selling again right going to just keep selling again right so< so once it gets to level two we sell the so once it gets to level two we sell the level< level two cash account put if it goes level two cash account put if it goes down< down to level three thereabouts again we down to level three thereabouts again we sell< sell another cash account put and let's sell another cash account put and let's say< say for example at the point of time say for example at the point of time level< level one and level two gets assigned level one and level two gets assigned then< then guess what this is where you can then guess what this is where you can start< start to consider selling the covered start to consider selling the covered call< call so again with the cover call we do call so again with the cover call we do want< want to sell it uh according to where want to sell it uh according to where the< the price is near to right near which the price is near to right near which level< level so if it's near level two we want level so if it's near level two we want to< to sell the cover call for level two to sell the cover call for level two first< first sell again a weekly option so this first sell again a weekly option so this way< way again at the end of the week you can way again at the end of the week you can realize< realize some sort of income through the realize some sort of income through the selling< selling of the premium and if the market selling of the premium and if the market goes< goes up to level one again you can sell goes up to level one again you can sell the< the cover call there again so basically the cover call there again so basically as< as you can see all you do down here is as you can see all you do down here is just< just repeatedly just selling it across just repeatedly just selling it across you< you know the multiple level so you you know the multiple level so you actually< actually do have something to do as the actually do have something to do as the market< market goes down rather than if you were market goes down rather than if you were to< to split across multiple stocks guess to split across multiple stocks guess what< what if the stocks goes all the way down what if the stocks goes all the way down then< then there's really nothing for you to then there's really nothing for you to do< do you're just staring at your chart all do you're just staring at your chart all day< day long without being able to do day long without being able to do anything< anything if you have run out of capital anything if you have run out of capital so< so just by having multiple levels to so just by having multiple levels to sell< sell the cash secure put you have sell the cash secure put you have already< already made the strategy safer than the already made the strategy safer than the traditional< traditional wheel strategy so that is traditional wheel strategy so that is why< why I say this is you know pretty safe why I say this is you know pretty safe right< right however while it's still safer right however while it's still safer than< than the traditional wheel strategy than the traditional wheel strategy if< if you choose the wrong stock right and if you choose the wrong stock right and it< it goes to zero then you're going to it goes to zero then you're going to still< still lose money right so this is the still lose money right so this is the very< very big impact that you know really very big impact that you know really determines< determines whether you're going to be determines whether you're going to be profitable< profitable with this strategy or not and profitable with this strategy or not and that< that is choosing the right stock right that is choosing the right stock right because< because if you choose the wrong stock no because if you choose the wrong stock no matter< matter how many levels that you have matter how many levels that you have even< even though you go all the way to $1 of even though you go all the way to $1 of the< the stock if it goes to zero you're just the stock if it goes to zero you're just going< going to lose everything right so that going to lose everything right so that is< is why it's also very important to is why it's also very important to choose< choose the right stock when you're doing choose the right stock when you're doing you< you know this income grid wheel strategy you know this income grid wheel strategy so< so how do you make the income grid wheel so how do you make the income grid wheel strategy< strategy even safer by the way if you strategy even safer by the way if you like< like this video so far Please Subscribe like this video so far Please Subscribe and< and also click the thumbs up

com blueprint all options with davis. com blueprint all right< right back to the video well the answer right back to the video well the answer is< is by selecting stocks that have the two is by selecting stocks that have the two following< following criteria right this is what I following criteria right this is what I look< look for when I'm doing the income GD look for when I'm doing the income GD real< real strategy number one you want to real strategy number one you want to look< look for strong fundamentals that means look for strong fundamentals that means we< we want to have fundamentally good stock we want to have fundamentally good stock and< and then we also want to have strong and then we also want to have strong technicals< technicals so this is what we want to technicals so this is what we want to look< look at on the chart and I'm going to look at on the chart and I'm going to get< get into each of them right now right so get into each of them right now right so the< the first one is strong fundamentals now the first one is strong fundamentals now there< there are many many ways for you to there are many many ways for you to determine< determine what's a strong fundamental determine what's a strong fundamental and< and there's actually many criterias as and there's actually many criterias as well< well well I'm not going to go into all well well I'm not going to go into all of< of them right because this is mainly uh of them right because this is mainly uh about< about trading so the most important about trading so the most important thing< thing that I actually look out for is thing that I actually look out for is increasing< increasing year- on-year revenue and increasing year- on-year revenue and profit< profit so what really determines whether profit so what really determines whether the< the underlying stock is have a have at the underlying stock is have a have at least< least a greater chance for it to go up least a greater chance for it to go up in< in the long term rather than it go down in the long term rather than it go down to< to zero so you need to understand that to zero so you need to understand that each< each stock is actually a company right each stock is actually a company right this< this company is trying to make money this company is trying to make money right< right they're selling product products right they're selling product products or< or services and what they want to do is or services and what they want to do is they< they want to make money and generally they want to make money and generally investors< investors want to invest in stocks that investors want to invest in stocks that they< they know that over the long term can they know that over the long term can make< make money for them so if you're make money for them so if you're invested< invested into a stock or you choose a invested into a stock or you choose a stock< stock that's actually not making money stock that's actually not making money then< then it's going to actually reflect in then it's going to actually reflect in the< the share price as well because there's the share price as well because there's not< not going to be that much confidence not going to be that much confidence compared< compared to a company that has actually compared to a company that has actually profits< profits right increasing revenue and profits right increasing revenue and increasing< increasing profits so when you take a increasing profits so when you take a look< look at these two company income look at these two company income statement< statement down here right you have the statement down here right you have the first< first company above and the one below first company above and the one below right< right so as you can see down here the right so as you can see down here the company< company a you can see that the revenue company a you can see that the revenue in< in blue is very inconsistent right you in blue is very inconsistent right you can< can see it it's up then it goes down can see it it's up then it goes down goes< goes slightly up goes down again and the goes slightly up goes

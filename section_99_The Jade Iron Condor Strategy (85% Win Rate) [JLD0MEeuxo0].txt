==============================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we< we are going to be talking about a we are going to be talking about a pretty< pretty special iron Condor and this is pretty special iron Condor and this is what< what I call the Jade iron Condor now if what I call the Jade iron Condor now if you< you are thinking you know if it's what you are thinking you know if it's what is< is this Jade iron Condor is this some is this Jade iron Condor is this some sort< sort of expensifying condor that you sort of expensifying condor that you have< have to call it Jade or is this taken have to call it Jade or is this taken right< right out of the Tang Dynasty or right out of the Tang Dynasty or something< something like that well if you have something like that well if you have seen< seen my previous video where I talked seen my previous video where I talked about< about the Jade lizard well then you will about the Jade lizard well then you will know< know that this Jade iron Condor has some know that this Jade iron Condor has some sort< sort of a relation to the Jade lizard sort of a relation to the Jade lizard right< right because you have the name Jade and right because you have the name Jade and basically< basically the Jade lizard if you haven't basically the Jade lizard if you haven't seen< seen the video by the way I'll put the seen the video by the way I'll put the link< link at the top right hand corner of link at the top right hand corner of this< this video but basically that is a this video but basically that is a strategy< strategy that has no risk to the upside strategy that has no risk to the upside so< so it is a shot put on the put side and so it is a shot put on the put side and then< then there is the bare call spread on then there is the bare call spread on the< the other side so when you combine both the other side so when you combine both together< together you have what you call the Jade together you have what you call the Jade lizard< lizard and you structure it in a way lizard and you structure it in a way where< where there is no risk to the upside now where there is no risk to the upside now the< the Jade Condor is basically just the the Jade Condor is basically just the defined< defined risk version of the Jade lizard defined risk version of the Jade lizard right< right so the Jade lizard is actually a right so the Jade lizard is actually a shot< shot put where you have just a shot put shot put where you have just a shot put down< down here so I'll put the shot put over down here so I'll put the shot put over here< here to let you know this is the shot here to let you know this is the shot put< put strike and then you have the bare put strike and then you have the bare call< call spread on this side right so I'll call spread on this side right so I'll put< put BCS so as you can see the back hole put BCS so as you can see the back hole spread< spread is this side now for the Jade spread is this side now for the Jade iron< iron Condor It's actually an iron Condor iron Condor It's actually an iron Condor structure< structure because this is actually also structure because this is actually also a< a put spread so you can see down here a put spread so you can see down here all< all right maybe you can't really see all right maybe you can't really see down< down here I'll just put an arrow over down here I'll just put an arrow over here< here this is where your long put is here this is where your long put is right< right so basically what it is right so basically what it is is< is a put spread on the left hand side is a put spread on the left hand side this< this is where you get your put spread this is where you get your put spread right< right your bull put spread and then on right your bull put spread and then on the< the right hand side you have your bear the right hand side you have your bear call< call spread so this is basically the call spread so this is basically the same< same structure as an iron Condor now the same structure as an iron Condor now the only< only difference you will notice is that only difference you will notice is that on< on the right hand side this bare call on the right hand side this bare call spread< spread over here you notice that the spread over here you notice that the spread< spread is actually pretty small right spread is actually pretty small right it's< it's very tight right it's much narrower it's very tight right it's much narrower than< than this uh put spread on the left hand than this uh put spread on the left hand side< side and the reason we want to structure side and the reason we want to structure it< it in this way is so that there is no it in this way is so that there is no wrist< wrist to the upside okay so basically wrist to the upside okay so basically the< the Jade iron Condor is a way for you to the Jade iron Condor is a way for you to put< put on the iron Condor so that you know put on the iron Condor so that you know you< you do not get hit on the upside so the you do not get hit on the upside so the market< market if you notice this is where the market if you notice this is where the current< current market price is all right this current market price is all right this is< is the current market price and if the is the current market price and if the market< market was to go all the way up to the market was to go all the way up to the Moon< Moon all right on the right hand side is Moon all right on the right hand side is where< where the prices increase if it goes where the prices increase if it goes past< past your shots right you actually don't past your shots right you actually don't really< really have to worry because there is no really have to worry because there is no risk< risk to the upside right it can go all risk to the upside right it can go all the< the way to the moon and you still do not the way to the moon and you still do not lose< lose money on this trade because if you lose money on this trade because if you can< can see it down here can see it down here right< right this Ridge graph down here you can right this Ridge graph down here you can see< see that it is above the zero line now see that it is above the zero line. now one< one thing to take note is that although one thing to take note is that although there< there is no risk to the upside that there is no risk to the upside that means< means you do not actually lose money if means you do not actually lose money if the< the market blows past your backhaul the market blows past your backhaul spread< spread on the upside you still have to spread on the upside you still have to bear< bear in mind that this strikes are bear in mind that this strikes are actually< actually still in the money that means actually still in the money that means you< you have a short call strike down here you have a short call strike down here this< this is the short call strike this is the short call strike you< you have this short call down here you have this short call down here basically< basically it will now be in the money so basically it will now be in the money so that< that is why although there's no risk to that is why although there's no risk to the< the upside we still do not want to hold the upside we still do not want to hold this< this all the way to expiration now of this all the way to expiration now of course< course there's the argument that you course there's the argument that you know< know if the price stays within this uh know if the price stays within this uh two< two short strikes right then you can two short strikes right then you can still< still hold on to expiration there are still hold on to expiration there are people< people who say that you know even in an people who say that you know even in an iron< iron Condor if it doesn't breaches the iron Condor if it doesn't breaches the short< short stride they want to hold the short stride they want to hold the expiration< expiration yep that's fine if you want expiration yep that's fine if you want to< to as well but if this goes past your to as well but if this goes past your short< short strike down here short strike down here and< and there's you know not many days left and there's you know not many days left to< to expiration this is where you could to expiration this is where you could get< get an early assignment so if you're an get an early assignment so if you're an early< early assigned on a short call what will early assigned on a short call what will happen< happen is that you will become short a happen is that you will become short a hundred< hundred shares per contract there right hundred shares per contract there right so< so this is where you want to really take so this is where you want to really take note< note of this right so as much as note of this right so as much as possible< possible we want to close out before the possible we want to close out before the expiration< expiration of this whole trade down here expiration of this whole trade down here by< by the way one more thing I want to by the way one more thing I want to mention< mention is you know is Jade iron Condor mention is you know is Jade iron Condor actually< actually a real name no it's not right actually a real name no it's not right it's< it's not something that people has it's not something that people has adopted< adopted in fact I think I'm the only one adopted in fact I think I'm the only one that< that I've adopted this as Jade iron that I've adopted this as Jade iron Condor< Condor and the only reason is because Condor and the only reason is because there< there is a strategy called the Jade there is a strategy called the Jade lizard< lizard right the Jade lizard is coined lizard right the Jade lizard is coined by< by the folks at tastytrade so basically by the folks at tastytrade so basically the< the Jade iron Condor right I just took the Jade iron Condor right I just took after< after the name Jade lizard so that you after the name Jade lizard so that you know< know we all know when you put on the know we all know when you put on the iron< iron Condor there's no risk to the iron Condor there's no risk to the upside< upside otherwise this will actually just upside otherwise this will actually just be< be called a skilled iron Condor right a be called a skilled iron Condor right a skilled< skilled iron Condor is basically whereby skilled iron Condor is basically whereby the< the wings are uneven right on one side the wings are uneven right on one side you< you maybe have 10 points wide the other you maybe have 10 points wide the other side< side maybe you have five points wide side maybe you have five points wide this< this is what you call a skilled iron this is what you call a skilled iron condo< condo where the wings are not even so condo where the wings are not even so when< when I use the term Jade iron Condor it when I use the term Jade iron Condor it just< just means that it's an iron Condor with just means that it's an iron Condor with no< no wrist to the upside so maybe in no wrist to the upside so maybe in future< future videos if I just say the jet iron future videos if I just say the jet iron Condor< Condor then you will know oh okay Davis Condor then you will know oh okay Davis is< is putting on an Iron Condor that has no is putting on an Iron Condor that has no wrist< wrist to the upside so for our purposes wrist to the upside so for our purposes only< only and

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video okay so the Jade iron back to the video okay so the Jade iron condor< condor one thing you need to take note condor one thing you need to take note of< of is that the blue put spread has a of is that the blue put spread has a wider< wider width in the back hole spread all wider width in the back hole spread all the< the time right on the left hand side you the time right on the left hand side you notice< notice that the width is much bigger notice that the width is much bigger down< down here right let me just draw the down here right let me just draw the arrow< arrow down here so the width is much arrow down here so the width is much wider< wider compared to this where you can see wider compared to this where you can see this< this is very narrow okay and in terms of this is very narrow okay and in terms of the< the Delta generally on the put side the Delta generally on the put side right< right we want somewhere around 15 to 25 right we want somewhere around 15 to 25 deltas< deltas and then on the call spread side deltas and then on the call spread side this< this is where you're going to have this is where you're going to have anywhere< anywhere. from 25 to 35 Delta so the anywhere from 25 to 35 Delta so the thing< thing is that you really want to go to thing is that you really want to go to the< the option chain to really play around the option chain to really play around with< with the strikes because you really need with the strikes because you really need to< to get the strikes right in order to to get the strikes right in order to make< make sure that there is no risk to the make sure that there is no risk to the upside< upside okay if if you're gonna have a upside okay if if you're gonna have a width< width that is too big then there could width that is too big then there could be< be some risk to the upside so this is be some risk to the upside so this is where< where you really need to know how to where you really need to know how to change< change the strike so the other thing I change the strike so the other thing I wanted< wanted to point out which I forgot to wanted to point out which I forgot to point< point out in the first slide right is point out in the first slide right is this< this thing down here you'll notice that this thing down here you'll notice that this< this iron Condor has a win rate of 85.

21 this iron Condor has a win rate of 85. 21 now< now this is a pretty high win rate for now this is a pretty high win rate for an< an iron Condor because it iron Condor an iron Condor because it iron Condor right< right typically the win rate will be right typically the win rate will be somewhere< somewhere around 65 right 60 70 if you somewhere around 65 right 60 70 if you go< go for the very low Delta short strikes go for the very low Delta short strikes right< right but otherwise generally it will be right but otherwise generally it will be around< around 65 or so right maybe even 60 but around 65 or so right maybe even 60 but for< for this you notice you have a very high for this you notice you have a very high win< win rate and the only reason is because win rate and the only reason is because on< on the right hand side anywhere that it on the right hand side anywhere that it goes< goes past down here from where the goes past down here from where the macaron< macaron market price is is all a profit macaron market price is is all a profit right< right so that is why there is this very right so that is why there is this very wide wide wide um win< um win rate now the trade-off of course um win rate now the trade-off of course is< is that you will get a lower premium is that you will get a lower premium compared< compared to the normal iron Condor so compared to the normal iron Condor so why< why is this so well you can see on the why is this so well you can see on the chart< chart down here or rather this p l graph chart down here or rather this p l graph is< is pretty obvious right because on the is pretty obvious right because on the left< left hand side you get the premium for a left hand side you get the premium for a very< very wide spread right let's say for very wide spread right let's say for example< example this is a 10 wide spread right example this is a 10 wide spread right so< so your premium will definitely be so your premium will definitely be higher< higher but whereas on the right hand higher but whereas on the right hand side< side this could be maybe a dollar or side this could be maybe a dollar or maybe< maybe even two dollar wide spread so if maybe even two dollar wide spread so if this< this is a two dollar wide spread then this is a two dollar wide spread then you're< you're not going to get that much credit you're not going to get that much credit so< so most of the time you will notice that so most of the time you will notice that the< the credit which you get on the put side the credit which you get on the put side is< is much more than the credit you get on is much more than the credit you get on the< the call side right so when you combine the call side right so when you combine this< this together you get a premium that is this together you get a premium that is most< most definitely lower than the normal most definitely lower than the normal iron< iron condo which you put on because both iron condo which you put on because both sides< sides would generally be of the same sides would generally be of the same width< width all right now how do you decide width all right now how do you decide the< the width of the bear call spread so the width of the bear call spread so this< this width down here how do you know how this width down here how do you know how much< much or rather how wide the width should much or rather how wide the width should be< be right so the way you want to be right so the way you want to structure< structure this is based on what is the structure this is based on what is the total< total credit that you can get right so total credit that you can get right so the< the general rule of thumb is if you want the general rule of thumb is if you want no< no wrist to the upside the total credit no wrist to the upside the total credit which< which you receive has to be more than or which you receive has to be more than or equal< equal to the width of the bear call equal to the width of the bear call spread< spread alright so here's an example so spread alright so here's an example so let's< let's say for example on the put site let's say for example on the put site let's< let's say for example you get maybe a let's say for example you get maybe a dollar< dollar in terms of your premium all dollar in terms of your premium all right< right so for the put spread you get a right so for the put spread you get a dollar< dollar premium but on the call side dollar premium but on the call side maybe< maybe let's say you get only 35 cents maybe let's say you get only 35 cents okay< okay so what is the total premium down okay so what is the total premium down here< here so the total premium if you add here so the total premium if you add these< these two together it becomes a dollar these two together it becomes a dollar and< and 35 cents that means this is the and 35 cents that means this is the total< total payment which will receive for total payment which will receive for combining< combining these two spreads together so combining these two spreads together so based< based on this how do you know one is the based on this how do you know one is the spread< spread you should have so the spread spread you should have so the spread should< should be smaller than this premium should be smaller than this premium which< which you receive which means to say if which you receive which means to say if this< this is a dollar thirty five that means this is a dollar thirty five that means the< the spread down here it needs to be a the spread down here it needs to be a dollar< dollar wide why why because the loss dollar wide why why because the loss that< that you make on the call side is that you make on the call side is essentially< essentially just the spread width right essentially just the spread width right so< so if it's a one dollar wise width if so if it's a one dollar wise width if the< the market blows through this call the market blows through this call spread< spread on the right hand side spread on the right hand side basically< basically you'll be losing a dollar for basically you'll be losing a dollar for the< the spread right so per contract it will the spread right so per contract it will be< be a hundred dollars okay so if you have be a hundred dollars okay so if you have a< a dollar and 35 cents and then you have a dollar and 35 cents and then you have a< a dollar loss on the right hand side the a dollar loss on the right hand side the width< width if the market goes past this call width if the market goes past this call spread< spread which means to say the net right spread which means to say the net right let's< let's just put down here the net becomes let's just put down here the net becomes a< a positive 35 cents right which means to a positive 35 cents right which means to say< say if the market goes past this bad say if the market goes past this bad call< call spread all the strikes on the right call spread all the strikes on the right hand< hand side right it goes past down here hand side right it goes past down here the< the maximum that you can make is 35 the maximum that you can make is 35 cents< cents which is 35 per contract that you cents which is 35 per contract that you put< put on right so as you can see there is put on right so as you can see there is no< no risk to the upside now what happens no risk to the upside now what happens if< if you put let's say a two dollar if you put let's say a two dollar widespread< widespread so let's say if you put a two widespread so let's say if you put a two dollar< dollar wide spread so now suddenly dollar wide spread so now suddenly there< there will be risk to the upside right there will be risk to the upside right so< so now let's cancel this 35 cents so a so now let's cancel this 35 cents so a dollar< dollar 35 cents you minus off your two dollar 35 cents you minus off your two dollar< dollar loss so this will give you a 65 dollar loss so this will give you a 65 cents< cents loss right so it's 65 cents lost cents loss right so it's 65 cents lost to< to the up size which is actually not too to the up size which is actually not too bad< bad as well because on the left hand bad as well because on the left hand side< side you'll be roughly taking you know side you'll be roughly taking you know about< about close to 800 to 900 risk right but about close to 800 to 900 risk right but on< on the right hand side you're only on the right hand side you're only taking< taking about 65 risk so if you widen out taking about 65 risk so if you widen out the< the spread on the right hand side you the spread on the right hand side you could< could at least get more credit because could at least get more credit because the< the wider the width you get more credit the wider the width you get more credit and< and it contributes to your overall and it contributes to your overall premium< premium right but then you may have to premium right but then you may have to take< take some risk to the upside right so take some risk to the upside right so this< this is a trade-off so generally if you this is a trade-off so generally if you do< do not want any risk to the upside you do not want any risk to the upside you just< just want to ensure that this premium just want to ensure that this premium down< down here down here is< is much more than the spread that you is much more than the spread that you create< create down here all right so that's create down here all right so that's quite< quite a bit of a drawings down here let quite a bit of a drawings down here let me< me just remove all of them to make it me just remove all of them to make it clearer< clearer again okay so let's give an clearer again okay so let's give an another< another example so let's say for example another example so let's say for example down< down here the put spread down here let's down here the put spread down here let's say< say you get a dollar and 50 cents right say you get a dollar and 50 cents right let's< let's say if you get a dollar fifty let's say if you get a dollar fifty cents< cents for the put spread down here and cents for the put spread down here and on< on the right hand side let's say you are on the right hand side let's say you are able< able to get say 60 cents now if you able to get say 60 cents now if you combine< combine these two together by the way combine these two together by the way when< when you put on this spread let's say when you put on this spread let's say you< you put on a two dollar widespread let's you put on a two dollar widespread let's say< say you put on a two dollar wide spread say you put on a two dollar wide spread you< you get a 60 cents credit on the right you get a 60 cents credit on the right hand< hand side so this in total will give you hand side so this in total will give you two< two dollars and ten cents which means to two dollars and ten cents which means to say< say there's no risk to the upside again say there's no risk to the upside again two< two dollar ten cents covers the width of two dollar ten cents covers the width of your< your bear call spread now let's say you your bear call spread now let's say you want< want to try and push the envelope a want to try and push the envelope a little< little. bit and now you go to three little bit and now you go to three dollars< dollars wide now with three dollars why dollars wide now with three dollars why you< you notice that this premium will also you notice that this premium will also increase< increase as well right so maybe this increase as well right so maybe this will< will now become let's say a dollar let's will now become let's say a dollar let's say< say you get a dollar you increase the say you get a dollar you increase the three< three dollars so now your total premium three dollars so now your total premium is< is two dollars fifty cents so now from is two dollars fifty cents so now from here< here you have a decision to make right here you have a decision to make right because< because immediately from this total because immediately from this total premium< premium if you're minus off this with premium if you're minus off this with down< down here you're gonna get a risk of 50 down here you're gonna get a risk of 50 cents< cents to the upside right fifty dollars cents to the upside right fifty dollars so so so down< down here you have two options that you down here you have two options that you have< have you have to make a decision is have you have to make a decision is whether< whether you want to take on this small whether you want to take on this small little< little risk so you get more premium little risk so you get more premium overall< overall for this whole trade or you want overall for this whole trade or you want to< to have no risk to the upside and then to have no risk to the upside and then you< you want to go for the two dollar white you want to go for the two dollar white instead< instead so if you go for the two dollar instead so if you go for the two dollar wide< wide so now your premium will just drop wide so now your premium will just drop by< by a bit right it will just drop to the by a bit right it will just drop to the previous< previous one okay so there's no right or previous one okay so there's no right or wrong< wrong it all comes down to what you're wrong it all comes down to what you're comfortable< comfortable with okay so I've already comfortable with okay so I've already covered< covered this right so here's another covered this right so here's another important< important thing that you want to take important thing that you want to take note< note of when you are creating the Jade note of when you are creating the Jade iron< iron Condor is that ideally we want the iron Condor is that ideally we want the call< call spread premium on the right hand call spread premium on the right hand side< side down here to be at least 25 to 30 side down here to be at least 25 to 30 percent< percent of this total premium down here percent of this total premium down here all< all right this total premium over here all right this total premium over here and< and the reason is because if you're and the reason is because if you're going< going to build your jet iron Condor and going to build your jet iron Condor and your< your bad call spread on the right hand your bad call spread on the right hand side< side if it's only like five percent of side if it's only like five percent of the< the total premium then it defeats the the total premium then it defeats the whole< whole purpose of you putting on this a whole purpose of you putting on this a bear< bear call spread in the first place bear call spread in the first place right< right because if the market really goes right because if the market really goes up< up if the market really goes all the way up if the market really goes all the way up< up then this put spread is going to be up then this put spread is going to be making< making a lot of money but then you're making a lot of money but then you're going< going to cancel off your profits right going to cancel off your profits right from< from here because of your bad cost from here because of your bad cost spread< spread on the right hand side and for spread on the right hand side and for what< what for only five percent of the what for only five percent of the premium< premium you remove all the profits that premium you remove all the profits that you< you have taken you could have taken from you have taken you could have taken from the< the put spread so that is why we want to the put spread so that is why we want to have< have a at least a 25 to 30 percent of have a at least a 25 to 30 percent of this< this total premium so for example if the this total premium so for example if the total< total premium all right let me just total premium all right let me just remove< remove this remove this so< so let's say for example the total so let's say for example the total premium< premium that you receive for this spread premium that you receive for this spread is< is two dollars so which means to say of is two dollars so which means to say of this< this two dollars the call spread side this two dollars the call spread side you< you want it to be at about 50 cents to you want it to be at about 50 cents to 60< 60 cents right so this way it will then 60 cents right so this way it will then be< be about 25 to 30 percent at the same be about 25 to 30 percent at the same time< time because if you have more premium time because if you have more premium down< down here if the market actually goes down here if the market actually goes down< down then you have some sort of a down then you have some sort of a cushion< cushion as well right this put spread cushion as well right this put spread will< will not take the full heat because you will not take the full heat because you got< got quite you know quite a bit of a got quite you know quite a bit of a premium< premium that you receive for selling the premium that you receive for selling the back< back or spread so in a sense it's back or spread so in a sense it's hedging< hedging each other okay so let us take a hedging each other okay so let us take a look< look at how it looks like on the chart look at how it looks like on the chart right< right so if you take a look on the chart right so if you take a look on the chart it< it will look something like this so for it will look something like this so for this< this example I've used it on the iwm I this example I've used it on the iwm I use< use this on a 15 wide spread so this is use this on a 15 wide spread so this is 15< 15 wide and you can see on the call side 15 wide and you can see on the call side this< this is two dollars now where is the this is two dollars now where is the profit< profit zone so generally for a normal profit zone so generally for a normal iron< iron Condor The Profit Zone would iron Condor The Profit Zone would actually< actually be from this line to this line actually be from this line to this line all< all right generally over this line not all right generally over this line not including< including the break even if you include including the break even if you include the< the break even you'll be somewhere the break even you'll be somewhere around< around here past the short strikes for a around here past the short strikes for a normal< normal iron Condor okay this is normal iron Condor okay this is generally< generally because anything that goes generally because anything that goes past< past your break even on both sides the past your break even on both sides the iron< iron Condor will actually start to lose iron Condor will actually start to lose money< money okay but for the Jade

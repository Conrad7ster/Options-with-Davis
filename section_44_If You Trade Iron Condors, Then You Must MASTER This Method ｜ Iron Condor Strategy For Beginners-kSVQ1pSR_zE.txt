Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we< we are going to be talking about the we are going to be talking about the iron< iron Condor assignment reversal strategy iron Condor assignment reversal strategy so< so getting a sign is one of the scariest so getting a sign is one of the scariest things< things that many people face right things that many people face right they're< they're afraid of getting assigned and they're afraid of getting assigned and what's< what's more scary is that if you get a what's more scary is that if you get a margin< margin call right so a lot of people margin call right so a lot of people when< when they trade the iron Condor and all when they trade the iron Condor and all of< of a sudden they get assigned they have of a sudden they get assigned they have no< no idea what to do and they they really no idea what to do and they they really Panic< Panic so if this is you you know you Panic so if this is you you know you have< have no idea how to unwind an assignment have no idea how to unwind an assignment then< then do not worry have no fear because I then do not worry have no fear because I got< got you covered in this video I'm gonna got you covered in this video I'm gonna share< share with you a very simple way to share with you a very simple way to unwind< unwind any iron Condor assignment that unwind any iron Condor assignment that you< you have all right so let's Dive Right you have all right so let's Dive Right In< In so first of all when are you most In so first of all when are you most likely< likely to get assigned on your iron likely to get assigned on your iron Condor< Condor well the answer is that when Condor well the answer is that when either< either of your short legs goes in the either of your short legs goes in the money< money right so one of the things that money right so one of the things that you< you need to understand is that you can you need to understand is that you can only< only get a sign on either the put side only get a sign on either the put side or< or the call side right there's no way or the call side right there's no way for< for you to get assigned at both places for you to get assigned at both places at< at one time right because the market can at one time right because the market can only< only be at one place at any given time only be at one place at any given time so< so it's either you get assigned on your so it's either you get assigned on your short< short call on your iron Condor or on the short call on your iron Condor or on the shot< shot put right so the time when you have shot put right so the time when you have the< the highest risk of getting assigned is the highest risk of getting assigned is when< when the extrinsic value of the short when the extrinsic value of the short lake< lake is very little right and that's lake is very little right and that's usually< usually when there's not many DTE left usually when there's not many DTE left and< and when your short lake is deep in the and when your short lake is deep in the money< money right so when your short leg is money right so when your short leg is really< really deep in money right let's say for really deep in money right let's say for example< example for the call side basically the example for the call side basically the market< market has just blown through your call market has just blown through your call spread< spread or on the put side the market has spread or on the put side the market has gone< gone way past your put spread so this is gone way past your put spread so this is time< time where your shot put strike and your time where your shot put strike and your short< short call strike is going to be very short call strike is going to be very deep< deep in the money right so deep in the deep in the money right so deep in the money< money this is when you know you're gonna money this is when you know you're gonna have< have very little extrinsic value and a have very little extrinsic value and a lot< lot of intrinsic value so another thing lot of intrinsic value so another thing that< that you want to take note is that for that you want to take note is that for the< the call spread and the put spread side the call spread and the put spread side there's< there's a slight difference right the there's a slight difference right the slight< slight difference is that for the bare slight difference is that for the bare call< call spread side which is this call call spread side which is this call spread< spread up here basically for the call spread up here basically for the call spread< spread you have an additional risk which spread you have an additional risk which is< is what we call the dividend risk right is what we call the dividend risk right dividend< dividend risk is basically when the dividend risk is basically when the underlying< underlying that your trading bid an underlying that your trading bid an individual< individual stock or an index ETF is individual stock or an index ETF is going< going to pay out a dividend so this is a going to pay out a dividend so this is a time< time where you want to take a look at time where you want to take a look at the< the dividend paid as well so the time the dividend paid as well so the time when< when you're going to have the highest when you're going to have the highest risk< risk of actually getting a sign on your risk of actually getting a sign on your short< short call stride is when the extrinsic short call stride is when the extrinsic value< value all right let me just write it value all right let me just write it down< down here your extrinsic value is lesser down here your extrinsic value is lesser than< than the dividend that is going to be than the dividend that is going to be paid< paid up right so let's say for example paid up right so let's say for example if< if your extrinsic value left on this uh if your extrinsic value left on this uh short< short call let's say it's about 30 cents short call let's say it's about 30 cents okay< okay so let's say it's 30 cents this is okay so let's say it's 30 cents this is a< a dollar sign by the way on the left a dollar sign by the way on the left hand< hand side is less than the dividend hand side is less than the dividend maybe< maybe the dividend is paying out 50 maybe the dividend is paying out 50 cents< cents right so during this time you cents right so during this time you could< could have some dividend risk because could have some dividend risk because the< the buyer of this call option right now the buyer of this call option right now remember< remember now you are short the call remember now you are short the call option< option so on the opposite side of the option so on the opposite side of the trade< trade is the person will be buying this trade is the person will be buying this call< call option so the call buyer has the call option so the call buyer has the option< option to actually exercise his call option to actually exercise his call option< option and when he exercises his call option and when he exercises his call option< option he's basically going to be long option he's basically going to be long 100< 100 shares so if this call option buyer 100 shares so if this call option buyer he< he was to sell off his just calls and he was to sell off his just calls and just< just sell it off without actually just sell it off without actually exercising< exercising he would only get 30 cents exercising he would only get 30 cents but< but if he was to exercise it and then but if he was to exercise it and then actually< actually get the dividend when the actually get the dividend when the dividend< dividend gets paid out he's going to get dividend gets paid out he's going to get 50< 50 cents so there's more incentive for 50 cents so there's more incentive for him< him to exercise so this is very him to exercise so this is very important< important for you to really take note of important for you to really take note of if< if you have any short call option that if you have any short call option that is< is in the money and the underlying is in the money and the underlying actually< actually pays a dividend now on the blue actually pays a dividend now on the blue put< put spread side which is basically just put spread side which is basically just the< the put spread there is no dividend risk the put spread there is no dividend risk right< right there's no different risk so you right there's no different risk so you do< do not have to worry about it at all so do not have to worry about it at all so even< even though if the market you know goes even though if the market you know goes way< way below your put strike you don't have way below your put strike you don't have to< to worry about the dividend right it to worry about the dividend right it does< does not affect it at all and the reason does not affect it at all and the reason why< why it doesn't affect it at all is why it doesn't affect it at all is because< because on the the opposite side the because on the the opposite side the person< person is actually holding on to a long person is actually holding on to a long put< put so with a long put option if you put so with a long put option if you exercise< exercise it he will actually be selling exercise it he will actually be selling 100< 100 shares so if he's selling 100 shares 100 shares so if he's selling 100 shares he< he does not get any dividend the only he does not get any dividend the only time< time you will get a dividend is if that time you will get a dividend is if that person< person actually owns the shares all person actually owns the shares all right< right so that is why there's no dealing right so that is why there's no dealing risk< risk for the put spread site risk for the put spread site okay< okay so let's talk about the put spread okay so let's talk about the put spread side< side first so what happens when you're side first so what happens when you're assigned< assigned on your shot put leg so assigned on your shot put leg so basically< basically when you assign on your shot basically when you assign on. your shot put< put Lake you will now belong a hundred put Lake you will now belong a hundred shares< shares at the strike price right so shares at the strike price right so let's< let's say for example the strike price let's say for example the strike price is< is a hundred dollars so what this means is a hundred dollars so what this means is< is now you'll be long a hundred shares is now you'll be long a hundred shares at< at a hundred dollars so the total at a hundred dollars so the total Capital< Capital you have to put up for this will Capital you have to put up for this will be< be ten thousand dollars right so if you be ten thousand dollars right so if you do< do not have ten thousand dollars then do not have ten thousand dollars then this< this is where you could get a margin this is where you could get a margin call< call right so ten thousand dollars most call right so ten thousand dollars most Brokers< Brokers would want you to put up 50 of Brokers would want you to put up 50 of it< it right so if you're on a margin it right so if you're on a margin account< account by the way if it's a margin account by the way if it's a margin account< account you have fifty percent margin by account you have fifty percent margin by default< default so you only have to put up five default so you only have to put up five thousand< thousand dollars for that and if you do thousand dollars for that and if you do not< not have this five thousand dollars in not have this five thousand dollars in your< your account then you're most likely your account then you're most likely going< going to get a margin call so at this going to get a margin call so at this point< point what do you do all right so some point what do you do all right so some people< people have mentioned that all you have people have mentioned that all you have to< to do to unwind this all you have to do to do to unwind this all you have to do is< is to just exercise this long put option is to just exercise this long put option because< because if you exercise this long put because if you exercise this long put option< option what's going to happen is that option what's going to happen is that it's< it's going to sell with this 100 shares it's going to sell with this 100 shares that< that you have so this way you have no that you have so this way you have no more< more positions on the on the bottom side more positions on the on the bottom side right< right but the problem with this is that right but the problem with this is that you're< you're actually going to realize the you're actually going to realize the maximum< maximum loss of this spread down here maximum loss of this spread down here because< because don't forget when you are because don't forget when you are exercising< exercising this put option what you're exercising this put option what you're doing< doing is that you're telling the broker doing is that you're telling the broker that< that you want to sell 100 shares at this that you want to sell 100 shares at this strike< strike price down here so if you bought strike price down here so if you bought 100< 100 shares at this strike price let's 100 shares at this strike price let's say< say for example this is a hundred say for example this is a hundred dollars< dollars the strike price and then let's dollars the strike price and then let's say< say down here is 90 so what's going to say down here is 90 so what's going to happen< happen is that you are going to buy a happen is that you are going to buy a hundred< hundred dollars and you sell at 90 and hundred dollars and you sell at 90 and you< you have just realized the full loss you have just realized the full loss down< down here just to clear out your shares down here just to clear out your shares now< now this is not an optimal way to do now this is not an optimal way to do this< this because if you were to just close this because if you were to just close out< out this position by itself that means out this position by itself that means you< you were to solve the 100 shares and you were to solve the 100 shares and then< then you were to sell this put option then you were to sell this put option you're< you're actually going to lose lesser the you're actually going to lose lesser the reason< reason you're going to lose lesser is reason you're going to lose lesser is because< because this put option at the bottom because this put option at the bottom down< down here this long put option still down here this long put option still have< have some extrinsic value and when have some extrinsic value and when there's< there's extrinsic value left it's going there's extrinsic value left it's going to< to help you actually cushion the loss of to help you actually cushion the loss of what< what you're making on this 100 shares so what you're making on this 100 shares so you're< you're actually better off if you just you're actually better off if you just close< close out this position rather than close out this position rather than exercising< exercising the put option right but this exercising the put option right but this is< is still not the best way to do things is still not the best way to do things right< right because if you were to do it this right because if you were to do it this way< way what happened is that now you're way what happened is that now you're suddenly< suddenly no longer having an iron Condor suddenly no longer having an iron Condor right< right all you have is just a call spread right all you have is just a call spread on< on and if the market suddenly shoots on and if the market suddenly shoots back< back up now your call spread is going to back up now your call spread is going to be< be in a risk so what should you do be in a risk so what should you do instead< instead so here is three very simple instead so here is three very simple steps< steps to unwind your assignment right so steps to unwind your assignment right so the< the very first thing you want to do is the very first thing you want to do is to< to just sell off this 100 shares once to just sell off this 100 shares once you< you sold off this 100 shares you're not you sold off this 100 shares you're not going< going to have any positions so it's just going to have any positions so it's just going< going to leave you with this long put going to leave you with this long put option< option at the bottom after that all you option at the bottom after that all you have< have to do is sell the original shot put have to do is sell the original shot put strike< strike so again if this shot put strike strike so again if this shot put strike is< is at a hundred dollars is at a hundred dollars when< when you sell the shot put strike you're when you sell the shot put strike you're going< going to sell the same place as well going to sell the same place as well right< right and you're going to sell the same right and you're going to sell the same DTE< DTE as well so let's say for example DTE as well so let's say for example maybe< maybe this has 10 DTE so you're going to maybe this has 10 DTE so you're going to sell< sell the 10 DTE as well and the reason sell the 10 DTE as well and the reason we< we want to do this is we want to do this we want to do this is we want to do this step< step by step right because if you plan step by step right because if you plan to< to actually roll it and you roll it to to actually roll it and you roll it to maybe< maybe the 30 dtes then what's going to maybe the 30 dtes then what's going to happen< happen is that your shot put strike is happen is that your shot put strike is going< going to be 30 DTE and now you're going going to be 30 DTE and now you're going to< to have a long put below that's 10 DTE to have a long put below that's 10 DTE and< and the call spread is going to be 10 DT and the call spread is going to be 10 DT as< as well it's going to be very confusing as well it's going to be very confusing so< so we want to do this step by step very so we want to do this step by step very mechanical< mechanical approach so step three mechanical approach so step three actually< actually is just step one and two done actually is just step one and two done together< together so if you think about it it's together so if you think about it it's really< really just one step so what it means is really just one step so what it means is that< that if you get assigned what you want that if you get assigned what you want to< to do is try and do it in a single order to do is try and do it in a single order ticket< ticket if you can right most Brokers ticket if you can right most Brokers have< have this functionality so you can see have this functionality so you can see down< down here you can sell off this put down here you can sell off this put option< option and then sell the 100 shares at option and then sell the 100 shares at the< the same time and then you'll get back the same time and then you'll get back your< your credit and what's going to happen your credit and what's going to happen it's< it's going to also relieve your Margin it's going to also relieve your Margin Call< Call so what do you do after unwinding Call so what do you do after unwinding your< your assignment by the way if you like your assignment by the way if you like this< this video do so far Please Subscribe this video do so far Please Subscribe and< and also click the

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video you're not out of the back to the video you're not out of the woods< woods yet because remember this shot put woods yet because remember this shot put down< down here is back to the original DTE so down here is back to the original DTE so let's< let's say for example it was 10 DTE let's say for example it was 10 DTE which< which means to say that this 10de has a which means to say that this 10de has a chance< chance of getting early assigned again chance of getting early assigned again because< because it was early assigned before and because it was early assigned before and right< right now you still have pretty much the right now you still have pretty much the same< same position so it could get early same position so it could get early assigned< assigned again so now some people may assigned again so now some people may just< just want to hold on to spread and see just want to hold on to spread and see maybe< maybe the market can go back up yes you maybe the market can go back up yes you can< can do that but just be aware that you can do that but just be aware that you could< could be early assigned again and you could be early assigned again and you have< have to do this whole three steps over have to do this whole three steps over again< again or rather just this one step down again or rather just this one step down here< here step three so what can you do here step three so what can you do instead< instead of this to avoid this early instead of this to avoid this early assignment< assignment well there are two options assignment well there are two options well< well the first option A very simple one well the first option A very simple one is< is to just simply close up for a loss is to just simply close up for a loss that< that is lesser than a Max loss right that is lesser than a Max loss right it's< it's less it's better than if you were it's less it's better than if you were to< to exercise your this put option when to exercise your this put option when you< you had the long hundred shares right so you had the long hundred shares right so just< just close out for a loss and then wait just close out for a loss and then wait for< for another opportunity remember there for another opportunity remember there is< is no need to win every single trade is no need to win every single trade right< right as long as you put on the iron right as long as you put on the iron Condor< Condor with the right mechanics over Condor with the right mechanics over time< time you should be able to be profitable time you should be able to be profitable now< now what about option number two right now what about option number two right option< option number two is if you still want option number two is if you still want to< to hold on to this iron Condor and you to hold on to this iron Condor and you think< think that the market has a possibility think that the market has a possibility of< of it coming back up now if this is the of it coming back up now if this is the case< case then option two you can go with case then option two you can go with this< this basically what it is is to roll this basically what it is is to roll your< your put option first of all you want to your put option first of all you want to roll< roll your put option to a further DTE so roll your put option to a further DTE so let's< let's say for example it's at 10 DTE and let's say for example it's at 10 DTE and then< then to roll to a further one let's say then to roll to a further one let's say you< you roll to the next uh 45 DTE okay so you roll to the next uh 45 DTE okay so when< when you roll this to 45 DTE it's likely when you roll this to 45 DTE it's likely that< that you're going to to roll for a debit that you're going to to roll for a debit right< right so this is going to be for a debit right so this is going to be for a debit so< so let me write the word down here debit so let me write the word down here debit DBT< DBT so this will be for a debit because DBT so this will be for a debit because your< your price the market is actually in the your price the market is actually in the money< money so most of the time the in the money so most of the time the in the money< money put spread if you were to roll out money put spread if you were to roll out is< is actually going to be for a debit is actually going to be for a debit instead< instead of a credit unless this uh price instead of a credit unless this uh price right< right now this market price is somewhere right now this market price is somewhere near< near where the shot put is so a general near where the shot put is so a general rule< rule of thumb if the market is nearer to rule of thumb if the market is nearer to the< the shot put strike then you can roll the shot put strike then you can roll for< for credit but it's closer to your long for credit but it's closer to your long put< put strike and if it's way past your put strike and if it's way past your long< long put Sprite basically below your long put Sprite basically below your long< long put strike then it's going to be long put strike then it's going to be for< for a debit now once you have done this for a debit now once you have done this the< the next thing you want to do is to deal the next thing you want to do is to deal with< with the call spread side because right with the call spread side because right now< now the call spread side you can now the call spread side you can actually< actually roll down and out when you roll actually roll down and out when you roll down< down and out you actually get credit and down and out you actually get credit and this< this can actually offset whatever debit this can actually offset whatever debit that< that you have when you are rolling the that you have when you are rolling the put< put spread so overall you could actually put spread so overall you could actually still< still get a credit for doing this so by still get a credit for doing this so by the< the way if you're not sure how to roll the way if you're not sure how to roll an< an iron Condor actually have a video on an iron Condor actually have a video on rolling< rolling that just go to my channel and rolling that just go to my channel and then< then look for that video all right so then look for that video all right so these< these are the two options that you can these are the two options that you can do< do after unwinding your assignment all do after unwinding your assignment all right< right so now let's get into the call right so now let's get into the call spread< spread side so what happens when you spread side so what happens when you assign< assign on your short call late so this assign on your short call late so this is< is the opposite of the shot put so if is the opposite of the shot put so if you< you assign on your shot put you get long you assign on your shot put you get long 100< 100 shares but if you get a sign on your 100 shares but if you get a sign on your short< short call what happens is now you'll be short call what happens is now you'll be short< short a hundred shares at the short call short a hundred shares at the short call Lake< Lake strike price so when you look at Lake strike price so when you look at your< your positions suddenly you won't see an your positions suddenly you won't see an iron< iron Condor but rather you will see this iron Condor but rather you will see this position< position down here you will see that you position down here you will see that you have< have shot a hundred shares at whatever have shot a hundred shares at whatever the< the strike price is all right let's say the strike price is all right let's say maybe< maybe this strike price down here is at maybe this strike price down here is at a< a hundred and twenty dollars so what a hundred and twenty dollars so what happens< happens is that when you shot your happens is that when you shot your shares< shares you again have to put up Margin shares you again have to put up Margin and< and this is where you could get a margin and this is where you could get a margin call< call if you don't have sufficient funds call if you don't have sufficient funds to< to short the 100 shares so in this case to short the 100 shares so in this case what< what do you do so again people have what do you do so again people have mentioned< mentioned all you have to do is just mentioned all you have to do is just exercise< exercise this call option but again as exercise this call option but again as you< you already know by now if you were to you already know by now if you were to exercise< exercise this call option it just means exercise this call option it just means that< that you're going to take the max loss that you're going to take the max loss of< of this width which you have no reason of this width which you have no reason to< to right there's no reason for you to go to right there's no reason for you to go and< and take the max loss of this call and take the max loss of this call option< option so instead we also want to use option so instead we also want to use the< the same three steps so in this case the same three steps so in this case the< the three steps will be this so first of the three steps will be this so first of all< all you buy back the hundred shares all you buy back the hundred shares right< right when you buy with 100 shares you right when you buy with 100 shares you have< have no positions now you want to sell have no positions now you want to sell the< the original Short call strike price the original Short call strike price again< again at the same strike price and the again at the same strike price and the same< same DTE just. to re-establish the same same DTE just to re-establish the same iron< iron condo which you have first iron condo which you have first initiated< initiated right now step three is initiated right now step three is basically< basically the same as step one and step basically the same as step one and step two< two right you put this two steps two right you put this two steps together< together you do it in a single order together you do it in a single order ticket ticket ticket and< and you will be able to get this right and you will be able to get this right so< so this way again no legging risk all so this way again no legging risk all right< right so what do you do after you have right so what do you do after you have unwinded< unwinded your assignment again same unwinded your assignment again same thing< thing as the put side you are still not thing as the put side you are still not out< out of the woods right you could get out of the woods right you could get early< early assigned on your short call again early assigned on your short call again and< and that's not what we want so similarly and that's not what we want so similarly there< there are two options right the first there are two options right the first options< options is to simply just close out the options is to simply just close out the spread< spread for a loss and wait for another spread for a loss and wait for another opportunity< opportunity the second option is if you opportunity the second option is if you still< still feel that you know you want to still feel that you know you want to hold< hold on to this uh iron Condor and you hold on to this uh iron Condor and you think< think that the market can actually just think that the market can actually just retrace< retrace back down into your profit Zone retrace back down into your profit Zone then< then what you could do is this so first then what you could do is this so first of< of all you roll the entire call spread of all you roll the entire call spread out< out to a further DTE so the same thing out to a further DTE so the same thing as< as what we did with the put spread side as what we did with the put spread side assignment< assignment so you roll out to a further assignment so you roll out to a further DTE< DTE and then for your put spread side DTE and then for your put spread side same< same thing what you want to do is you same thing what you want to do is you want< want to roll it up this time closer to want to roll it up this time closer to the< the market and then roll out to a the market and then roll out to a further< further DTE as well and basically the further DTE as well and basically the DTE< DTE for the call spread and the put DTE for the call spread and the put spread< spread you now want it to be the same so spread you now want it to be the same so this< this way now now you have a longer dated this way now now you have a longer dated iron< iron Condor although now you know you iron Condor although now you know you will< will have a slightly tighter Max profit will have a slightly tighter Max profit zone< zone right let's say for example if you zone right let's say for example if you were< were to roll to this point down here so were to roll to this point down here so maybe< maybe previously it was 100 you roll the maybe previously it was 100 you roll the put< put spread out maybe now it's one one put spread out maybe now it's one one zero< zero so now you have a slightly tighter zero so now you have a slightly tighter iron< iron Condor but what you have done is iron Condor but what you have done is that< that you have actually extended the life that you have actually extended the life of< of this iron Condor right in hopes that of this iron Condor right in hopes that if< if the market comes back down you can if the market comes back down you can still< still profit from this iron Condor now still

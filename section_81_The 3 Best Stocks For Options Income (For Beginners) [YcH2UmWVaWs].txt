Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video I'm< I'm gonna be sharing with you in my I'm gonna be sharing with you in my opinion< opinion what I think are the three best opinion what I think are the three best stocks< stocks for generating an options income stocks for generating an options income and< and this is suitable for you if you're and this is suitable for you if you're just< just starting out right you're a just starting out right you're a beginner< beginner or you haven't traded you know beginner or you haven't traded you know for< for more than a year right so if you're for more than a year right so if you're trading< trading for less than a year then these trading for less than a year then these three< three stocks you can certainly use as three stocks you can certainly use as well< well to trade options on all right so well to trade options on all right so let's< let's Dive Right In starting with the let's Dive Right In starting with the first< first one so the first one the ticker first one so the first one the ticker symbol< symbol is XSP now XSP is not a stock per symbol is XSP now XSP is not a stock per se< se but rather it's a cash settle index se but rather it's a cash settle index options< options right so what is the XSP so the options right so what is the XSP so the XSP< XSP is basically the mini SPX cash XSP is basically the mini SPX cash shuttle< shuttle index option so I'm pretty sure shuttle index option so I'm pretty sure you< you have heard of the SPX so if you you have heard of the SPX so if you haven't< haven't traded SPX before maybe because haven't traded SPX before maybe because it's< it's too big then you can trade the XSP it's too big then you can trade the XSP because< because the notional size is much because the notional size is much smaller< smaller right it's one tenth the size of smaller right it's one tenth the size of SPX< SPX and has the same notional size as SPX and has the same notional size as spy< spy which is the index ETF right the S P spy which is the index ETF right the S P 500< 500 Index ETF so if you have been 500 Index. ETF so if you have been trading< trading the SP why then you can trading the SP why then you can certainly< certainly trade the XSP as well and the certainly trade the XSP as well and the difference< difference is that the XSP is actually difference is that the XSP is actually cash< cash settled right so there's no cash settled right so there's no assignment< assignment of share so I'll go deeper assignment of share so I'll go deeper into< into this so why is this a good into this so why is this a good underlying< underlying to trade options for underlying to trade options for beginners< beginners well first of all it has beginners well first of all it has decently< decently good liquidity and relatively decently good liquidity and relatively tight< tight bid in our spread so this is one tight bid in our spread so this is one of< of the conditions that we want to look of the conditions that we want to look into< into before trading any underlying right into before trading any underlying right be< be it the stocks or index ETF or in this be it the stocks or index ETF or in this case< case index options so what we want to case index options so what we want to take< take a look at is the bid in our spread take a look at is the bid in our spread so< so as you can see down here if you will so as you can see down here if you will take< take a look at roughly the add the money take a look at roughly the add the money options< options so you can see down here these options so you can see down here these are< are the put options so the spread is are the put options so the spread is actually< actually pretty tight right it is 13 actually pretty tight right it is 13 cents< cents this is 13 cents down here this cents this is 13 cents down here this one< one down here is also 13 cents so they one down here is also 13 cents so they are< are all pretty much around 13 cents wide are all pretty much around 13 cents wide which< which is pretty decent because this is a which is pretty decent because this is a you< you know a pretty high price underlying you know a pretty high price underlying right< right it's 440 dollars so for a 7. 97 on right it's 440 dollars so for a 7.

97 on the< the bid and Eight dollar ten cents you the bid and Eight dollar ten cents you know< know 13 cents is actually pretty know 13 cents is actually pretty acceptable< acceptable right so this is something acceptable right so this is something that< that you want to look into before you that you want to look into before you trade< trade any underlying now the next reason trade any underlying now the next reason is< is that it's not as volatile well as is that it's not as volatile well as individual< individual stocks so as you can see down individual stocks so as you can see down here< here in this chart down here this graph here in this chart down here this graph I've< I've actually shared this graph quite a I've actually shared this graph quite a number< number of times in my other videos but number of times in my other videos but basically< basically as you can see down here the basically as you can see down here the ETFs< ETFs the movements are much more ETFs the movements are much more controlled< controlled and much more smaller it controlled and much more smaller it stays< stays in a narrower range compared to stays in a narrower range compared to individual< individual stocks right so for the XSP individual stocks right so for the XSP we< we can classify this under the ETFs we can classify this under the ETFs right< right for this graph mainly because XSP right for this graph mainly because XSP is< is the S P 500 right it has 500 stocks is the S P 500 right it has 500 stocks rather< rather than just one individual stock so rather than just one individual stock so as< as you know if you have a basket of as you know if you have a basket of stocks< stocks the movements are going to be stocks the movements are going to be much< much more muted compared to individual much more muted compared to individual stocks< stocks right because you have certain stocks right because you have certain stocks< stocks that may go up certain stocks go stocks that may go up certain stocks go down< down and they're going to negate the down and they're going to negate the movements< movements for each other so that is why movements for each other so that is why you< you can see down here the study have you can see down here the study have shown< shown by tastytrade that the ETFs or shown by tastytrade that the ETFs or rather< rather you know underlyings where there rather you know underlyings where there is< is a basket of stocks compared to just is a basket of stocks compared to just individual< individual stocks they're going to stay individual stocks they're going to stay in< in a narrower range compared to in a narrower range compared to individual< individual stocks which is exactly what individual stocks which is exactly what we< we want when we are trading income we want when we are trading income strategies< strategies right income strategies like strategies right income strategies like the< the iron Condor the strangle Jade lizard the iron Condor the strangle Jade lizard credit< credit spread so on and so forth so credit spread so on and so forth so these< these are strategies where we want the these are strategies where we want the underlying< underlying to pretty much stay within underlying to pretty much stay within the< the expected move so that is why this is the expected move so that is why this is a< a pretty good underlying for us to trade a pretty good underlying for us to trade compared< compared to you know volatile individual compared to you know volatile individual stocks< stocks also the XSP is a European style stocks also the XSP is a European style options< options which means to say there is no options which means to say there is no early< early assignment risk so you can hold to early assignment risk so you can hold to expiration< expiration if you want to even if your expiration if you want to even if your options< options are in the money right so one of options are in the money right so one of the< the biggest thing that you know many the biggest thing that you know many beginners< beginners fear when they come into beginners fear when they come into trading< trading options is getting a sign right trading options is getting a sign right they're< they're afraid of getting the options in they're afraid of getting the options in the< the money because if they get a sign you the money because if they get a sign you know< know on the put side you're going to be know on the put side you're going to be long< long 100 shares if you're going to be long 100 shares if you're going to be assigned< assigned on your call option then you're assigned on your call option then you're going< going to be short 100 shares and if you going to be short 100 shares and if you don't< don't have the necessary funds you're don't have the necessary funds you're going< going to get margin calls so it's going going to get margin calls so it's going to< to be very you know messy especially if to be very you know messy especially if you< you want to unwind them so a lot of you want to unwind them so a lot of people< people kind of get scared right they people kind of get scared right they always< always you know will reach out to me and always you know will reach out to me and ask< ask me oh my options are in the money ask me oh my options are in the money what< what do I do so should I just you know what do I do so should I just you know close< close them out should I do this or that close them out should I do this or that so< so the alternative is actually just to so the alternative is actually just to trade< trade XSP right because even though if trade XSP right because even though if your< your strikes are in the money well guess your strikes are in the money well guess what< what there is not going to be any what there is not going to be any assignment< assignment because for European style assignment because for European style options< options you can only get assigned at options you can only get assigned at expiration< expiration so even though if your expiration so even though if your options< options are in the money there's no need options are in the money there's no need to< to worry you can actually hold the to worry you can actually hold the spread< spread all the way to expiration and spread all the way to expiration and that's< that's what quite a lot of people want that's what quite a lot of people want right< right A lot of people want to achieve right A lot of people want to achieve the< the maximum profit of any spread they're the maximum profit of any spread they're trading< trading right so for example when they trading right so for example when they want< want to trade the iron Condor right A want to trade the iron Condor right A lot< lot of people will be you know wanting lot of people will be you know wanting to< to capture this maximum profit down here to capture this maximum profit down here this< this maximum profit Zone and the only this maximum profit Zone and the only way< way you can do this is if you hold it to way you can do this is if you hold it to expiration< expiration now if you were to do it on expiration now if you were to do it on like< like spiders spy which is index ETF if like spiders spy which is index ETF if. the< the market right goes beyond this short the market right goes beyond this short strike< strike down here on the put side or goes strike down here on the put side or goes beyond< beyond the call strike down here then beyond the call strike down here then you< you know there is a chance for early you know there is a chance for early assignment< assignment then you're going to get assignment then you're going to get assigned< assigned shares and that's going to assigned shares and that's going to pretty< pretty much you know mess up your trade pretty much you know mess up your trade right< right so with XSP there's no such thing right so with XSP there's no such thing as< as early assignment now it's also cash as early assignment now it's also cash settle< settle which means to say you're not settle which means to say you're not going< going to get shares right so there is going to get shares right so there is assignment< assignment but the assignment is only assignment but the assignment is only upon< upon expiration and upon expiration upon expiration and upon expiration what's< what's going to happen is that it's just what's going to happen is that it's just going< going to tabulate you know your p l if going to tabulate you know your p l if it's< it's going to be in a profit then what it's going to be in a profit then what it's< it's going to do it's going to credit it's going to do it's going to credit your< your account it's going to be in a loss your account it's going to be in a loss then< then it's going to debit into your then it's going to debit into your trading< trading account so there's no assignment trading account so there's no assignment of< of shares so you don't have to be of shares so you don't have to be worried< worried about any sort of Margin Call worried about any sort of Margin Call Due< Due to being assigned shares right so if Due to being assigned shares right so if you< you are just starting out XSP could you are just starting out XSP could actually< actually be a very good vehicle for you actually be a very good vehicle for you to< to just get started and not worry about to just get started and not worry about assignment< assignment so what strategies can you assignment so what strategies can you trade< trade with the XSP right so there are a trade with the XSP right so there are a number< number of strategies that you can trade number of strategies that you can trade well< well the first one you can trade the well the first one you can trade the bull< bull put spread so this is a bullish bull put spread so this is a bullish strategy< strategy again I have quite a number of strategy again I have quite a number of videos< videos on this on my channel just go videos on this on my channel just go ahead< ahead to my channel and search for bull ahead to my channel and search for bull put< put spread then next you have the bear put spread then next you have the bear call< call spread which is just the call side call spread which is just the call side right< right it's the counterpart of the blue right it's the counterpart of the blue put< put spread and and is a neutral to put spread and and is a neutral to bearish< bearish strategy where you want the bearish strategy where you want the market< market to go down again if the market market to go down again if the market let's< let's say goes all the way up and then let's say goes all the way up and then there's< there's still maybe 10 days left to there's still maybe 10 days left to expiration< expiration well at this point you can expiration well at this point you can actually< actually just choose to hold on to the actually just choose to hold on to the spread< spread right because there's no early spread right because there's no early assignment< assignment you don't have to be afraid assignment you don't have to be afraid that< that this short call down here is going that this short call down here is going to< to translate to 100 shares and get a to translate to 100 shares and get a sign< sign right because that's not going to sign right because that's not going to happen< happen with XSP so you can actually hold happen with XSP so you can actually hold it< it and who knows maybe during the last it and who knows maybe during the last 10< 10 days of this options live the market 10 days of this options live the market could< could actually come back down and you could actually come back down and you could< could be in a profit for this trade and could be in a profit for this trade and finally< finally you can trade the iron Condor finally you can trade the iron Condor right< right so the iron Condor again I have right so the iron Condor again I have many< many videos on my channel just go ahead many videos on my channel just go ahead to< to my channel and search for iron Condor to my channel and search for iron Condor and< and the good thing about trading this on and the good thing about trading this on XSP< XSP is that you know you can try to get XSP is that you know you can try to get the< the max profit by simply holding all the the max profit by simply holding all the way< way to expiration right if the market way to expiration right if the market stays< stays somewhere within this Zone then stays somewhere within this Zone then guess< guess what you're going to get the max guess what you're going to get the max profit< profit of this iron Condor trade so even profit of this iron Condor trade so even though< though let's say the market goes all the though let's say the market goes all the way< way down way down and< and there's still like 20 days left to and there's still like 20 days left to expiration< expiration just hold on to it and if the expiration just hold on to it and if the market< market does come back up again then you market does come back up again then you are< are you know possibly going to be able are you know possibly going to be able to< to hit the max profit of this iron to hit the max profit of this iron Condor< Condor all right so the second Condor all right so the second underlying< underlying to trade for options income underlying to trade for options income would< would be the QQQ or in short

com blueprint all< all right back to the video to write the all right back to the video to write the cues< cues is the technology sector index ETF cues is the technology sector index ETF so< so again this is not an individual stock so again this is not an individual stock but< but rather it is a basket of stocks but rather it is a basket of stocks right< right more accurately it is a basket of right more accurately it is a basket of a< a hundred stocks from the tech sector so a hundred stocks from the tech sector so you< you have stocks like the Amazon the you have stocks like the Amazon the Google< Google so on and so forth inside so one Google so on and so forth inside so one of< of the reasons is why I like the cues is of the reasons is why I like the cues is well< well one of them is because I did pretty well one of them is because I did pretty well< well with them and secondly is that it well with them and secondly is that it is< is also an index ETF which I mentioned is also an index ETF which I mentioned previously< previously before compared to individual previously before compared to individual stocks< stocks is slightly muted but at the same stocks is slightly muted but at the same time< time it has pretty high volatility time it has pretty high volatility compared< compared to its counterparts you know compared to its counterparts you know like< like rwm and spiders right so let me get like rwm and spiders right so let me get into< into the reasons why I think this is a into the reasons why I think this is a good< good underlying to trade options for good underlying to trade options for beginners< beginners so the first reason is that it beginners so the first reason is that it has< has very very good liquidity and very has very very good liquidity and very tight< tight beta spread right so if you take a tight beta spread right so if you take a look< look at the at the money put option down look at the at the money put option down here< here you can see. that this is only 7 here you can see that this is only 7 cents< cents wide right and the underlying is cents wide right and the underlying is about< about 300 plus right this is 7 cents about 300 plus right this is 7 cents white< white down here down here is five cents white down here down here is five cents wide< wide down here is roughly six cents wide wide down here is roughly six cents wide so< so as you can see they are all under 10 so as you can see they are all under 10 cents< cents which is pretty good right so this cents which is pretty good right so this is< is considered very tight already and is is considered very tight already and is considered< considered very liquid now NYX is also considered very liquid now NYX is also known< known as volatile compared to its known as volatile compared to its individual< individual counterparts as I mentioned individual counterparts as I mentioned with< with XSP because again these are all with XSP because again these are all basket< basket of stocks and not individual basket of stocks and not individual stocks< stocks and it has higher volatility stocks and it has higher volatility relative< relative to its index ETS Pierce right relative to its index ETS Pierce right so< so if you were to talk about index ETFs so if you were to talk about index ETFs then< then qqqs will be one of the ones where then qqqs will be one of the ones where it< it has higher volatility compared to its it has higher volatility compared to its other< other you know peers right like the other you know peers right like the spiders< spiders iwm and the Diamonds right so spiders iwm and the Diamonds right so these< these are the big four index ETFs on the these are the big four index ETFs on the right< right hand side down here so as you can right hand side down here so as you can see< see for the qqqs the IV as you can see see for the qqqs the IV as you can see over< over here for this date right 20th over here for this date right 20th October< October 54 DTE lab is 22. 3 percent right October 54 DTE lab is 22.

3 percent right the< the next in line will be iwm 21. 29 the next in line will be iwm 21.

29 spiders< spiders is much lesser 17. 19 and spiders is much lesser 17.

19 and diamonds< diamonds is 15. 13 so if you're going to diamonds is 15.

13 so if you're going to talk< talk about you know higher volatility to talk about you know higher volatility to get< get more premium then QQQ is you know get more premium then QQQ is you know among< among one of the highest for the index among one of the highest for the index ETF< ETF so that is why it's actually pretty ETF so that is why it's actually pretty good< good for us to trade you know options good for us to trade you know options income< income strategies on because we're gonna income strategies on because we're gonna get< get pretty decent premium as well so get pretty decent premium as well so what's< what's your strategies can you trade on what's your strategies can you trade on the< the qqqs well similarly to the XSP you the qqqs well similarly to the XSP you can< can trade the blue put spread you can can trade the blue put spread you can trade< trade the back hole spread and you can trade the back hole spread and you can treat< treat the iron Condor as well now the treat the iron Condor as well now the only< only difference is that for the qqqs I only difference is that for the qqqs I actually< actually do not suggest that you hold actually do not suggest that you hold all< all the way to expiration because this all the way to expiration because this is< is American style options which means to is American style options which means to say< say there is early assignment so for say there is early assignment so for example< example if the market was to bridge your example if the market was to bridge your short< short strike before expiration let's say short strike before expiration let's say maybe< maybe there is 15 DTE Left Right which maybe there is 15 DTE Left Right which means< means to save 15 days left to the means to save 15 days left to the expiration< expiration of the options then there's expiration of the options then there's always< always a chance that the buyer of your always a chance that the buyer of your this< this shot put option could actually just this shot put option could actually just exercise< exercise it and then you're going to be exercise it and then you're going to be long< long 100 shares and if you're going to long 100 shares and if you're going to learn< learn 100 shares at roughly what 332 learn 100 shares at roughly what 332 dollars< dollars that's going to be 33 200 that dollars that's going to be 33 200 that you< you need in order to fund this shares you need in order to fund this shares right< right this hundred shares so if you right this hundred shares so if you don't< don't have that then it's easily going don't have that then it's easily going to< to get you into a margin call so that is to get you into a margin call so that is why< why if you're going to trade the index why if you're going to trade the index ETFs< ETFs then you want to have an exit plan ETFs then you want to have an exit plan that< that is not where you hold all the way that is not where you hold all the way to< to expiration especially if the market to expiration especially if the market is< is in the money right either side of is in the money right either side of your< your strikes before expiration okay so your strikes before expiration okay so again< again I have a lot of videos on again I have a lot of videos on strategies< strategies on what you can do so just go strategies on what you can do so just go ahead< ahead and watch them now last but not ahead and watch them now last but not least< least is an actual stock and that is least is an actual stock and that is Google< Google so Google or known as alphabet Google so Google or known as alphabet company< company is actually a tech stock right company is actually a tech stock right so< so this is an individual stock and I so this is an individual stock and I also< also like Google well one of the reasons also like Google well one of the reasons is< is also because you know I did pretty is also because you know I did pretty well< well on Google as well so why is this a well on Google as well so why is this a good< good underlying to trade options for good underlying to trade options for beginners< beginners so the first reason is that beginners so the first reason is that Google< Google has good liquidity and relatively Google has good liquidity and relatively tight< tight binana spread right Google is one tight binana spread right Google is one of< of the heavily traded stocks right it of the heavily traded stocks right it has< has millions of shares traded every has millions of shares traded every single< single day and I did not put the bit and single day and I did not put the bit and I'll< I'll spread down here but you can just I'll spread down here but you can just go< go ahead to your platform you can see go ahead to your platform you can see that< that it's actually pretty tight right that it's actually pretty tight right it's< it's not as tight as the qqqs or maybe it's not as tight as the qqqs or maybe even< even the spy but it's decent enough even the spy but it's decent enough right< right decent enough for us to trade our right decent enough for us to trade our strategies< strategies it also has decently good strategies it also has decently good volatility< volatility right so as you can see down volatility right so as you can see down here< here on the option chain you can see here on the option chain you can see this< this is the volatility so it's not that this is the volatility so it's not that absolutely< absolutely high but it's not that low as absolutely high but it's not that low as well< well so it's decent enough for us to get well so it's decent enough for us to get some< some good premium when we're trading some good premium when we're trading income< income strategies as well next in my income strategies as well next in my opinion< opinion I think that Google is actually opinion I think that Google is actually a< a fundamentally good stock now I know a fundamentally good stock now I know that< that you know the term fundamentally that you know the term fundamentally good< good stock can be pretty subjective good stock can be pretty subjective right< right so this is where you want to do right so this is where you want to do your< your due diligence right just don't take your due diligence right just don't take it< it straight from me go ahead and do your it straight from me go ahead and do your own< own homework to find out whether it's own homework to find out whether it's fundamentally< fundamentally good for you but if you fundamentally good for you but if you were< were to go to Google Finance you will were to go to Google Finance you will see< see that the revenue is actually see that the revenue is actually increasing< increasing year on year and also the net increasing year on year and also the net income< income which is the one in yellow is income which is the one in yellow is also< also increasing as well so generally if also increasing as well so generally if a< a company is making money right a company is making money right increasing< increasing its cash flow increasing its increasing its cash flow increasing its revenue< revenue and net income over time then I revenue and net income over time then I would< would consider this you know a pretty would consider this you know a pretty good< good stock to trade for the long term as good stock to trade for the long term as well< well so that is why most of the time I'm well so that is why most of the time I'm pretty< pretty bullish on the underlying and pretty bullish on the underlying and generally< generally you. know avoid going for any generally you know avoid going for any bearish< bearish strategies on such kind of bearish strategies on such kind of fundamentally< fundamentally good stock right so this fundamentally good stock right so this way< way you know at least you have a margin way you know at least you have a margin of< of safety whereby you know if it's a of safety whereby you know if it's a fundamentally< fundamentally good stock even though if fundamentally good stock even though if you< you get hit on your put options and your you get hit on your put options and your long< long 100 shares you don't really have to long 100 shares you don't really have to worry< worry as much compared to you know if worry as much compared to you know if you< you were holding stocks like AMC or you were holding stocks like AMC or GameStop< GameStop right because in the long term GameStop right because in the long term if< if you believe in the company you think if you believe in the company you think that< that the fundamentals are good then it that the fundamentals are good then it should< should rise over time also as of this should rise over time also as of this recording< recording according to Simply Wall recording according to Simply Wall Street< Street right which is just a website Street right which is just a website that< that you know evaluates stocks so that you know evaluates stocks so according< according to Simply Wall Street Google according to Simply Wall Street Google right< right now is undervalued right you can right now is undervalued right you can see< see that the current prices of this see that the current prices of this recording< recording is about 130 dollars and recording is about 130 dollars and simply< simply Wall Street you know give a fair simply Wall Street you know give a fair value< value of around 181 dollars so according value of around 181 dollars so according to< to them it is undervalued right now but to them it is undervalued right now but again< again there are many different sites again there are many different sites that< that will give you their valuations and that will give you their valuations and whether< whether they think the stock is whether they think the stock is undervalued< undervalued so this is where you want to undervalued so this is where you want to do< do your due diligence for me personally do your due diligence for me personally I< I still think that Google is a little I still think that Google is a little bit< bit undervalued so that is why you know bit undervalued so that is why you know I< I only go for mostly bullish strategies I only go for mostly bullish strategies as< as opposed to bearish strategies so what as opposed to bearish strategies so what strategies< strategies to trade on Google so for strategies to trade on Google so for Google< Google you can trade the bull put spread Google you can trade the bull put spread so< so again this is a bullish strategy you so again this is a bullish strategy you can< can also trade the shot put if you have can also trade the shot put if you have more< more Capital so Google is about a more Capital so Google is about a hundred< hundred and thirty dollars right now so hundred and thirty dollars right now so it's< it's not that expensive compared to you it's not that expensive compared to you know< know the index ETFs which is much higher know the index ETFs which is much higher priced< priced at around you know 300 and 400 priced at around you know 300 and 400 like< like the spy and the qqqs right so for like the spy and the qqqs right so for Google< Google if you have the funds you can Google if you have the funds you can actually< actually go for a shot put and also you actually go for a shot put and also you can< can trade the wheel strategy on Google can trade the wheel strategy on Google or< or better yet the income grid real or better yet the income grid real strategy< strategy so if you're not familiar with strategy so if you're not familiar with what< what the income grid view strategy is I what the income grid

============================================================================

Language: en hey< hey guys davis here so in this video i hey guys davis here so in this video i want< want to share with you how you can use want to share with you how you can use leaps< leaps options to get your favorite leaps options to get your favorite stocks< stocks at half price or less and this is stocks at half price or less and this is very< very important especially right now as very important especially right now as the< the market is really tanking and you the market is really tanking and you want< want to limit your risk to the downside want to limit your risk to the downside by< by 50 or more so i'm gonna share with by 50 or more so i'm gonna share with you< you exactly how you can do that in this you exactly how you can do that in this video< video but first off we want to know video but first off we want to know exactly< exactly what are leaps options so lips exactly what are leaps options so lips is< is basically just an acronym and it is basically just an acronym and it stands< stands for long-term equity anticipation stands for long-term equity anticipation securities< securities and if you were to take a securities and if you were to take a look< look at the option chain in your look at the option chain in your brokerage< brokerage software brokerage software you< you will see that there is actually no you will see that there is actually no label< label on the label on the option< option chain whether it's leaps or not option chain whether it's leaps or not so< so basically it's just characterized so basically it's just characterized as< as having a as having a dte< dte which is days to expiration of more dte which is days to expiration of more than< than one year than one year now< now same thing leaps there are puts and now same thing leaps there are puts and calls< calls so call leaves are generally meant calls so call leaves are generally meant as< as stock replacement strategy and it's as stock replacement strategy and it's better< better to use on non-dividend stocks better to use on non-dividend stocks because< because you do not get dividends with because you do not get dividends with options< options so if you were to just buy the options so if you were to just buy the stock< stock and if uh the option the stock was stock and if uh the option the stock was to< to pay you a dividend then on the x to pay you a dividend then on the x dividend< dividend date stock will theoretically dividend date stock will theoretically go< go down by the same amount that the go down by the same amount that the dividend< dividend is being paid out so you dividend is being paid out so you actually< actually do not lose anything when you actually do not lose anything when you are< are owning the stock but if you own a are owning the stock but if you own a call< call leaps you actually do not get paid call leaps you actually do not get paid the< the dividend so the value of your the dividend so the value of your options< options is actually tied to the stock so options is actually tied to the stock so if< if the stock goes down your option value if the stock goes down your option value will< will drop as well but you are not being will drop as well but you are not being paid< paid the dividend so it's best for you paid the dividend so it's best for you i< i would say that it's much better to use i would say that it's much better to use on< on a non-dividend stocks or at least on on a non-dividend stocks or at least on a< a stock that pays a stock that pays very< very little dividends very little dividends there's< there's also put leaps as well and it's there's also put leaps as well and it's generally< generally meant for long term portfolio generally meant for long term portfolio protection< protection to the downside so this is protection to the downside so this is where< where many people tend to use where many people tend to use by< by put lips on index etfs by put lips on index etfs as< as a general protection in case the as a general protection in case the market< market goes down so for the purpose of market goes down so for the purpose of this< this video i'll just only be talking this video i'll just only be talking about< about the call leaps options about the call leaps options so< so you must be wondering why buy leaves so you must be wondering why buy leaves versus< versus stock so here are some of the versus stock so here are some of the advantages< advantages so first of all you first of advantages so first of all you first of all< all you get to control a stock at half all you get to control a stock at half price< price or less now price or less now when< when i say control it means you just get when i say control it means you just get exposure< exposure to the underlying stock price exposure to the underlying stock price movement< movement you actually do not own the movement you actually do not own the stock stock stock so so so i< i want you to take a look at this uh i want you to take a look at this uh strike< strike price at 60 right here strike price at 60 right here you< you can see that the bid is about 53 the you can see that the bid is about 53 the offer< offer is about 54 so you can roughly buy offer is about 54 so you can roughly buy this< this option this option price< price at 54 dollars and just by itself price at 54 dollars and just by itself you< you can see you can see it's< it's really half the price of the it's really half the price of the current< current stock price so current stock current stock price so current stock price< price is about 108 if you were to buy a price is about 108 if you were to buy a hundred< hundred shares that is about ten hundred shares that is about ten thousand< thousand eight hundred dollars so by thousand eight hundred dollars so by paying< paying only uh five thousand four paying only uh five thousand four hundred< hundred dollars you can get the same hundred dollars you can get the same exposure< exposure of about 88 deltas exposure of about 88 deltas with< with very limited risk compared to if with very limited risk compared to if you< you were to buy a hundred shares of this you were to buy a hundred shares of this stock stock stock now< now of course you can choose to pay even now of course you can choose to pay even lesser< lesser if you will go to the 105 strike lesser if you will go to the 105 strike price< price as you can see price as you can see with< with the 105 strike you can buy this with the 105 strike you can buy this option< option at about 23 which is about 2 300 option at about 23 which is about 2 300 so< so you even further your limit to the so you even further your limit to the downside< downside but i want to caution you here downside but i want to caution you here because< because uh if you were to buy this uh at because uh if you were to buy this uh at the< the money the money option option. option you're< you're actually paying more in extrinsic you're actually paying more in extrinsic value< value you see if you would compare this value you see if you would compare this this< this is the extrinsic value column you this is the extrinsic value column you can< can see that with the 105 can see that with the 105 strike< strike price you're paying roughly 19 in strike price you're paying roughly 19 in terms< terms of extrinsic value whereas the 60 terms of extrinsic value whereas the 60 strike< strike you're only paying roughly about strike you're only paying roughly about five< five dollars so that's a big difference five dollars so that's a big difference and< and you must keep in mind that when the and you must keep in mind that when the option< option expires all extrinsic value will option expires all extrinsic value will go< go to zero go to zero so< so what you're actually buying here is so what you're actually buying here is is< is more extrinsic value although you are is more extrinsic value although you are reducing< reducing your risk most of this value is reducing your risk most of this value is actually< actually extrinsic value and that means actually extrinsic value and that means that that that the< the stock really has to go up a lot in the stock really has to go up a lot in order< order for you to break even and even order for you to break even and even profit profit profit compared< compared to if you were to buy a much compared to if you were to buy a much deeper< deeper in the money with a higher delta deeper in the money with a higher delta option option option all< all right but i'll get more into this in all right but i'll get more into this in the< the later slides the later slides so< so with leaps you can actually reduce so with leaps you can actually reduce your< your risk by half just by simply your risk by half just by simply deciding< deciding how much you want to pay for deciding how much you want to pay for the< the option so uh if you compare this the option so uh if you compare this stock< stock with stock let's say if you buy a stock with stock let's say if you buy a hundred< hundred shares of a stock that is worth hundred shares of a stock that is worth a< a hundred dollars and it goes to zero a hundred dollars and it goes to zero while< while you lose the full 100 times 100 while you lose the full 100 times 100 shares< shares that's ten thousand dollars but shares that's ten thousand dollars but if< if you bought the leaps options for if you bought the leaps options for fifty< fifty dollars it goes to zero then you fifty dollars it goes to zero then you only< only lose whatever you paid for which is only lose whatever you paid for which is a< a total of five thousand dollars so just a total of five thousand dollars so just by< by that you are really reducing your by that you are really reducing your risk risk risk while< while still being able to get exposure while still being able to get exposure to< and< and the other a good thing about lips is and the other a good thing about lips is that< that you actually make more as the stock that you actually make more as the stock goes< goes up and you lose less as the stock goes up and you lose less as the stock goes< goes down and that's because the delta goes down and that's because the delta is< is dynamic that means as the stock moves is dynamic that means as the stock moves the< the delta moves as well so delta is just the delta moves as well so delta is just a< a measurement of how much a measurement of how much the< the option price will go up a down per the option price will go up a down per dollar< dollar move dollar move in< in the underlying stock so let's say for in the underlying stock so let's say for example< example if you start off with a delta of example if you start off with a delta of 80 80 80 and< and if the stock price was to go up the and if the stock price was to go up the delta< delta will go up as well you go to 81 82 delta will go up as well you go to 81 82 90< 90 and eventually to 100 if the stock 90 and eventually to 100 if the stock really< really goes up enough really goes up enough so< so you're actually making more so you're actually making more as< as the stock goes up and contrastingly as the stock goes up and contrastingly if< if the if the stock< stock was to go down your delta will go stock was to go down your delta will go down< down as well that means you start to down as well that means you start to lose< lose less as the market goes down lose less as the market goes down compared< compared to if you were holding stock if compared to if you were holding stock if the< the stock goes down ten dollars well you the stock goes down ten dollars well you will< will lose ten dollars on your stock as will lose ten dollars on your stock as well< well but in terms of a leaps it will well but in terms of a leaps it will lose< lose lesser and lesser as it goes down lose lesser and lesser as it goes down so< so if the stock goes down ten dollars so if the stock goes down ten dollars chances< chances are you probably lose chances are you probably lose maybe< maybe only 90 80 or 70 dollars maybe only 90 80 or 70 dollars out< out of seven dollars out of that 10 move out of seven dollars out of that 10 move down down down so< so because of this you have better risk so because of this you have better risk to< to reward ratio right so let's say if to reward ratio right so let's say if you< you have a stock right a stock at you have a stock right a stock at hundred< hundred dollars the stock goes to 200 hundred dollars the stock goes to 200 that< that means you make a hundred dollars that means you make a hundred dollars and< and your risk is a hundred dollars then and your risk is a hundred dollars then your< your risk to reward is one is to one but your risk to reward is one is to one but with< with leaps your risk to reward is with leaps your risk to reward is slightly< slightly better because your risk is slightly better because your risk is fifty< fifty dollars and if the stock goes up fifty dollars and if the stock goes up by< by a hundred dollars by a hundred dollars your< your profit is not a hundred dollars but your profit is not a hundred dollars but you're you're you're very< very close to it because your delta by very close to it because your delta by then< then should be around 90 so you will then should be around 90 so you will make< make 90 out of the 100 move so if your make 90 out of the 100 move so if your profit< profit is 90 profit is 90 and< and your risk is only 50 which is what and your risk is only 50 which is what you< you paid for then your risk to reward is you paid for then your risk to reward is around< around one is to 1. 8 so your risk reward around one is to 1.

8 so your risk reward is< is much better just simply because you is much better just simply because you have< have really limited the downside by a have really limited the downside by a significant< significant amount significant amount so< so there are also disadvantages of leaps so there are also disadvantages of leaps compared< compared to stocks and it's always a compared to stocks and it's always a trade-off trade-off trade-off so< so like i mentioned before so like i mentioned before you< you do not get dividends you do not get dividends so so so when< when the stock actually pays dividends when the stock actually pays dividends your< your option your option price< price will go down and you do not get price will go down and you do not get paid< paid for it paid for it leaps< leaps also have a fixed lifespan and leaps also have a fixed lifespan and that's< that's the expiration date that's the expiration date so< so this is where so this is where it< it can get confusing for it can get confusing for a< a number of people because at expiration a number of people because at expiration you're< you're not sure what exactly happens so you're not sure what exactly happens so if< if your if your option< option is in the money at expiration option is in the money at expiration it< it will be converted to two shares at it will be converted to two shares at your< your strike price so for example if the your strike price so for example if the stock< stock price is a hundred dollars at stock price is a hundred dollars at expiration< expiration and your strike price is at expiration and your strike price is at seventy< seventy dollars then you will get a seventy dollars then you will get a hundred< hundred shares hundred shares at< at seventy dollars per contract at seventy dollars per contract but< but what happens if your option is out but what happens if your option is out of< of the money and expiration well it of the money and expiration well it simply< simply uh simply uh basically< basically just expires worthless so if basically just expires worthless so if the< the stock price is at a hundred dollars the stock price is at a hundred dollars at< at expiration your strike price is at at expiration your strike price is at 120 120 120 then< then your option will be worthless now then your option will be worthless now of< of course of course before< before the option expires you can before the option expires you can keep< keep rolling your option if you roll keep rolling your option if you roll your< your option you will increase the your option you will increase the lifespan< lifespan but each time you have to take lifespan but each time you have to take note< note that if you were to increase the note that if you were to increase the lifespan< lifespan you just roll it to a further lifespan you just roll it to a further expiration< expiration date you will have to pay expiration date you will have to pay more< more extrinsic value so you're just more extrinsic value so you're just paying< paying for more time to keep like the paying for more time to keep like the lifeline< lifeline of your options going so this lifeline of your options going so this is< is where you really need to is where you really need to understand< understand what you need to do understand what you need to do if< the< the other disadvantage like i. said you the other disadvantage like i said you have< have to pay extrinsic value which will have to pay extrinsic value which will decay< decay over the lifespan of the option decay over the lifespan of the option that< that is why as much as possible i want that is why as much as possible i want to< to pay as little extrinsic value per day to pay as little extrinsic value per day when< when it comes to buying options when it comes to buying options so< so here are three simple steps to so here are three simple steps to buy< buy leaps at 50 of the stock price and buy leaps at 50 of the stock price and this< this is my method this is my method so< so the first step what i'll do is i will so the first step what i'll do is i will look< look for the longest data option and the look for the longest data option and the only< only reason is because option premiums only reason is because option premiums per< per day are cheaper when the duration is per day are cheaper when the duration is longer< longer so it's the same analogy like if longer so it's the same analogy like if you< you were to just you were to just buy buy buy a< a bottle of mineral water let's say it a bottle of mineral water let's say it could< could just cost a dollar but if you were could just cost a dollar but if you were to< to buy a to buy a 100< 100 bottles of mineral water you might 100 bottles of mineral water you might get< get a discount on that so per bottle it get a discount on that so per bottle it might< might maybe cost you 80 cents or 70 might maybe cost you 80 cents or 70 cents< cents if you buy more so options work cents if you buy more so options work very< very similar to that where if you were very similar to that where if you were to< to go for the longer dated option you're to go for the longer dated option you're actually< actually paying lesser in terms of actually paying lesser in terms of premium< premium per day so if you will take a premium per day so if you will take a look< look at the strike price down here which look at the strike price down here which i've< i've uh i've uh boxed< boxed off here 110 strike price you can boxed off here 110 strike price you can see< see that this down here is the extrinsic see that this down here is the extrinsic value< value that you're paying for this option value that you're paying for this option so< so the extrinsic value for the 30 days so the extrinsic value for the 30 days to< to expiration strike at 110 is six to expiration strike at 110 is six dollars< dollars and eight cents so if you were dollars and eight cents so if you were to< to divide this by the number of days to divide this by the number of days left< left options left options uh< uh it is 20 roughly 20 cents now let's uh it is 20 roughly 20 cents now let's compare< compare this to a longer dated option compare this to a longer dated option which< which has a dte of 583 at the same which has a dte of 583 at the same strike< strike price so you can see that the strike price so you can see that the extrinsic< extrinsic value is 21. 30 extrinsic value is 21.

30 now< now in terms of absolute value is of now in terms of absolute value is of course< course much more expensive but if you course much more expensive but if you were< were to divide this by the number of were to divide this by the number of days< days left you will see that you're days left you will see that you're actually< actually only paying roughly three to actually only paying roughly three to four< four cents per day four cents per day compared< compared to paying 20 cents per day compared to paying 20 cents per day on< on the dt30 options and the reason is on the dt30 options and the reason is because< because the options because the options tend< tend to decay much faster when you reach tend to decay much faster when you reach the< the 30 to 45 days left in terms of the the 30 to 45 days left in terms of the expiration< expiration so as much as possible i expiration so as much as possible i always< always look for the longest data option always look for the longest data option because< because that's where i get the bank the because that's where i get the bank the most< most bang for my buck right you're most bang for my buck right you're paying< paying much lesser and the decay is much paying much lesser and the decay is much lesser lesser lesser right< right step number two what i'll do is right step number two what i'll do is i'll< i'll look for deep in the money calls i'll look for deep in the money calls which< which is where the delta is more than 80 which is where the delta is more than 80 and< and the reason is that the higher the and the reason is that the higher the delta< delta the lesser we are paying in terms delta the lesser we are paying in terms of< of extrinsic value so you can see down of extrinsic value so you can see down here< here this is the extrinsic value column here this is the extrinsic value column and< and this is the delta the higher the and this is the delta the higher the delta< delta the lesser you are paying in terms delta the lesser you are paying in terms of< of. extrinsic value of extrinsic value and< and it increases in terms of extrinsic and it increases in terms of extrinsic value< value as you get to at the money and it value as you get to at the money and it starts< starts tapering off as it goes out the starts tapering off as it goes out the money< money because at this point all you're money because at this point all you're doing< doing is you're just paying for doing is you're just paying for hope< hope basically you're just hoping that hope basically you're just hoping that the< the stock will go all the way up to your the stock will go all the way up to your strike< strike price and if it goes to your strike price and if it goes to your strike< strike price strike price you< you only break even it has to go a you only break even it has to go a significant< significant amount you have to go much significant amount you have to go much higher< higher in terms for you to profit so higher in terms for you to profit so that< that is why when buying leaps as a stock that is why when buying leaps as a stock replacement< replacement strategy strategy where you replacement strategy strategy where you want< want to hold this for the long term i want to hold this for the long term i would would would stay< stay away from out the money options stay away from out the money options so< so let's do a comparison here to see why so let's do a comparison here to see why i< i would prefer to buy the deep in the i would prefer to buy the deep in the money< money and pay slightly more compared to money and pay slightly more compared to pay< pay less for the pay less for the out< out of the money strikes so out of the money strikes so if< if you take a look at the 55 strike you if you take a look at the 55 strike you can< can see that the cost is roughly 50 can see that the cost is roughly 50 780< 780 you can see this is the mid price 780 you can see this is the mid price the< the bid is 57 the offer is 58. 7 so the the bid is 57 the offer is 58.

7 so the mid< mid price roughly 57. 80 mid price roughly 57.

80 and< and per option contract with 100 shares and per option contract with 100 shares that< that is 5780 that is 5780 now< now the break even how you calculate the now the break even how you calculate. the break< break events basically you take the break events basically you take the strike< strike price and you add the amount that strike price and you add the amount that you< you paid for it which is 57. 8 and you you paid for it which is 57.

8 and you can< can see that the break even is a hundred can see that the break even is a hundred and< and twelve dollars 80 cents and twelve dollars 80 cents right< right now as as of this uh right now as as of this uh screenshot< screenshot you can see that the stock screenshot you can see that the stock price< price is a hundred and eight dollars so price is a hundred and eight dollars so all< all it takes for it to break even is all it takes for it to break. even is roughly< roughly three dollars all you have to roughly three dollars all you have to move< move is about three dollars and change move is about three dollars and change for< for you to break even and any further for you to break even and any further than< than that you will be a profit so in than that you will be a profit so in terms< terms of percentage terms of percentage the< the stock only has to move from its the stock only has to move from its current< current price roughly 3. 79 current price roughly 3.

79 for< for you to break even for you to break even and< and then after that it's all profit now and then after that it's. all profit now let's< let's compare this to an out of the let's compare this to an out of the money< money strike which is 120. so this is money strike which is 120.

so this is not< not very far out of the money not very far out of the money but< but it's still a little bit out of the but it's still a little bit out of the money< money right 120 strike money right 120 strike so< so in terms of the cost you can see that so in terms of the cost you can see that you< you pay you pay significantly< significantly lesser you only pay a significantly lesser you only pay a thousand< thousand five hundred sixty dollars thousand five hundred sixty dollars because< because for this option because for this option you< you can only you you all you have to you can only you you all you have to just< just pay 15 60 just pay 15 60 right< right so right so it's< it's much lesser than if you buy the 55 it's much lesser than if you buy the 55 strike< strike price but you must ask yourself strike price but you must ask yourself the< the question at what cost the question at what cost so< so this is so this is where< where you want to calculate the break where you. want to calculate the break even< even so again you take the strike price even so again you take the strike price you< you add you add the< the premium that you paid for it and the premium that you paid for it and it's< it's 135 60 cents that means in order it's 135 60 cents that means in order for< for you to profit for you to profit at< at expiration the stock has to go above at expiration the stock has to go above 135< 135 dollars and 60 cents compared to 135 dollars and 60 cents compared to to< to the 55 strike all you have to do is to the 55 strike all you have to do is just< just go above 112 80 cents for you to just go above 112 80 cents for you to profit< profit so this is a huge movement profit so this is a huge movement so< so in terms of percentage movement so in terms of percentage movement you< you can see that the stock has to move you can see that the stock has to move from< from its current strike price from its current strike price 24. 77< 24.

77 percent 24. 77 percent in< in order for you to profit break even in order for you to profit break even. and< and even profit right the stock has to and even profit right the stock has to move< move 24.

#### Topic 1

77 move 24. 77 and< and your your and your your days< days to expiration days to expiration is is is slightly< slightly more than a year right maybe a slightly more than a year right maybe a year< year and a half year and a half so< so if a stock you have to make sure that so if a stock you have to make sure that you< you your timing is really right and it you your timing is really right and it has< has to go up by this much has to go up by this much in< in order for you to profit so this is in order for you to profit so this is the< the reason why i do not want to go for a the reason why i do not want to go for a strike< strike price that is at the money or out strike price that is at the money or out the< the money the money i< i would want to pay much more for it i would want to pay much more for it and< and then pay very little extrinsic value and then pay very little extrinsic value and< and all it takes is just a small and all it takes is just a small movement< movement for the stock to go up so movement for the stock to go up so just< just imagine this imagine somebody just imagine this imagine somebody was< was to say that hey i've got nike stock was to say that hey i've got nike stock right< right now at 108 dollars right now at 108 dollars all< all you have to do is just pay me all you have to do is just pay me 90< 90 dollars per share and you get to take 90 dollars per share and you get to take my< my stock my stock that's< that's worth a hundred eight dollars but that's worth a hundred eight dollars but you< you wanna do that you surely wanna do you wanna do that you surely wanna do that< that because your risk is only ninety that because your risk is only ninety dollars< dollars now dollars now of< of course we do not have that kind of of course we do not have that kind of deal< deal but the next best deal is is what deal but the next best deal is is what we< we have with leaps options because all we have with leaps options because all you're< you're doing is you're paying five you're doing is you're paying five thousand< thousand seven hundred eighty dollars thousand seven hundred eighty dollars and< and most of this is actually in and most of this is actually in intrinsic< intrinsic value which is the value of intrinsic value which is the value of the< the stock. that you're buying anyway the stock that you're buying anyway right< right and all you're doing is only right and all you're doing is only paying< paying a minuscule amount of four paying a minuscule amount of four dollars< dollars 17 cents dollars 17 cents just< just to be able to hold this position just to be able to hold this position with< with half the risk gone so i think this with half the risk gone so i think this is< is a really good deal compared to if you is a really good deal compared to if you were< were to buy at the money were to buy at the money uh< uh strikes or out of the money strikes uh strikes or out of the money strikes which< which i will definitely stay away from which i will definitely stay away from so< so the final step is to simply just so the final step is to simply just place< place the order at half price for me i place the order at half price for me i like< like to pay 50 of it so if let's say i like to pay 50 of it so if let's say i want< want to buy the stock price at 110 want to buy the stock price at 110 basically< basically i will go to the 55 strike and basically i will go to the 55 strike and then then then place< place a limit order for 55 and wait for place a limit order for 55 and wait for me< me to get fuel me to get fuel so< so this way if the stock goes to zero so this way if the stock goes to zero my< my loss max loss is only 5 500 compared my loss max loss is only 5 500 compared to< to if i was to pay the full price of uh to if i was to pay the full price of uh 108< 108 per share which is total of 10 800 108 per share which is total of 10 800 plus plus plus and< and if the stock goes to zero i would and if the stock goes to zero i would lose< lose everything lose everything all< all right guys so that's it for this all right guys so that's it for this video< video i hope it has been really helpful video i hope it has been really helpful for< for you and if you like this video for you and if you like this video please< please give me a thumbs up and please please give me a thumbs up and please subscribe< subscribe as well if you like me to subscribe as well if you like me to create< create more videos like this alright create more videos like this alright i'll<

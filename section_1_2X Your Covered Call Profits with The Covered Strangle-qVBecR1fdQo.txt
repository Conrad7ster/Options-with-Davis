### 2X Your Covered Call Profits with The Covered Strangle-qVBecR1fdQo
======================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so today's topic all right alrighty so today's topic we're< we're going to be talking about how you we're going to be talking about how you can< can 2x your covered core profits with can 2x your covered core profits with the< the covered strangle and the cover the covered strangle and the cover strangle< strangle is really a very good strategy strangle is really a very good strategy especially< especially if you intend to add on more especially if you intend to add on more positions< positions to a current stock that you positions to a current stock that you already< already own so what is the covered already own so what is the covered strangle< strangle right so the cover strangle is strangle right so the cover strangle is essentially< essentially the combination of two essentially the combination of two option< option strategies you have your covered option strategies you have your covered call< call right a cover call is essentially a call right a cover call is essentially a long< long stock position a long hundred long stock position a long hundred shares< shares and you have a short call option shares and you have a short call option against< against it and then you have a cash against it and then you have a cash secure< secure output that means that you do secure output that means that you do intend< intend to get your cash account put intend to get your cash account put assigned< assigned so that you can loan another assigned so that you can loan another 100< 100 shares so this is very different to 100 shares so this is very different to the< the naked strangle where you do not have the naked strangle where you do not have this< this long hundred shares this long hundred shares and< and as for the strangle it's more of a and as for the strangle it's more of a neutral< neutral position that means you pretty neutral position that means you pretty much< much want your stock right the much want your stock right the underlying< underlying stock to stay in between the underlying stock to stay in between the put< put and the call but for the covered put and the call but for the covered struggle< struggle because we have a long 100 struggle because we have a long 100 shares< shares position and also we do not mind shares position and also we do not mind getting< getting long another 100 shares right if getting long another 100 shares right if the< the price were to go below the cash the price were to go below the cash output< output so essentially the cover strangle output so essentially the cover strangle is< is much more of a neutral to bullish is much more of a neutral to bullish strategy< strategy all right so with the cover strategy all right so with the cover strangle< strangle it's much safer than the naked strangle it's much safer than the naked uh< uh strangle because if the stock was to uh strangle because if the stock was to suddenly< suddenly just shoot up all the way to suddenly just shoot up all the way to the< the top well in this case you wouldn't the top well in this case you wouldn't be< be that worried because you really have be that worried because you really have a< a long hard shares right you have long a long hard shares right you have long hard< hard shares and you have a cover call hard shares and you have a cover call positions< positions so in this case right you can positions so in this case right you can just< just get your just get your shares< shares called away if you want it to be shares called away if you want it to be exercised< exercised or you can just keep rolling exercised or you can just keep rolling your< your cover call up higher and higher in your cover call up higher and higher in this< this case every time when you're rolling this case every time when you're rolling it< it up out and up you're always making it up out and up you're always making more< more money because you are making more more money because you are making more on< on the intrinsic value of the long on the intrinsic value of the long hundred< hundred shares right but if you have a hundred shares right but if you have a naked< naked strangle that means you have just naked strangle that means you have just have< have a short call position and a short have a short call position and a short put< put position well every roll up here or put position well every roll up here or if< if you want to roll this up ultimately if you want to roll this up ultimately you< you want the stock to come back down to you want the stock to come back down to the< the center so that you can profit so it the center so that you can profit so it is< is a very different strategy and the is a very different strategy and the cover< cover strangle i feel is much better for cover strangle i feel is much better for a< a longer term type of trade where you a longer term type of trade where you intend< intend to hold on to this long hundred intend to hold on to this long hundred shares< shares for a long time shares for a long time so< so the covered strangle has three so the covered strangle has three sources< sources of income right so if you were sources of income right so if you were to< to just do your normal covered call to just do your normal covered call position position position right< right you would just only get the right you would just only get the premium premium premium from< from selling this cover call right from selling this cover call right but< but if you were to sell the covered but if you were to sell the covered strangle< strangle that means you were to sell strangle that means you were to sell another another another put< put option put option along< along together with your covered call along together with your covered call right< right now you have a second way for you right now you have a second way for you to< to make money right when you sell the to make money right when you sell the cash< cash output again you get some premium cash output again you get some premium for< for selling this uh put option for selling this uh put option so< so in this way you get double the so in this way you get double the profits< profits which you normally would when profits which you normally would when you< you just sell just a cover call right so you just sell just a cover call right so in< in this case because we are using the in this case because we are using the same< same days to expiration right normally same days to expiration right normally we< we use the same days to expiration the we use the same days to expiration the market< market can only expire in either of the market can only expire in either of the direction< direction right so if the market was to direction right so if the market was to go< go up here go up here right< right if you had just a covered call right if you had just a covered call position position position you'll< you'll miss out on this profit down here you'll miss out on this profit down here so< so that is why this is an additional so that is why this is an additional profit profit profit for< for your for your uh< uh covered call right so if you sell the uh covered call right so if you sell the covered< covered strangle this will expire covered strangle this will expire worthless< worthless and you receive the premium worthless and you receive the premium for< for that so if you do plan to add on to for that so if you do plan to add on to the< the position right so this covered call the position right so this covered call strangle< strangle is going to be a very good strangle is going to be a very good strategy< strategy so there's overall three income strategy so there's overall three income sources< sources the first income is by selling sources the first income is by selling the< the cover call and then you get your the cover call and then you get your premium< premium second income is by selling the premium second income is by selling the cash< cash secure output and then the third cash secure output and then the third income< income is from the intrinsic value gain income is from the intrinsic value gain the< the capital gains from the long hundred the capital gains from the long hundred shares< shares from uh the place where you shares from uh the place where you entered< entered your shares to where you sold entered your shares to where you sold the< the cover call where you're going to get the cover call where you're going to get called< called away right now of course you can called away right now of course you can keep< keep rolling this over and over again keep rolling this over and over again and< and each time as you roll it up your and each time as you roll it up your intrinsic< intrinsic value can just keep increasing intrinsic value can just keep increasing all< all right so that's the beauty of the all right so that's the beauty of the covered< covered strangle all right so when do covered strangle all right so when do you< you want to use the cover strangle so as you want to use the cover strangle so as mentioned< mentioned earlier you want to use the mentioned earlier you want to use the cover< cover strangle when you don't mind cover strangle when you don't mind owning< owning more shares of the underlying owning more shares of the underlying stock< stock so many times when we enter into a stock so many times when we enter into a position< position we do not want to enter all position we do not want to enter all that< that one goal let's say if you have five that one goal let's say if you have five thousand< thousand dollars allocated to a certain thousand dollars allocated to a certain stock< stock you definitely do not want to put stock you definitely do not want to put all< all 5 000 in one go right you want to all 5 000 in one go right you want to split< split them up to different charges right split them up to different charges right to< to different levels so you may speed to different levels so you may speed them< them up to three levels to five levels them up to three levels to five levels depending< depending on depending on how< how much capital you have for the stock how much capital you have for the stock so< so when you do it this way each time the so when you do it this way each time the market< market goes down let's say the market market goes down let's say the market keeps< keeps going down you keep averaging for keeps going down you keep averaging for a< a better price each time right rather a better price each time right rather than< than you go in all at one shot at this than you go in all at one shot at this price< price and then if the market keeps going price and then if the market keeps going down< down then you are stuck at a position down then you are stuck at a position where< where you know you have to wait for a where you know you have to wait for a long< long time before you can sell a covered long time before you can sell a covered call< call but if you just enter one position call but if you just enter one position at< at a time you can always do a covered at a time you can always do a covered strangle< strangle right you can sell a cash strangle right you can sell a cash output< output down here and then you can sell a output down here and then you can sell a covered< covered call above so this way you're covered call above so this way you're always< always trying to earn some income at the always trying to earn some income at the same< same time as the price if the price does same time as the price if the price does go< go down go down if< if the price goes down you'll be a sign if the price goes down you'll be a sign on< on cash card put this way you lower your on cash card put this way you lower your average< average price so you get a much better average price so you get a much better price< price in the long term so if you chose a price in the long term so if you chose a good< good stock this stock will eventually go good stock this stock will eventually go back< back up and you'll be able to make more back up and you'll. be able to make more money< money on the intrinsic value gain of the money on the intrinsic value gain of the song< song so this is also when you want to song so this is also when you want to add< add more shares to lower the average add more shares to lower the average cost< cost of your overall position cost of your overall position all< all right let's take a look at some all right let's take a look at some trade< trade mechanics so for the cover trade mechanics so for the cover strangle< strangle you want to be looking at strangle you want to be looking at somewhere< somewhere around 30 to 45 days to somewhere around 30 to 45 days to expiration< expiration again this is the optimal expiration again this is the optimal time< time for us to choose an expiration date time for us to choose an expiration date because< because that's when the theta decay will because that's when the theta decay will be< be at its uh most optimal point right it be at its uh most optimal point right it starts< starts to really decay more around the starts to really decay more around the 45< 45 days mark all the way down to the 45 days mark all the way down to the zero< zero mark zero mark zero< zero days to expiration next you want to zero days to expiration next you want to look< look at something around 15 20 deltas look at something around 15 20 deltas because< because this is roughly around one because this is roughly around one standard< standard deviation right once then the standard deviation right once then the deviation< deviation marks uh where the market deviation marks uh where the market would< would most of the time uh expire in would most of the time uh expire in right< right where the market uh the price right where the market uh the price would< would be in so for example would be in so for example if< if you were to sell a cover strangle if you were to sell a cover strangle with< with roughly 16 deltas each right so with roughly 16 deltas each right so this< this would basically this would basically be< be zoning out be zoning out the< the price the underlying price that the the price the underlying price that the market< market would most likely stay in between market would most likely stay in between this< this zone this zone right< right at right at expiration< expiration so in this case each time expiration so in this case each time let's< let's say it does expire inside you make let's say it does expire inside you make the< the full profits on both the cover call the full profits on both the cover call and< and the cash to cut put and this case and the cash to cut put and this case you< you can always just keep selling the you can always just keep selling the cover< cover strangle again they just keep cover strangle again they just keep collecting< collecting premium and reducing the collecting premium and reducing the overall overall overall cost< cost basis of your stock so remember cost basis of your stock so remember this< this is a covered strangle so you will this is a covered strangle so you will always< always have a hundred shares of a stock always have a hundred shares of a stock right< right now next you can take profit at 50 right now next you can take profit at 50 of< of the credit receive now this is of the credit receive now this is optional< optional right you don't really have to optional right you don't really have to do< do that so let's say if the market is do that so let's say if the market is the< the state in between uh your cover call the state in between uh your cover call and< and your cash output and during this and your cash output and during this time< time a lot of the the theta has kicked time a lot of the the theta has kicked in< in and the the he has depreciated the in and the the he has depreciated the options< options value to the point where you can options value to the point where you can take< take 50 off you can choose to do that take 50 off you can choose to do that and< and then you can reinstate the covered and then you can reinstate the covered call< call and the catch the couple again at call and the catch the couple again at the< the 16 delta points again or you could the 16 delta points again or you could just< just simply just leave it to either you just simply just leave it to either you know< know expire worthless in between or if know expire worthless in between or if it< it goes up right you can choose to close it goes up right you can choose to close uh< uh you could choose to have your shares uh you could choose to have your shares called< called away or could just roll your called away or could just roll your cover< cover call and the same place also cover call and the same place also uh< uh your cashier output right so these uh your cashier output right so these are< are the adjustments so you can roll out are the adjustments so you can roll out and< and up your covered call let's say if it and up your covered call let's say if it goes< goes above here right if it breaches goes above here right if it breaches your< your cover call you can choose to roll your cover call you can choose to roll it< it and then you can get more intrinsic it and then you can get more intrinsic value< value gain on your hundred shares or if value gain on your hundred shares or if the< the stock was to just go below your cash the stock was to just go below your cash output< output right because you already output right because you already intended< intended to get long anyway to get intended to get long anyway to get assigned< assigned another additional hundred assigned another additional hundred shares< shares you can either just leave it to shares you can either just leave it to expire< expire worthless or you could choose to expire worthless or you could choose to roll< roll it down right out and down roll it down right out and down and< and then get a better price all right and then get a better price all right for< for your cash output right better price for your cash output right better price for< for your second batch of 100 shares for your second batch of 100 shares right< right if the market continues to go right if the market continues to go lower< lower right so let's take a look at a lower right so let's take a look at a trade< trade example and i'll go through some trade example and i'll go through some scenarios< scenarios with you so you understand uh scenarios with you so you understand uh how< how to manage the covered strangle all how to manage the covered strangle all right< right so this is the stock of google so right so this is the stock of google so let's< let's say we are long 100 shares right let's say we are long 100 shares right now< now 120 dollars right let's say we are now 120 dollars right let's say we are 120 120 120 100< 100 shares so at this point of time what 100 shares so at this point of time what we< we want to do is want to sell the we want to do is want to sell the covered< covered strangle so the cover strangle covered strangle so the cover strangle is< is selling a call option and selling a is selling a call option and selling a cash< cash secured put so in this case cash secured put so in this case right< right we have chosen roughly around the right we have chosen roughly around the 16< 16 deltas so if the 16 deltas that we 16 deltas so if the 16 deltas that we chose< chose you notice is roughly about the chose you notice is roughly about the same< same distance between both of them right same distance between both of them right so< so in this case it's about 20 points up so in this case it's about 20 points up right< right 20 points up to one three zero oh right 20 points up to one three zero oh sorry< sorry ten points up from one two zero to sorry ten points up from one two zero to one< one three two is ten points up and then one three two is ten points up and then ten< ten points down to your cash output ten points down to your cash output making< making a total of 20 points of your making a total of 20 points of your covered< covered strangle right also notice that covered strangle right also notice that although< although the delta is the same right although the delta is the same right where< where you're choosing roughly around 15 where you're choosing roughly around 15 to< to 20 deltas each for the cover call and to 20 deltas each for the cover call and the< the cashier output the put option the cashier output the put option actually< actually receives more premium than the actually receives more premium than the call< call option and the reason is because call option and the reason is because there< there is put skew right if there's put there is put skew right if there's put skill< skill then you would get more premium skill then you would get more premium for< for your put option and if there's call for your put option and if there's call skill< skill you should get more for your call skill you should get more for your call option< option so push q is basically where the option so push q is basically where the volatility< volatility is higher volatility is higher on< on the put side on the put side than< than on the call side for put skill than on the call side for put skill right< right for call skill it means your right for call skill it means your volatility< volatility is higher on the call side volatility is higher on the call side than< than on the put side that is why for than on the put side that is why for options< options which have a call skill you'll options which have a call skill you'll notice< notice that the call options will be notice that the call options will be worth< worth more so in this case we are able worth more so in this case we are able to< to sell the put option more to sell the put option more because< because there is a put skill which means because there is a put skill which means the< the market determines that there is much the market determines that there is much more< more risk to the downside right so that more risk to the downside right so that is< is why they have increased the is why they have increased the volatility< volatility that normally when stocks volatility that normally when stocks fall< fall they fall faster fall they fall faster downwards< downwards right so this is the covered downwards right so this is the covered call< call the covered strangle position which call the covered strangle position which we< we have on right so let's take a look at we have on right so let's take a look at a< a few scenarios and there are three in a few scenarios and there are three in total< total so let's say for the first total so let's say for the first scenario< scenario google was to go above 130 at scenario google was to go above 130 at expiration< expiration right so if google was to go expiration right so if google was to go above< above 130 above 130 at< at expiration right it would be above at expiration right it would be above our< our cover call so what happens our cover call so what happens right< right so the covered call gets assigned right so the covered call gets assigned and< and our shares get called away at a and our shares get called away at a hundred< hundred and thirty dollars we're along hundred and thirty dollars we're along at< at 120 dollars we get our shares called at 120 dollars we get our shares called 130< 130 dollars that's ten dollars in 130 dollars that's ten dollars in intrinsic< intrinsic value game right in this case intrinsic value game right in this case we< we also uh get the profits from our cash we also uh get the profits from our cash output< output because our cash coupon now output because our cash coupon now expires< expires worthless remember they both expires worthless remember they both have< have the same expiration date so our have the same expiration date so our total< total profit would be the covered call total profit would be the covered call premium< premium which we received which is 115 premium which we received which is 115 dollars< dollars right total dollars right total okay< okay output premium is 145. our capital okay output premium is 145.

our capital gains< gains is 10 dollars since we have 100 gains is 10 dollars since we have 100 shares< shares total a thousand dollars so this shares total a thousand dollars so this gives< gives us a total profit of a thousand gives us a total profit of a thousand two< two hundred and sixty dollars right so two hundred and sixty dollars right so uh< uh a thousand two hundred sixty dollars uh a thousand two hundred sixty dollars so< so for this covered call of course right so for this covered call of course right if< if the market is to go above and you do if the market is to go above and you do not< not want your shares to be called away not want your shares to be called away you< you can always just roll your cover call you can always just roll your cover call up< up right you can roll up over and over up right you can roll up over and over again again again right< right depending on how right depending on how much< much credit you can get each time that much credit you can get each time that you< you roll and i've already covered this you roll and i've already covered this in< in my other videos where i talk about in my other videos where i talk about cover< cover call rolling so you can go ahead cover call rolling so you can go ahead and< and watch that video at my channel i put and watch that video at my channel i put a< a link right at the top right hand a link right at the top right hand corner< corner of this video but this is corner of this video but this is essentially< essentially scenario one so in our sense essentially scenario one so in our sense because< because the cover strangle is a neutral because the cover strangle is a neutral to< to bully strategy this is actually the to bully strategy this is actually the most< most favorable scenario for us because most favorable scenario for us because we< we get out of all this position with a we get out of all this position with a very< very nice profit especially where the very nice profit especially where the main< main driver of the profit is this 100 main driver of the profit is this 100 shares< shares over here all right so let's take shares over here all right so let's take a< a look at the next scenario so the next a look at the next scenario so the next scenario< scenario is if google is in between 110 scenario is if google is in between 110 and< and 130 dollars that means it stays in and 130 dollars that means it stays in between< between uh the covered strangle between uh the covered strangle range< range right so it it stays in within range right so it it stays in within here< here so what happens if it stays in here so what happens if it stays in within< within here at expiration within here at expiration well< well if it stays in within the uh well if it stays in within the uh covered< covered call and the cash output covered call and the cash output expiration< expiration then our cover call expires expiration then our cover call expires worthless< worthless so we receive the full premium worthless so we receive the full premium through< through that the cash output also through that the cash output also expires< expires worthless again we receive the expires worthless again we receive the full< full premium so in this case because we full premium so in this case because we still< still have our 100 shares right still have our 100 shares right depending< depending on where it is right if it's depending on where it is right if it's above< above down here above where our entry above down here above where our entry price< price is then we have a slight profit on price is then we have a slight profit on our< our shares but we're still holding on to our shares but we're still holding on to it< it if it drops below our entry price it if it drops below our entry price then< then there will be a slight drawdown then there will be a slight drawdown right right right so< so in this case our profit would just so in this case our profit would just mainly< mainly come from selling the two uh mainly come from selling the two uh short< short options right the short call and short options right the short call and the< the short put so in this case our the short put so in this case our premium< premium would just be simply what we premium would just be simply what we collected< collected the profits will be just what collected the profits will be just what we< we collected from the premium which is we collected from the premium which is 115< 115 plus 145 that gives us 260 dollars 115 plus 145 that gives us 260 dollars now< now what do we do after the option has now what do we do after the option has expired< expired worthless right so let's say expired worthless right so let's say yeah< yeah that's expired worthless at this yeah that's expired worthless at this point< point of time point of time if< if the market let's say is somewhere if the market let's say is somewhere around< around 126 dollars let's say this is the around 126 dollars let's say this is the price< price mark where the market price mark where the market expired<. expired at so in this case you can expired at so in this case you can actually< actually just sell another covered call actually just sell another covered call maybe< maybe you can sell 130 or you could sell maybe you can sell 130 or you could sell a< a 16 delta and then you get a higher a 16 delta and then you get a higher covered< covered call price right in this case do covered call price right in this case do you< you want to sell the cash output you you want to sell the cash output you could< could you could sell the cash a couple could you could sell the cash a couple but< but bear in mind if you sell the cash but bear in mind if you sell the cash secure< secure output your 16 deltas will now be secure output your 16 deltas will now be slightly< slightly closer to where your previous slightly closer to where your previous entry< entry price of the hundred shares is entry price of the hundred shares is right< right so let's say if you choose um right so let's say if you choose um a< a 16 delta so this should be an a 16 delta so this should be an equidistance< equidistance from this price down here equidistance from this price down here to< to all the way up here this should be to all the way up here this should be equidistant< equidistant because it's both roughly 16 equidistant because it's both roughly 16 deltas< deltas each 15 to 20 deltas right the deltas each 15 to 20 deltas right the thing< thing is that your cash you can put thing is that your cash you can put right< right now will be much closer right now will be much closer to< to your entry price for the hundred to your entry price for the hundred shares< shares now whether you want to sell this shares now whether you want to sell this here< here or not is really a decision you here or not is really a decision you have< have to make right i would rather not have to make right i would rather not sell< sell this because if i do want to sell this because if i do want to average< average in add more shares i do want a average in add more shares i do want a lower< lower entry price i would prefer to have lower entry price i would prefer to have my< my cash outputs stay at the same price my cash outputs stay at the same price which< which i sold previously but if i were to which i sold previously but if i were to sell< sell it right now chances are that i sell it right now chances are that i would< would not be able to get a higher would not be able to get a higher premium premium premium than< than what i did previously because right than what i did previously because right now< now it's further out the money so in my now it's further out the money so in my case< case i would probably just wait i would case i would probably just wait i would just< just sell the cover call first just sell the cover call first and< and if the price subsequently dropped to and if the price subsequently dropped to a< a point where i can sell the cover call a point where i can sell the cover call i< i will sell the cover call again so in i will sell the cover call again so in this< this case right now if i was to wait for this case right now if i was to wait for the< the price to drop before i sell uh cash the price to drop before i sell uh cash output< output you'll see right now that the the output you'll see right now that the the distance< distance between the cover call and the distance between the cover call and the cash< cash capital is right now bigger right cash capital is right now bigger right that< that means you have now have a wider that means you have now have a wider covered< covered strangle which helps you covered strangle which helps you increase< increase the profit or increase the the increase the profit or increase the the probability< probability of profit of your covered probability of profit of your covered strangle< strangle that means it eat strangle that means it eat leaning< leaning in between these two zone all leaning in between these two zone all right< right so at the end of the day it is up right so at the end of the day it is up to< to you to decide now what if the price to you to decide now what if the price actually< actually is somewhere down here instead actually is somewhere down here instead right< right if the price is uh expires around right if the price is uh expires around 114< 114 this price which is below our entry 114 this price which is below our entry price< price right in this case i would rather price right in this case i would rather just< just sell a cashier output at 16 delta just sell a cashier output at 16 delta and< and get a lower price right and get a lower price right also< also i'll catch a cut put down here also i'll catch a cut put down here probably< probably i'll get roughly the same probably i'll get roughly the same premium< premium which i sold previously which i premium which i sold previously which i got< got at 1. 45 cents selling at a roughly got at 1.

45 cents selling at a roughly 15< 15 to 20 deltas again and and then 15 to 20 deltas again and and then similarly< similarly right i do not want to sell a similarly right i do not want to sell a covered< covered call right now because if i were covered call right now because if i were to<. to sell a cover call right now chances to sell a cover call right now chances are< are that i might only be able to sell it are that i might only be able to sell it somewhere< somewhere around here for a 16 dollars somewhere around here for a 16 dollars right< right to get roughly the same 1. 50 this right to get roughly the same 1.

=====================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about how to we're going to be talking about how to manage< manage huge losing positions so huge manage huge losing positions so huge losing< losing positions may be something like losing positions may be something like this< this right so you can see Tesla down this right so you can see Tesla down here< here is losing about 116 here is losing about 116 000< 000 on the shares so this is a big six 000 on the shares so this is a big six figure< figure loss and also you do have you figure loss and also you do have you know< know a loss down here on the put options know a loss down here on the put options about< about three thousand over dollars so about three thousand over dollars so first< first of all this is not my account I do first of all this is not my account I do not< not buy Tesla shares I'm not into Tesla not buy Tesla shares I'm not into Tesla and< and I do even trade Tesla options as and I do even trade Tesla options as well< well so this account is actually from well so this account is actually from one< one of my subscribers so he has reached one of my subscribers so he has reached out< out to me asking for help to see whether out to me asking for help to see whether there's< there's any way to salvage his positions there's any way to salvage his positions so< so we'll be looking at this positions so we'll be looking at this positions later< later on and then to see whether there's later on and then to see whether there's anything< anything that can be done to salvage his anything that can be done to salvage his positions< positions maybe to make things a little positions maybe to make things a little bit< bit better so maybe if you have losing bit better so maybe if you have losing positions< positions as well maybe not as big as positions as well maybe not as big as this< this you can still use this video you this you can still use this video you know< know as a guideline to see you know what know as a guideline to see you know what are< are the options that you can take so are the options that you can take so first< first of all before we get into that first of all before we get into that first< first thing we need to understand is how first thing we need to understand is how losing< losing positions actually come about so losing positions actually come about so if< if you trade long enough inevitably if you trade long enough inevitably there< there will be times where you will have there will be times where you will have a< a huge losing position and they usually a huge losing position and they usually happen< happen due to one of the following happen due to one of the following reasons< reasons right so the very first reason reasons right so the very first reason is< is maybe your size is too big right this is maybe your size is too big right this is< is one of the very classic reason that is one of the very classic reason that most< most new Traders actually get into most new Traders actually get into trouble< trouble is because they have too big a trouble is because they have too big a size< size so you never want to allocate a size so you never want to allocate a very< very huge percentage of your account to very huge percentage of your account to any< any one trade because if you do that any one trade because if you do that then< then you're at risk of blowing up your then you're at risk of blowing up your account< account just you know in one trade so account just you know in one trade so the< the next reason that you might have a the next reason that you might have a huge< huge loss is maybe you turn a defined huge loss is maybe you turn a defined risk< risk strategy into an undefined risk risk strategy into an undefined risk strategy< strategy so maybe you turn the blue put strategy so maybe you turn the blue put spread< spread into a short put so for example spread into a short put so for example this< this is the stock price down here so as this is the stock price down here so as it's< it's coming down you are going to be it's coming down you are going to be bullish< bullish on this so maybe you want to bullish on this so maybe you want to sell< sell a bull put spread right so you're sell a bull put spread right so you're selling< selling out of money put option and then selling out of money put option and then you< you buy a further out of the money put you buy a further out of the money put option< option so for this boo-boo spread your option so for this boo-boo spread your maximum< maximum loss is actually defined find to maximum loss is actually defined find to the< the width of this spread right so let's the width of this spread right so let's say< say for example this spread the maximum say for example this spread the maximum loss< loss let's say it's 500 right so even loss let's say it's 500 right so even though< though if the stock right let's say it though if the stock right let's say it blows< blows through all of these strikes which blows through all of these strikes which you< you have down here the most you can lose you have down here the most you can lose is< is only 500 but the problem is that some is only 500 but the problem is that some people< people do not want to realize this loss people do not want to realize this loss at< at all right as much as possible maybe at all right as much as possible maybe they< they just want to make a winner right they just want to make a winner right they< they just want to make money so what they just want to make money so what they< they do is they turn this into a shot they do is they turn this into a shot put< put so to turn this into short put what put so to turn this into short put what they< they do is they sell off this long put they do is they sell off this long put portion< portion because when the market actually portion because when the market actually goes< goes past this long put this Long Point goes past this long put this Long Point will< will be in a profit will be very will be in a profit will be very profitable< profitable so they will sell this away profitable so they will sell this away and< and then for this shot put right it will and then for this shot put right it will be< be in a huge loss right the losses will be in a huge loss right the losses will be< be bigger than this profit that you made be bigger than this profit that you made so< so they do not want to realize this loss so they do not want to realize this loss what< what they do is that they just roll it what they do is that they just roll it out< out and down right so they just keep out and down right so they just keep rolling< rolling this So eventually let's say for rolling this So eventually let's say for example< example if the market does rally again example if the market does rally again then< then they will make on both ends right then they will make on both ends right because< because this shot put could expire out because this shot put could expire out of< of the money and then they get uh all of the money and then they get uh all the< the premiums. which they have received the premiums which they have received even< even after all the rolling and then they even after all the rolling and then they already< already made profit on this so they already made profit on this so they pretty< pretty much make money on both sides but pretty much make money on both sides but the< the problem with this method is that the problem with this method is that what< what if the market does not recover what if the market does not recover right< right what if the stock continues to go right what if the stock continues to go all< all the way down and if it continues to all the way down and if it continues to go< go all the way down then guess what this go all the way down then guess what this 500< 500 Max loss is no longer in place right 500 Max loss is no longer in place right you< you will now lose much more than this you will now lose much more than this 500< 500 because now this is a naked put 500 because now this is a naked put right< right so if the market really crashes right so if the market really crashes then< then this Max loss can go even bigger so then this Max loss can go even bigger so as< as much as possible never turn a defined as much as possible never turn a defined risk< risk strategy in into an undefined risk risk strategy in into an undefined risk strategy< strategy if you put it on as a defined strategy if you put it on as a defined risk< risk strategy then exit as a defined risk strategy then exit as a defined risk< risk strategy now the third reason that risk strategy now the third reason that you< you might experience a huge loss is if you might experience a huge loss is if you< you didn't want to take a loss so you you didn't want to take a loss so you just< just keep rolling and adjusting and just keep rolling and adjusting and holding< holding on to the trade right so maybe holding on to the trade right so maybe if< if you have a shot put on and let's say if you have a shot put on and let's say for< for example the price has blown through for example the price has blown through your< your strike price so instead of maybe your strike price so instead of maybe taking< taking a loss you want to adjust it and taking a loss you want to adjust it and then< then you you just roll down so rolling then you you just roll down so rolling down< down is not really an issue by itself down is not really an issue by itself but< but the problem is that there must be a but the problem is that there must be a point< point whereby you decide to cut loss point whereby you decide to cut loss right< right because if the market just keeps right because if the market just keeps going< going all the way down no matter how you going all the way down no matter how you roll< roll it will still forever be in a loss roll it will still forever be in a loss and< and as you keep rolling and if the and as you keep rolling and if the market< market keeps going down then your losses market keeps going down then your losses are< are actually getting bigger and bigger are actually getting bigger and bigger and< and bigger so this is one of the big and bigger so this is one of the big risks< risks you have when you're actually risks you have when you're actually rolling< rolling the stock down so the last rolling the stock down so the last reason< reason that you may have a big loss is reason that you may have a big loss is maybe< maybe you didn't have a plan to manage maybe you didn't have a plan to manage losers< losers from the start or you didn't losers from the start or you didn't stick< stick with your plan so what you need to stick with your plan so what you need to understand< understand is that no matter what kind understand is that no matter what kind of< of strategy you put on there will always of strategy you put on there will always be< be a probability that it can lose money be a probability that it can lose money so< so if there's a loss you do want to just so if there's a loss you do want to just take< take the loss when it's time to take the take the loss when it's time to take the loss< loss so this four things you can loss so this four things you can actually< actually control right if your size is actually control right if your size is too< too big all you have to do is just too big all you have to do is just reduce< reduce your size if you put it on as a reduce your size if you put it on as a defined< defined risk strategy then do not turn defined risk strategy then do not turn it< it into an undefining strategy just keep it into an undefining strategy just keep it< it as that and exit as you define reach it as that and exit as you define reach strategy< strategy and if you do want to take a strategy and if you do want to take a loss< loss so you keep rolling and rolling loss so you keep rolling and rolling well< well you need to know what is where is well you need to know what is where is the< the point where you need to take a loss the point where you need to take a loss and< and then you can just take the loss and and then you can just take the loss and if< if you didn't have a plan to manage if you didn't have a plan to manage losers< losers from the start or you didn't losers from the start or you didn't stick< stick your plan then again that is on stick your plan then again that is on you< you because all this you have full you because all this you have full control< control of so when you prevent all this control of so when you prevent all this from< from happening then your chances of from happening then your chances of having< having a huge loss diminishes all right having a huge loss diminishes all right so< so let's get into this email which my so let's get into this email which my subscriber< subscriber has uh sent me so he has subscriber has uh sent me so he has emailed< emailed me saying he needs help so emailed me saying he needs help so

explain< explain in gen 24. so these five lots of explain in gen 24.

so these five lots of soap< soap puts were wrote during the 2022 soap puts were wrote during the 2022 Tesla< Tesla 70 decline to January 24th so you Tesla 70 decline to January 24th so you can< can see 70 decline is very huge so any can see 70 decline is very huge so any bullish< bullish positions will definitely be hit bullish positions will definitely be hit so< so let's take a look at this position so let's take a look at this position all< all right so the position I believe that all right so the position I believe that he's< he's talking about are these two put he's talking about are these two put options< options down here by the way if you like options down here by the way if you like this< this video. so far Please Subscribe and this video so far Please Subscribe and also< also click the thumbs up button and also also click the thumbs up button and also do< do get your free copy of the options do get your free copy of the options income< income blueprint where I share the top income blueprint where I share the top three< three options strategies that help you three options strategies that help you generate< generate a consistent income each month generate a consistent income each month trading< trading just one to two hours a day trading just one to two hours a day right< right so if you want to go ahead to get right so if you want to go ahead to get this< this copy just head on over to this copy just head on over to optionswithdavis. com< optionswithdavis.

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video so you can see it's a back to the video so you can see it's a total< total of five Lots right so what he said total of five Lots right so what he said down< down here is that he has just kept down here is that he has just kept rolling< rolling this five lots of soap puts rolling this five lots of soap puts right< right during the 2022 decline right 70 right during the 2022 decline right 70 decline< decline so all he did is he just kept decline so all he did is he just kept rolling< rolling out and down most likely I'm not rolling out and down most likely I'm not sure< sure whether he wrote down most likely sure whether he wrote down most likely he< he wrote out that's for sure right he wrote out that's for sure right because< because now it's all the way in January because now it's all the way in January 24< 24 so that is a long way out as of this 24 so that is a long way out as of this time< time of recording right so it means time of recording right so it means about< about a year or so left right so you can about a year or so left right so you can see< see down here this is a plus right 8006 see down here this is a plus right 8006 2066< 2066 and this is a loss of 3 200 odd 2066 and this is a loss of 3 200 odd dollars< dollars right so overall it's like a dollars right so overall it's like a positive< positive but this is misleading right positive but this is misleading right because< because this is not likely the true because this is not likely the true profits< profits of his disposition because he profits. of his disposition because he has< has said that he has kept rolling so has said that he has kept rolling so when< when you roll a position basically you when you roll a position basically you are< are closing out the initial position and are closing out the initial position and then< then putting on a new position so when then putting on a new position so when you< you close out the O position while the p you close out the O position while the p l< l has already been realized and then you l has already been realized and then you put< put on a new position so in this case put on a new position so in this case although< although you see a profit down here although you see a profit down here chances< chances are this position has already chances are this position has already been< been rolled many times and is probably been rolled many times and is probably in< in a pretty big loss right these two in a pretty big loss right these two positions< positions combined could be a very big positions combined could be a very big loss< loss because he did mention he wrote loss because he did mention he wrote this< this right during the 70 decline this right during the 70 decline so< so as you can see from here as well uh so as you can see from here as well uh I'm< I'm not familiar with this platform I'm I'm not familiar with this platform I'm not< not sure what platform this is but I not sure what platform this is but I think< think this could be his cost price right think this could be his cost price right so< so it says down here last and cost so so it says down here last and cost so its< its cost price is around 300 it's 297.

its cost price is around 300 it's 297. so< so chances are that he may have sold his so chances are that he may have sold his put< put option sometime around that that put option sometime around that that time< time right and then he started to roll time right and then he started to roll down< down so if you roll down during that down so if you roll down during that time< time chances are these are going to be time chances are these are going to be pretty< pretty big losers so the very first pretty big losers so the very first thing< thing uh when I take a look at this thing uh when I take a look at this position< position that I need to know right which position that I need to know right which is< is not clear here is whether this shot is not clear here is whether this shot put< put positions are they meant to be a put positions are they meant to be a cash< cash account put or is it a naked put cash account put or is it a naked put right< right because cashier output and naked right because cashier output and naked puts< puts are two very different strategies puts are two very different strategies right< right cash check output just means that right cash check output just means that you< you already have the cash that you're you already have the cash that you're prepared< prepared to get assigned on for the prepared to get assigned on for the strike< strike price to get long the underlying strike price to get long the underlying shares< shares right the underlying stock so shares right the underlying stock so let's< let's say for example there's two lots let's say for example there's two lots here< here that means to say you already have here that means to say you already have the< the cash to loan 200 shares at this the cash to loan 200 shares at this strike< strike price of 193 and you also have strike price of 193 and you also have the< the cash for 300 the shares to be the cash for 300 the shares to be assigned< assigned at 213 for this option all assigned at 213 for this option all right< right so let's say for example it is a right so let's say for example it is a cash< cash check output so if you already have cash check output so if you already have the< the cash ready you're ready to get the cash ready you're ready to get assigned< assigned the strike price then actually assigned the strike price then actually it's< it's not so bad right because chances it's not so bad right because chances are< are if you are you know if you put on a are if you are you know if you put on a cash< cash check output it means you just want cash check output it means you just want to< to buy shares and then you're willing to to buy shares and then you're willing to just< just hold on to it maybe for the long just hold on to it maybe for the long term< term so the question now becomes to you term so the question now becomes to you know< know whether are you still bullish on know whether are you still bullish on Tesla< Tesla right I have no view on Tesla I Tesla right I have no view on Tesla I stay< stay away from the stock but if you stay away from the stock but if you still< still think that it's bullish you think still think that it's bullish you think is< is that it's going to go up in a in the is that it's going to go up in a in the long< long term then this cash check output long term then this cash check output what< what you can do is you can wait until what you can do is you can wait until it's< it's close to expiration and provided it's close to expiration and provided you< you are not assigned on it already right you are not assigned on it already right if< if you're not assigned on it then you if you're not assigned on it then you can< can actually just roll it again maybe can actually just roll it again maybe just< just roll it down and just get more just roll it down and just get more extensive< extensive value and keep you know just extensive value and keep you know just lowering< lowering your cost basis that is if it's lowering your cost basis that is if it's a< a cash secure output that means you a cash secure output that means you already< already have the cash that means any already have the cash that means any decline< decline in the stock price doesn't decline in the stock price doesn't really< really affect you that much because you really affect you that much because you do< do have the cash to fulfill all this you do have the cash to fulfill all this you know< know shares in case you do get a sign know shares in case you do get a sign right< right because I assume the reason you right because I assume the reason you sold< sold the put in the first place is sold the put in the first place is because< because you want to get long the stock because you want to get long the stock right< right that's if it is a cash secure right that's if it is a cash secure output< output now what if it's meant to be a output now what if it's meant to be a naked< naked pool right what is meant to be a naked pool right what is meant to be a naked< naked shot put then it's going to be a naked shot put then it's going to be a little< little bit much more Troublesome because little bit much more Troublesome because it< it means that you most likely do not it means that you most likely do not have< have the cash to fulfill on the shares have the cash to fulfill on the shares if< if you get a sign right so this is going if you get a sign right so this is going to< to be a little bit problem because if to be a little bit problem because if the< the market goes even further down all the market goes even further down all right< right if it goes much further down you right if it goes much further down you do< do have the cash then it's possible that do have the cash then it's possible that you< you could get into a margin call whereby you could get into a margin call whereby the< the broker will require you to actually the broker will require you to actually put< put up more funds into your account and put up more funds into your account and if< if you don't put up the funds then the if you don't put up the funds then the broker< broker will most likely just liquidate broker will most likely just liquidate your< your position for a loss at that point your position for a loss at that point right< right so this is going to be pretty right so this is going to be pretty troublesome troublesome troublesome and< and to be frank with you it's going to and to be frank with you it's going to be< be quite hard to rectify as well be quite hard to rectify as well especially< especially since you've already rolled especially since you've already rolled it< it until so far out right that's still it until so far out right that's still like< like 300 days so I take a look at your like 300 days so I take a look at your options< options which you have so this is the options which you have so this is the January< January 24 which you have down here so January 24 which you have down here so it's< it's about 300 days out so the silver it's about 300 days out so the silver lining< lining in the cloud or the slight good lining in the cloud or the slight good news< news down here is that your Deltas are news down here is that your Deltas are not< not that high right so your Delta is not that high right so your Delta is down< down here for the 193 strike is 38 down here for the 193 strike is 38 Deltas< Deltas this is 46 Deltas for the 213 so Deltas this is 46 Deltas for the 213 so it< it is actually still pretty manageable it is actually still pretty manageable in< in a sense whereby if the stock was to in a sense whereby if the stock was to move< move against you a dollar this option is move against you a dollar this option is not< not going to lose that much right as not going to lose that much right as compared< compared to if you had a dip in the compared to if you had a dip in the money< money put option right if your Delta was money put option right if your Delta was around< around 80 or 90 then there will be quite around 80 or 90 then there will be quite Troublesome< Troublesome because your p l string will Troublesome because your p l string will be< be very high right so I think what you be very high right so I think what you have< have done so far is that you have just have done so far is that you have just kept< kept rolling out maybe you have wrote kept rolling out maybe you have wrote down< down as well as whenever you can to try down as well as whenever you can to try and< and soften this Delta so any adverse and soften this Delta so any adverse movement< movement in the stock as long as Tesla movement in the stock as long as Tesla goes< goes down the loss which you take in goes down the loss which you take in your< your account is not as big not as heavy your account is not as big not as heavy so< so you have pretty much softened the so you have pretty much softened the Deltas< Deltas down here which is the good thing Deltas down here which is the good thing now< now the other thing or rather the not so now the other thing or rather the not so good< good news is that maybe you already good news is that maybe you already don't< don't really have that funds in your don't really have that funds in your account< account right so that means if the account right so that means if the market< market was due to continue drop a little market was due to continue drop a little bit< bit further then it could deep pass your bit further then it could deep pass your cash< cash balance if you did bus dips past cash balance if you did bus dips past your< your cash balance then you're in danger your cash balance then you're in danger of< of a margin call if you don't top up all of a margin call if you don't top up all right< right and each day you're holding on to right and each day you're holding on to this< this position and you're using the this position and you're using the broker< broker spawning let's say you are on broker spawning let's say you are on margin< margin already then you will also be margin already then you will also be incurring< incurring financing charges the margin incurring financing charges the margin rates< rates which is pretty high right so rates which is pretty high right so you'll< you'll be compounding losses upon losses you'll be compounding losses upon losses if< if Tesla keeps dropping so whenever you if Tesla keeps dropping so whenever you have< have a position on a sharper position on have a position on a sharper position on and< and it's in the money there are pretty and it's in the money there are pretty much< much three options that you can choose much three options that you can choose right< right three choices so the first is by right three choices so the first is by reducing< reducing your Delta by Rolling which is reducing your Delta by Rolling which is what< what you have already done and you have what you have already done and you have by< by this time you have already rolled all by this time you have already rolled all the< the way to 300 days out generally the way to 300 days out generally rolling< rolling so far up is not that favorable rolling so far up is not that favorable right< right but you have already ruled until right but you have already ruled until this< this point so reducing uh to the Delta this point so reducing uh to the Delta by< by Rolling maybe you might want to wait by Rolling maybe you might want to wait a< a little bit longer until maybe there's a little bit longer until maybe there's left< left 60 days or so maybe 30 days and left 60 days or so maybe 30 days and provided< provided you're not assigned during that provided you're not assigned during that time< time then you could probably try and time then you could probably try and roll< roll again okay but other than that I roll again okay but other than that I don't< don't think you can do any more rolling don't think you can do any more rolling now< now the next thing it would be to pretty now the next thing it would be to pretty much< much do nothing right at this point I much do nothing right at this point I don't< don't think this may be the favorable don't think this may be the favorable thing< thing because right now you have a thing because right now you have a pretty< pretty big position on and let's say for pretty big position on and let's say for example< example it truly is a naked pool that example it truly is a naked pool that means< means you don't have the cash and if the means you don't have the cash and if the market< market still continues to drop if Tesla market still continues to drop if Tesla still< still continues to drop then you are still continues to drop then you are going< going to possibly hit Margin Call right going to possibly hit Margin Call right you're< you're possibly going to hit Margin Call you're possibly going to hit Margin Call so< so doing nothing I don't think is a very so doing nothing I don't think is a very good< good choice considering the fact that good choice considering the fact that you< you may actually you know deep pass your you may actually you know deep pass your cash< cash balance so it will come down to the cash balance so it will come down to the third< third choice which I know could be very third choice which I know could be very difficult< difficult to do because difficult to do because you< you know who likes to take a loss right you know who likes to take a loss right and< and this really reminds me of one of the and this really reminds me of one of the videos< videos I created where I shared with you videos I created where I shared with you one< one of my friends who entered into a one of my friends who entered into a baba< baba trade he sold many short options as baba trade he sold many short options as well< well many put options thinking that the well many put options thinking that the price< price won't drop and then it really did price won't drop and then it really did and< and it blew past all his short put and it blew past all his short put strikes< strikes and then in the end he came to strikes and then in the end he came to me< me for help as well and I told him the me for help as well and I told him the only< only thing that he can do is either to only thing that he can do is either to take< take loss or just reduce the size right take loss or just reduce the size right so< so in this case you need to reduce the so in this case you need to reduce the size< size if you no longer have the cash on size if you no longer have the cash on right< right so you have no choice but to right so you have no choice but to reduce< reduce the size that means you need to reduce the size that means you need to take< take a loss on some of the positions take a loss on some of. the positions that's< that's that's the best thing that you that's that's the best thing that you can< can do now to prevent your account from can do now to prevent your account from going< going further deeper into the raid or going further deeper into the raid or you< you may want to consider just cutting you may want to consider just cutting loss< loss totally and then just put on other loss totally and then just put on other trades< trades by then so I wish I had a better trades by then so I wish I had a better kind< kind of a way to salvage your positions kind of a way to salvage your positions but< but pretty much this is all the things but pretty much this is all the things that< that you can pretty much do right this that you can pretty much do right this is< is all the things where this person can is all the things where this person can do< do at this point in time the next thing do at this point in time the next thing I< I want to really talk about is how to I want to really talk about is how to avoid< avoid such huge losing percentage avoid such huge losing percentage Because< Because by the time you actually reach Because by the time you actually reach such< such big losses right reach such big such big losses right reach such big losses< losses it could pretty much be a little losses it could pretty much be a little bit< bit too late to do anything so the way bit too late to do anything so the way to< to not get into such huge losing to not get into such huge losing positions< positions in the first place is to have positions in the first place is to have some< some sort of prevention you know measure some sort of prevention you know measure or< or sort of prevention control in the or sort of prevention control in the first< first place right to avoid such huge first place right to avoid such huge losing< losing positions so there are a few losing positions so there are a few things< things that you can do for this so first things that you can do for this so first of< of all you want to trade small right of all you want to trade small right when< when you trade small you ensure that no when you trade small you ensure that no one< one position is going to take a big hit one position is going to take a big hit on< on your account right so trades more and on your account right so trades more and that< that means to allocate no more than five that means to allocate no more than five to< to seven percent of your capital on any to seven percent of your capital on any single< single trade and if you're using single trade and if you're using undefined< undefined risk trades let's say for undefined risk trades let's say for example< example like the shot put position then example like the shot put position then this< this five to seven percent would be on this five to seven percent would be on your< your buying power requirement right your your buying power requirement right your buying< buying power effect so if you see the buying power effect so if you see the buying< buying power for this shot put let's say buying power for this shot put let's say for< for example it's maybe five thousand for example it's maybe five thousand dollars< dollars right let's say for example it's dollars right let's say for example it's 5< 5 thousand dollars that means you need 5 thousand dollars that means you need to< to allocate five to seven percent to fit to allocate five to seven percent to fit this< this number down here so let's say five this number down here so let's say five percent< percent which means to say your account percent which means to say your account size< size has to be at least a hundred size has to be at least a hundred thousand< thousand dollars if your account size is thousand dollars if your account size is not< not a hundred thousand dollars then put not a hundred thousand dollars then put it< it on this would be a little bit too big it on this would be a little bit too big let's< let's see if you have a 25k account let's see if you have a 25k account right< right if you have a 25k account and then right if you have a 25k account and then you< you want to put on this shot put let's you want to put on this shot put let's say< say for example the buying power effect say for example the buying power effect is< is five thousand dollars then guess what is five thousand dollars then guess what this< this is way too big it is much too big this is way too big it is much too big for< for your account because that's like for your account because that's like what< what twenty percent so that is why you what twenty percent so that is why you always< always want to ensure that the capital always want to ensure that the capital allocation< allocation right it fits the account allocation right it fits the account size< size right the whatever you're size right the whatever you're allocating< allocating to it the risk fits your allocating to it the risk fits your account< account size so in this case if you're account size so in this case if you're twenty< twenty five thousand dollars account twenty five thousand dollars account there's< there's no way you can put on this trade there's no way you can put on this trade you< you want to find smaller uh price stocks you want to find smaller uh price stocks those< those uh stocks where it's not as those uh stocks where it's not as expensive< expensive or index ETFs that's not as expensive or index ETFs that's not as expensive< expensive all right next thing is to expensive all right next thing is to trade< trade index ETFs instead of individual trade index ETFs instead of individual stocks< stocks because because we already know stocks because because we already know individual< individual stocks are much more volatile individual stocks are much more volatile and< and they are prone to additional risks and they are prone to additional risks on< on top of Market risk which is on top of Market risk which is individual< individual stock risk all right like for individual stock risk all right like for example< example if Tesla I think that time Tesla example if Tesla I think that time Tesla Elon< Elon Musk came out to say they're going Elon Musk came out to say they're going to< to buy Twitter and then there's a lot of to buy Twitter and then there's a lot of hoo-ha< hoo-ha going on where he want to buy hoo-ha going on where he want to buy then< then he decided not to buy then he want then he decided not to buy then he want to< to buy again and then there's a whole to buy again and then there's a whole roller< roller coaster ride right so when he roller coaster ride right so when he decided< decided to in the end go ahead with the decided to in the end go ahead with the purchase< purchase guess where the money is going purchase guess where the money is going to< to come from right it's definitely going to come from right it's definitely going to< to come from selling his shares in Tesla to come from selling his shares in Tesla right< right so the Tesla shareholders right so the Tesla shareholders personally< personally didn't like it and that's personally didn't like it and that's where< where a big decline in the shares came where a big decline in the shares came in< in the stock came in the stock came right< right as well as when you trade right as well as when you trade individual< individual stocks there's also earnings individual stocks there's also earnings right< right earnings can have very big right earnings can have very big movements< movements as well so if you want to movements as well so if you want to reduce< reduce the chance of a huge outlier risk reduce the chance of a huge outlier risk move< move then you want to choose to trade move then you want to choose to trade index< index ETS because index ETFs don't have index ETS because index ETFs don't have any< any of those Shenanigans right there is any of those Shenanigans right there is no< no earnings there's no individual stocks no earnings there's no individual stocks uh< uh news that can affect the index uh news that can affect the index because< because usually it's a basket of many because usually it's a basket of many many< many stocks so index ETFs such as like many stocks so index ETFs such as like the< the spiders iwm the qqqs like that now the spiders iwm the qqqs like that now next< next you want to diversify by bullish next you want to diversify by bullish bearish< bearish and neutral strategies because bearish and neutral strategies because when< when you have a mixture of different when you have a mixture of different strategies< strategies then depending on how the strategies then depending on how the market< market moves right some of it will make market moves right some of it will make money< money some of it will lose money so what money some of it will lose money so what it< it does is that it kind of smoothen out it does is that it kind of smoothen out your< your p l volatility so let's say for your p l volatility so let's say for example< example if the market crashes well on example if the market crashes well on your< your bullish trade you'll definitely your bullish trade you'll definitely lose< lose money right your bearish trade you lose money right your bearish trade you will< will make money your neutral trade will make money your neutral trade depending< depending on you know how wide are your depending on you know how wide are your strikes< strikes maybe you may make a little bit strikes maybe you may make a little bit of< of money right make a little bit of of money right make a little bit of money< money me so all in all at least your money me so all in all at least your loss< loss if it is a loss it's not that big loss if it is a loss it's not that big because< because you have all this position so because you have all this position so it's< it's important to diversify by the it's important to diversify by the different< different strategies now next is different strategies now next is something< something that you definitely do not something that you definitely do not want< want to do and that is to turn a defined want to do and that is to turn a defined risk< risk strategy into an undefined risk risk strategy into an undefined risk strategy< strategy as mentioned as much as strategy as mentioned as much as possible< possible always close out your trade as possible always close out your trade as the< the trade that you put it on especially the trade that you put it on especially if< if it's a defined risk strategy and if it's a defined risk strategy and finally< finally and the most important thing is finally and the most important thing is always< always have an exit plan especially for always have an exit plan especially for when< when to take a loss right so this is one when to take a loss right so this is one of< of the things that I noticed that not a of the things that I noticed that not a lot< lot of Traders a lot of new Traders lot of Traders a lot of new Traders actually< actually do right because whenever they actually do right because whenever they enter< enter into a trade they roughly only see enter into a trade they roughly only see the< the premium that they can make right the premium that they can make right everybody< everybody is lit up by the money that everybody is lit up by the money that they< they can make but what I learned in my they can make but what I learned in my prop< prop trading days is that risk is very prop trading days is that risk is very important< important you need to manage risk important you need to manage risk because< because you don't they're gonna kick you because you don't they're gonna kick you out< out right they're going to fire you on out right they're going to fire you on the< the spot as many of those Traders I the spot as many of those Traders I mentioned< mentioned about in our video they got mentioned about in our video they got fired< fired on the spot for not managing their fired on the spot for not managing their risk< risk well so now that you're trading risk well so now that you're trading your< your own money all the more you need to your own money all the more you need to be< be more disciplined to take a loss when be more disciplined to take a loss when there< there is because there will always be there is because there will always be losses< losses regardless of what kind of losses regardless of what kind of strategy< strategy you put on so let's say for strategy you put on so let's say for example< example you put on a shot put like this example you put on a shot put like this right< right let's say for example you put on right let's say for example you put on the< the 30 Delta shot for it so 30 Delta the 30 Delta shot for it so 30 Delta would< would roughly mean a 70 probability of would roughly mean a 70 probability of profit< profit right that means you have a 70 profit right that means you have a 70 chance< chance of win so although you have a 70 chance of win so although you have a 70 chance< chance of win what it also means is that chance of win what it also means is that there< there is a 30 chance that you will there is a 30 chance that you will actually< actually lose money right that it will actually lose money right that it will be< be a possible loss so when those 30 come be a possible loss so when those 30 come you< you want to take it so that the loss is you want to take it so that the loss is actually< actually manageable the last thing you actually manageable the last thing you want< want is to turn this loss into an even want is to turn this loss into an even bigger< bigger loss and into an even bigger loss bigger loss and into an even bigger loss to< to the point where you cannot even to the point where you cannot even manage< manage it so as long as you keep to an manage it so as long as you keep to an Exit< Exit Plan you know when to take loss Exit Plan you know when to take loss then< then you're going to be able to survive then you're going to be able to survive this< this game for the long term in order for this game for the long term in order for you< you to be profitable as well so these you to be profitable as well so these are< are the five ways to prevent you know are the five ways to prevent you know huge< huge losing positions right try to huge losing positions right try to reduce< reduce the likelihood of huge losses and reduce the likelihood of huge losses and you< you definitely want to implement this you definitely want to implement this before< before you even start trading all right before you even start trading all right guys< guys that's it for this video and I hope guys that's it for this video and I hope you< you found this video helpful and

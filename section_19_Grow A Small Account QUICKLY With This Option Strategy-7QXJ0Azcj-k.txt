======================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about the we're going to be talking about the short< short put strategy but specifically for short put strategy but specifically for small< small accounts and the reason I wanted small accounts and the reason I wanted to< to create this video was because not too to create this video was because not too long< long ago I released this video on my long ago I released this video on my channel< channel uh I call it the 5K per month channel uh I call it the 5K per month passive< passive income strategy so basically passive income strategy so basically this< this video is where I Shar the short this video is where I Shar the short putut< putut strategy where you can use it to putut strategy where you can use it to generate< generate passive income now I had a lot generate passive income now I had a lot of< of people reach out to me after I of people reach out to me after I created< created this video that they like this created this video that they like this strategy< strategy a lot but I also had a few strategy a lot but I also had a few people< people that said you know they want to people that said you know they want to implement< implement this strategy but they can't implement this strategy but they can't because< because their account size is not too because their account size is not too big< big right for example one of the people big right for example one of the people that< that actually reached out to me said that actually reached out to me said this< this Davis I really love your video on this Davis I really love your video on the< the shut strategy and want to trade it the shut strategy and want to trade it but< but I have a small account of under but I have a small account of under $5,000< $5,000 so most of the examples you $5,000 so most of the examples you shared< shared are too expensive for my account shared are too expensive for my account size< size how can I apply this strategy to my size how can I apply this strategy to my small< small account size so this is a very small account size so this is a very very< very good question so first of all you very good question so first of all you need< need to understand which of the short need to understand which of the short put< put strategy you're actually trading so put strategy you're actually trading so when< when you're trading the short put when you're trading the short put there's< there's actually two types of strategy there's actually two types of strategy that< that you can trade right the very first that you can trade right the very first one< one is the cash secure putut right so one is the cash secure putut right so the< the cash secure putut basically your the cash secure putut basically your intention< intention is to Long the underlying intention is to Long the underlying shares< shares right so for every put option shares right so for every put option that< that you sell basically you want to get that you sell basically you want to get assigned< assigned on this put option which means assigned on this put option which means that< that you're going to get long 100 shares that you're going to get long 100 shares at< at the strike price that you choose so at the strike price that you choose so for< for this strategy is generally more for this strategy is generally more capital< capital intens ensive and the DTE capital intens ensive and the DTE selection< selection is actually less important selection is actually less important right< right because you don't mind getting right because you don't mind getting assigned< assigned right the whole idea of assigned right the whole idea of strategic< strategic DTE selection usually comes strategic DTE selection usually comes down< down to whether you want to get assigned down to whether you want to get assigned or< or not at least in my case the way I or not at least in my case the way I trade< trade it so if you don't mind getting trade it so if you don't mind getting assigned< assigned then you know cash SEC output assigned then you know cash SEC output the< the DT selection is not that important the DT selection is not that important and< and you can actually leave to expiration and you can actually leave to expiration because< because you don't mind getting assigned because you don't mind getting assigned right< right it's not like you want to avoid right it's not like you want to avoid assignment< assignment so that's the cash secure put assignment so that's the cash secure put now< now the other way to trade the short now the other way to trade the short putut< putut is with the naked put so the nut putut is with the naked put so the nut basically< basically just means that you have no basically just means that you have no intention< intention to Long the underlying shares intention to Long the underlying shares right< right that means you just want to get right that means you just want to get into< into the options and get out of the into the options and get out of the options< options with no assignment whatsoever so options with no assignment whatsoever so when< when you trade this nakp basically it's when you trade this nakp basically it's less< less Capital intensive because there's less Capital intensive because there's no< no need for you to go long the 100 no need for you to go long the 100 shares< shares per option and for this for the shares per option and for this for the nak< nak put DT selection is actually very nak put DT selection is actually very important< important right because you want to important right because you want to choose< choose the right DTE that actually gives choose the right DTE that actually gives you< you an edge in the long term and also you an edge in the long term and also living< living to expiration can lead to early living to expiration can lead to early assignment< assignment risk and potential Margin assignment risk and potential Margin Call< Call right because most of the time Call right because most of the time chances< chances are that your account size is chances are that your account size is not< not going to be big enough for you to not going to be big enough for you to Long< Long the 100 shares so for this video Long the 100 shares so for this video we're< we're not going to be talking about the we're not going to be talking about the cash< cash SEC put but instead we're going to cash SEC put but instead we're going to be< be talking about the naked put so the be talking about the naked put so the name< name by itself may sound scary right but name by itself may sound scary right but naked< naked put really just means that you're naked put really just means that you're trading< trading options without any intention to trading options without any intention to Long< Long the underlying shares all right so Long the underlying shares all right so this< this is very important so when you get this is very important so when you get into< into this naked put you can have into this naked put you can have unlimited< unlimited loss to the point whereby the unlimited loss to the point whereby the stock< stock goes to zero so you really need to stock goes to zero so you really need to know< know what you're going to do so if you know what you're going to do so if you want< want to trade this short putut which is want to trade this short putut which is basically< basically the niut on a small account basically the niut on a small account size< size then there are few things that you size then there are few things that you really< really need to take note of right so really need to take note of right so first< first thing is that if you have a small first thing is that if you have a small account< account right chances are that you're account right chances are that you're going< going to have a big limitation into the going to have a big limitation into the kind< kind of underlying that you can trade kind of underlying that you can trade right< right for example if I were to just do right for example if I were to just do this< this on the iwm right so iwm is the this on the iwm right so iwm is the smallest< smallest of the smallest of the three< three index ETFs the main ones basically three index ETFs the main ones basically the< the iwm the Spy as well as the QQQ right the iwm the Spy as well as the QQQ right there's< there's also the diamonds but of all of there's also the diamonds but of all of them< them the smallest one is iwm as you can them the smallest one is iwm as you can see< see is about 205 as of this recording so see is about 205 as of this recording so if< if you were to just put on a short putut if you were to just put on a short putut based< based on this iwm you can see that I based on this iwm you can see that I chose< chose one that is around 30 Delta with chose one that is around 30 Delta with the< the 193 strike price you can see that the 193 strike price you can see that straight< straight away the buying power for this straight away the buying power for this is< is about is about $2,000< $2,000 so what is this buying power $2,000 so what is this buying power effect< effect so buying power effect basically effect so buying power effect basically just< just means the amount that the broker is just means the amount that the broker is going< going to hold for you to put on this going to hold for you to put on this trade< trade right and one thing you need to trade right and one thing you need to understand< understand is that this buying power is understand is that this buying power is not< not static that means to say it can not static that means to say it can fluctuate< fluctuate right for example if after fluctuate right for example if after putting< putting it on if the market becomes very putting it on if the market becomes very volatile< volatile well it's possible that your volatile well it's possible that your broker< broker can actually increase the buying broker can actually increase the buying power< power effect that means this can power effect that means this can actually< actually go all the way to higher than actually go all the way to higher than $1,930< $1,930 right maybe it can go to 2,000 $1,930 right maybe it can go to 2,000 plus< plus and this is very important to note plus and this is very important to note because< because if you're going to trade the nip because if you're going to trade the nip in< in your account you need to make sure in your account you need to make sure that< that your position size is proper so that your position size is proper so with< with the limitation of your uh small with the limitation of your uh small account< account trading the short putut on such account trading the short putut on such index< index ETFs right such kind of underlying index ETFs right such kind of underlying that< that is higher price is going to be a that is higher price is going to be a problem< problem right as you can see $2,000 is problem right as you can see $2,000 is going< going to take a big chance of your going to take a big chance of your account< account right assuming your account size account right assuming your account size is< is $5,000 so one thing you can straight is $5,000 so one thing you can straight away< away do actually is to turn it into a away do actually is to turn it into a put< put spread right you can see down here put spread right you can see down here we< we still have the3 strike price but then we still have the3 strike price but then now< now we are going to buy a further out of now we are going to buy a further out of the< the money put option which is at 187 so the money put option which is at 187 so what< what you have done down here is that what you have done down here is that you've< you've actually limited the risk on this you've actually limited the risk on this trade< trade right so as you can see down here trade right so as you can see down here your< your buying power effect is actually now your buying power effect is actually now much< much lesser previously it was about much lesser previously it was about $1,900< $1,900 now it's $1,900 now it's $453< $453 so. you can see that just by buying $453 so you can see that just by buying that< that put option you are able to sort of that put option you are able to sort of trade< trade the put strategy right but the trade the put strategy right but the problem< problem is that this is a put spread and problem is that this is a put spread and not< not exactly a short put and I understand not exactly a short put and I understand from< from some people right because you have from some people right because you have reached< reached out to me and say that you reached out to me and say that you specifically< specifically want the short putut not specifically want the short putut not the< the put spread mainly because of the two the put spread mainly because of the two advantages< advantages right so for those of you who advantages right so for those of you who are< are not aware of the advantage of the are not aware of the advantage of the short< short putut versus the put spread is short putut versus the put spread is that< that there are basically two main that there are basically two main advantage< advantage right the very first main advantage right the very first main advantage< advantage is that you have the pure advantage is that you have the pure Theta< Theta Decay pure Theta Decay because you Theta Decay pure Theta Decay because you only< only have one short option whereas for only have one short option whereas for the< the put spread there the friction from the put spread there the friction from the< the long option right because you have the long option right because you have the< the short option as well as the long the short option as well as the long option< option because you're going to buy a option because you're going to buy a further< further out of the money long putut so further out of the money long putut so when< when you have that long putut option the when you have that long putut option the Theta< Theta Decay is not going to be as quick Theta Decay is not going to be as quick as< as compared to the short putut and the as compared to the short putut and the other< other Advantage is that it's easier to other Advantage is that it's easier to roll< roll even when it's in the money so one roll even when it's in the money so one thing< thing you will find that with a short thing you will find that with a short putut< putut even though it's in the money you putut even though it's in the money you can< can actually still roll it right you can can actually still roll it right you can roll< roll it out and down because it's just roll it out and down because it's just one< one single option but what you'll find one single option but what you'll find is< is that for the put spread most of the is that for the put spread most of the time< time if it's in the money you're going time if it's in the money you're going to< to find that it's actually going to be to find that it's actually going to be very< very difficult for you to roll for a very difficult for you to roll for a credit< credit right so for example this is the credit right so for example this is the put< put spread so you can see down here you put spread so you can see down here you have< have a minus one down here and then plus have a minus one down here and then plus one< one down here you have the put spread one down here you have the put spread down< down here so if the market actually down here so if the market actually comes< comes down here let's say for example it comes down here let's say for example it comes< comes closer to where this long put is comes closer to where this long put is chances< chances are this put spread when you chances are this put spread when you roll< roll it it's going to be for a debit roll it it's going to be for a debit right< right so if it's for a debit chances are right so if it's for a debit chances are that< that you don't want to roll it because that you don't want to roll it because you're< you're going to be actually paying more you're going to be actually paying more whereas< whereas for the short putut if you just whereas for the short putut if you just have< have this short putut alone and same have this short putut alone and same thing< thing if it goes down you will find that thing if it goes down you will find that actually< actually you are able to still roll this actually you are able to still roll this for< for a credit right you can still roll for a credit right you can still roll out< out to a further expiration date and out to a further expiration date and then< then roll down the strike price as well then roll down the strike price as well and< and trying to find one where you can get and trying to find one where you can get a< a credit so that is why you know quite a a credit so that is why you know quite a number< number of people have mentioned that yes number of people have mentioned that yes I< I understand that the put spread is much I understand that the put spread is much more< more safer in a sense because you know more safer in a sense because you know if< if the market crashes you still only if the market crashes you still only lose< lose lose whatever you reach at the lose lose whatever you reach at the start< start but at the same time they want a start but at the same time they want a short< short putut because they want to get the short putut because they want to get the quicker< quicker profits right so if you talk quicker profits right so if you talk about< about quickness in terms of profit short about quickness in terms of profit short putut< putut will be always faster because putut will be always faster because there's< there's no friction from the long option there's no friction from the long option at< at the same time it's also easier to at the same time it's also easier to roll< roll so this is where a lot of people roll so this is where a lot of people want< want to do this right whenever it's in want to do this right whenever it's in the< the money they want to keep rolling out the money they want to keep rolling out and< and down until the point where the and down until the point where the market< market eventually recovers and go back market eventually recovers and go back up< up and then they're going to be profit up and then they're going to be profit on< on the whole position so I understand on the whole position so I understand this< this point so what we're going to do is this point so what we're going to do is that< that we're going to try and keep cater that we're going to try and keep cater this< this short put strategy just for the this short put strategy just for the small< small account so the question now small account so the question now becomes< becomes how do you trade short puts for becomes how do you trade short puts for small< small accounts well the answer is really small accounts well the answer is really pretty< pretty simple and the answer is to pretty simple and the answer is to Simply< Simply find underlyings that are lower Simply find underlyings that are lower price< price right maybe for example under $50 price right maybe for example under $50 because< because remember when you put on the because remember when you put on the short< short putut you need to identify what is short putut you need to identify what is the< the buying power basically what is the the buying power basically what is the amount< amount that the broker is going to hold amount that the broker is going to hold for< for you to put on the trade so if you're for you to put on the trade so if you're going< going to do it on iwm for example like I going to do it on iwm for example like I showed< showed you earlier you can see that is showed you earlier you can see that is such< such a big amount right so there's no such a big amount right so there's no way< way for you to put up this uh short way for you to put up this uh short putut< putut on the small account so instead putut on the small account so instead what< what you want to do is to straight away what you want to do is to straight away find< find the underlying that is much cheaper find the underlying that is much cheaper so< so here are a few examples right so so here are a few examples right so first< first of all let me remind you please do first of all let me remind you please do your< your own due diligence right don't just your own due diligence right don't just take< take the list down here and then just take the list down here and then just put< put it on your own right you need to put it on your own right you need to find< find out whether this underly is find out whether this underly is suitable< suitable for you so it's is not a suitable for you so it's is not a recommendation< recommendation for you to trade any of recommendation for you to trade any of the< the stocks I'm just pointing out some of the stocks I'm just pointing out some of the< the underlines that I see that can be the underlines that I see that can be suitable< suitable in terms of the buying power suitable in terms of the buying power requirement< requirement which you can actually put requirement which you can actually put on< on your account so let's assume you have on your account so let's assume you have maybe< maybe a $5,000 account so the very first maybe a $5,000 account so the very first example< example would be paler right so as you example would be paler right so as you can< can see paler as of this recording is can see paler as of this recording is around around around $27< $27 so it's not very expensive and if $27 so it's not very expensive and if you< you were to just put on the put option you were to just put on the put option down< down here so as you can see I've down here so as you can see I've selected< selected the 24 strike which is roughly selected the 24 strike which is roughly around< around 30 Deltas you can see that the around 30 Deltas you can see that the buying< buying power is only buying power is only $240< $240 which is not too bad so if you have $240 which is not too bad so if you have a< a $55,000 account you can definitely put a $55,000 account you can definitely put on< on this trade or maybe if you even have on this trade or maybe if you even have a< a smaller account size like $3,000 you a smaller account size like $3,000 you can< can definitely still put on this trade can definitely still put on this trade because< because you can see that the buying because you can see that the buying power< power is not that much now another power is not that much now another example< example would be Ford motors right so example would be Ford motors right so the< the ticket symbol is f as you can see the ticket symbol is f as you can see down< down here for is even cheaper right and down here for is even cheaper right and this< this recording for is only roughly about this recording for is only roughly about $987< $987 and the strike price that I chosen $987 and the strike price that I chosen is< is $9 so again roughly about 30 deltas is $9 so again roughly about 30 deltas and< and you can see for this the buying and you can see for this the buying power< power that you need to put on this trade power that you need to put on this trade is< is only is only $111< $111 which is not so much right so if $111 which is not so much right so if you< you have a small account definitely you you have a small account definitely you can< can put this on now the next one is can put this on now the next one is fiser< fiser so tier symbol PF as you can see fiser so tier symbol PF as you can see fiser< fiser is roughly around $30 so pretty fiser is roughly around $30 so pretty similar< similar to palente here and if you were similar to palente here and if you were to< to put on the strike price of 27. 5 to put on the strike price of 27.

5 Delta< Delta roughly about 21 then you can get Delta roughly about 21 then you can get a< a buying power of roughly a buying power of roughly $361< $361 again it's not that much right all $361 again it's not that much right all this< this buying power you notice is under this buying power you notice is under $500< $500 so it's very simple for you to put $500 so it's very simple for you to put on< on this uh short putut if you want to on this uh short putut if you want to but< but of course do not just put on this but of course do not just put on this short< short putut just because you know it's a short putut just because you know it's a cheap< cheap underline you still have to find cheap underline you still have to find the< the right setup and have proper Rich the right setup and have proper Rich management< management which I'm going to share with management which I'm going to share with you< you in a later slide later on now here you in a later slide later on now here are< are a few other examples now this is for are a few other examples now this is for the< the index ETF so stocks can be a little the index ETF so stocks can be a little bit< bit more volatile so if you're the kind bit more volatile so if you're the kind of< of person that you know want slightly of person that you know want slightly less< less volatile under line then you can go less volatile under line then you can go for< for the index ETF right for example one for the index ETF right for example one of< of them is GDX so GDX is the VC go minus of them is GDX so GDX is the VC go minus ETF< ETF you can see down here uh using the ETF you can see down here uh using the strike< strike price of 34 you have the buying strike price of 34 you have. the buying power< power of slightly above $500 you have power of slightly above $500 you have the< the gdxj which is the junior go minus so the gdxj which is the junior go minus so same< same thing as well the strike price of same thing as well the strike price of $39< $39 you get you know the buying power of $39 you get you know the buying power of roughly roughly roughly $535< $535 and finally SPG so splg basically $535 and finally SPG so splg basically is< is S&amp;P 500 right is the same as Spy only is S&amp;P 500 right is the same as Spy only that< that this is much much cheaper right as that this is much much cheaper right as you< you can see this is only about you can see this is only about $61< $61 so for example if you want to trade $61 so for example if you want to trade the< the S&amp;P 500 but then you know spy is way the S&amp;P 500 but then you know spy is way too< too big you can actually consider this too big you can actually consider this SPG< SPG because if you put on the 58 strike SPG because if you put on the 58 strike price< price you can see that the buying power price you can see that the buying power is< is about $580 so definitely much more is about $580 so definitely much more suitable< suitable if you have a small account and suitable if you have a small account and if< if you also want a safer way you know to if you also want a safer way you know to trade< trade this short puts so one thing that trade this short puts so one thing that you< you will find is that with some of this you will find is that with some of this underline< underline the spread can be pretty wide underline the spread can be pretty wide so< so as you can see down here the spread so as you can see down here the spread is< is $125 to. 75 so it's pretty wide uh is $125 to.

75 so it's pretty wide uh down< down here as well you see $150 to $25 so down here as well you see $150 to $25 so this< this is one thing you need to take note this is one thing you need to take note of< of if you were to choose some of this of if you were to choose some of this lower< lower price underline all right so let's lower price underline all right so let's get< get into the actual steps of of how do get into the actual steps of of how do you< you put on the short put strategy for you put on the short put strategy for small< small accounts by the way if you like small accounts by the way if you like this< this video so far Please Subscribe. and this video so far Please Subscribe and also< also click the thumbs up button and also also click the thumbs up button and also do< do get your free copy of the options do get your free copy of the options income< income blueprint where I share the top income blueprint where I share the top three< three options strategies that help you three options strategies that help you generate< generate a consistent income each month generate a consistent income each month trading< trading just one to two hours a day trading just one to two hours a day right< right so if you want to go ahead to get right so if you want to go ahead to get this< this copy just head on over to options this copy just head on over to options with< with davis. com blueprint all right back with davis.

com blueprint all right back to< to the video so step number one is to to the video so step number one is to build< build a watch list of low price stocks build a watch list of low price stocks and< and index ETFs you know preferably under and index ETFs you know preferably under $50< $50 because that's where you are able to $50 because that's where you are able to have< have the short putut whereby the buying have the short putut whereby the buying power< power is you know uh manageable right power is you know uh manageable right basically< basically under $500 now the second step basically under $500 now the second step now< now that you've already built a watch now that you've already built a watch list< list of all these low price stocks and list of all these low price stocks and index< index ETFs what you want to do is to go index ETFs what you want to do is to go through< through each of them right go through through each of them right go through each< each of them and try and find the ones each of them and try and find the ones that< that are in an uptrend right so as you that are in an uptrend right so as you can< can see down here this is an underlying can see down here this is an underlying that< that is pretty much in an uptrend right that is pretty much in an uptrend right so< so how do you identify an uptrend so so how do you identify an uptrend so basic< basic basically uptrend we have this basic basically uptrend we have this characteristic< characteristic where it's forming these characteristic where it's forming these waves< waves right basically it will form waves right basically it will form higher< higher highs and then higher lows so higher highs and then higher lows so once< once you found the underlyings that is once you found the underlyings that is in< in an uptrend now this is where you get in an uptrend now this is where you get into< into step number three and you add the into step number three and you add the indicator< indicator that's called the stochastic indicator that's called the stochastic oscillator< oscillator right so the stochastic oscillator right so the stochastic oscillator< oscillator basically is an indicator oscillator basically is an indicator that< that kind of tells you whether the that kind of tells you whether the market< market is in an overbought or over so market is in an overbought or over so condition< condition right so as you can see down condition right so as you can see down here< here I've already attached this uh here I've already attached this uh stochastic< stochastic oscillator at the bottom down stochastic oscillator at the bottom down here< here so basically what you will see is here so basically what you will see is that< that if this blue line goes above the that if this blue line goes above the red< red line at the top then this what is red line at the top then this what is called< called overbought but if it goes below called overbought but if it goes below the< the red line at the bottom then this is the red line at the bottom then this is what< what is called oversold so what we want what is called oversold so what we want to< to look out for when we are trading the to look out for when we are trading the short< short putut is for the oversold signal short putut is for the oversold signal to< to come out right we want to see that to come out right we want to see that the< the squiggly line is below this red line the squiggly line is below this red line before< before we decide to enter into any trade before we decide to enter into any trade right< right so this is where you want to put right so this is where you want to put more< more odds in your favor now that is not more odds in your favor now that is not to< to say that after it's oversold that the to say that after it's oversold that the market< market is immediately going to bounce up market is immediately going to bounce up right< right we never know right because right we never know right because oversold< oversold can go a little bit more oversold can go a little bit more oversold< oversold and the market can still oversold and the market can still continue< continue to go down what's important continue to go down what's important again< again like I mentioned all the time is again like I mentioned all the time is that< that we are basing it off probability that we are basing it off probability and< and if you were to think about it from a and if you were to think about it from a very< very strategic point of view which is very strategic point of view which is much< much better for you to enter when the much better for you to enter when the market< market is overboard do you enter the market is overboard do you enter the short< short putut when it's overboard when the short putut when it's overboard when the market< market is going up or when the market market is going up or when the market has< has already gone down quite a bit and has already gone down quite a bit and it's< it's oversold and there's a likely it's oversold and there's a likely chance< chance that there can be a bounce right chance that there can be a bounce right so< so most likely you want to enter the so most likely you want to enter the short< short putut when it's oversold so once short putut when it's oversold so once you< you have already identified the you have already identified the underlyings< underlyings that is oversold you get underlyings that is oversold you get into< into stop four this is where you also into stop four this is where you also want< want to identify support levels right so want to identify support levels right so again< again support levels are places where again support levels are places where you< you can see that the prices have bounced you can see that the prices have bounced off< off and you can see that maybe there's a off and you can see that maybe there's a chance< chance for the price to go up again so chance for the price to go up again so again< again we're just adding more things into again we're just adding more things into our< our favor right adding the odds in our our favor right adding the odds in our favor< favor so this way at least every trade favor so this way at least every trade that< that we put on at least there's a that we put on at least there's a greater< greater chance of it working out than it greater chance of it working out than it does< does not but that is not to say that you does not but that is not to say that you won't< won't have losers all right so just won't have losers all right so just remember< remember that losses will come it's remember that losses will come it's inevitable< inevitable you just have to make sure inevitable you just have to make sure that< that when the losses come you me them that when the losses come you me them properly< properly so once you've identified the properly so once you've identified the support< support levels then this is where we get support levels then this is where we get into< into step number five and this is where into step number five and. this is where you< you enter into the SHP right so what we you enter into the SHP right so what we want< want to do is we want to identify the want to do is we want to identify the strike< strike prices that is below the support strike prices that is below the support down< down here so let's say for example if down here so let's say for example if you< you know that the support is around $30 you know that the support is around $30 right< right so let's say the support is at $30 right so let's say the support is at $30 then< then you want to go for the strike then you want to go for the strike prices< prices that is below $30 right so if prices that is below $30 right so if you're< you're a little bit more bullish then you're a little bit more bullish then you< you can probably go for the short put you can probably go for the short put strike< strike price that is just below the strike price that is just below the support< support right so if you go for one support right so if you go for one that's< that's just below the support what that's just below the support what you're< you're going to find is that you're you're going to find is that you're going< going to get higher premiums but then going to get higher premiums but then your< your probability of profit is going to your probability of profit is going to be< be lower right so this is always a be lower right so this is always a trade-off< trade-off but let's say you're a little trade-off but let's say you're a little bit< bit more conservative right you don't bit more conservative right you don't want< want to go for one that is close to the want to go for one that is close to the support< support level you want to play it safe support level you want to play it safe you< you want to go for a further out of the you want to go for a further out of the money< money put option so in this case what money put option so in this case what you< you will find is that you will have you will find is that you will have lesser< lesser premium but you're going to have lesser premium but you're going to have a< a higher win rate right so this is a higher win rate right so this is always< always a trade-off so which one is always a trade-off so which one is better< better there's not one that's better it better there's not one that's better it really< really all comes down to you so you just really all comes down to you so you just need< need to understand that as long as you need to understand that as long as you place< place the put option below the support place the put option below the support level< level then at least you've already stack level then at least you've already stack the< the odds in your favor because remember the odds in your favor because remember number< number one we have the market trending number one we have the market trending upwards< upwards so this gives us an indication upwards so this gives us an indication that< that there is a likelihood that the that there is a likelihood that the market< market can still continue to go up right market can still continue to go up right and< and secondly we also have the stochastic and secondly we also have the stochastic oscillator< oscillator that is telling us that it's oscillator that is telling us that it's currently< currently in an oversold condition so currently in an oversold condition so the< the market has already sold off quite a the market has already sold off quite a bit< bit that means it could reach a point bit that means it could reach a point whereby< whereby you know it's a little bit whereby you know it's a little bit exhausted< exhausted to the downside and then it exhausted to the downside and then it can< can come back up and finally thirdly we can come back up and finally thirdly we also< also have this support level down here also have this support level down here so< so this support level gives you an added so this support level gives you an added chance< chance that you know if the market chance that you know if the market actually< actually comes down to this support actually comes down to this support level< level again there's a chance that it level again there's a chance that it could< could bounce back up so with all this in could bounce back up so with all this in place< place and you also have the short putut place and you also have the short putut that< that is below the support level you that is below the support level you should< should be able to find such kind of should be able to find such kind of setups< setups that gives you you know pretty setups that gives you you know pretty high< high probability of Entry so now that high probability of Entry so now that we've< we've already gone through this last we've already gone through this last step< step of entering into the trades let's step of entering into the trades let's get< get into the most important one which is get into the most important one which is Step< Step number six that is the exit tactics Step number six that is the exit tactics so< so this is where quite a number of so this is where quite a number of people< people really fumble and panic people really fumble and panic especially< especially when the market really CR especially when the market really CR presses< presses right so you really need to know presses right so you really need to know what< what to do especially with a short put what to do especially with a short put remember< remember right now with a short put this remember right now with a short put this is< is a naked put there is no protection to is a naked put there is no protection to the< the downside from a long put option the downside from a long put option right< right there's no long put so it's not a right there's no long put so it's not a put< put spread so in this case you really put spread so in this case you really need< need to be very sharp as to how to need to be very sharp as to how to manage< manage it if your put option is in a manage it if your put option is in a loss< loss so first of all let's talk about loss so first of all let's talk about what< what if this put option is in a profit what if this put option is in a profit right< right so if it's in a profit it's right so if it's in a profit it's actually< actually pretty simple right this is actually pretty simple right this is where< where a lot of people will probably also where a lot of people will probably also know< know how to manage so there are few ways know how to manage so there are few ways to< to do this number one you can just exit to do this number one you can just exit at< at 50% take profit right so 50% take at 50% take profit right so 50% take profit< profit is basically just half of the profit is basically just half of the credit< credit that you receive so for example credit that you receive so for example if< if you receive say if you receive say $2. 50< $2.

50 for this credit what is the take $2. 50 for this credit what is the take profit< profit of this right basically the take profit of this right basically the take profit< profit of this will be at profit of this will be at a125< a125 so a lot of people do get confused a125 so a lot of people do get confused because< because when you're new to trading you because when you're new to trading you know< know options especially options you need know options especially options you need to< to understand that what you're doing is to understand that what you're doing is that< that you always sell at a higher price that you always sell at a higher price and< and you want to buy back at. a lower and you want to buy back at a lower price< price right so if you sell it at $250 price right so if you sell it at $250 and< and you buy back at and you buy back at $125< $125 then you're actually in a profit of $125 then you're actually in a profit of a125< a125 so per option contract that is a125 so per option contract that is $125< $125 but if you see the option price at $125 but if you see the option price at the< the point of time is above $250 so let's the point of time is above $250 so let's say< say for example it's at say for example it's at $3.

50< $3. 50 so what this is telling you is $3.

50 so what this is telling you is that< that your trade is is in a loss. right that your trade is is in a loss right because< because you sold it at $2. 50 but if you because you sold it at $2.

50 but if you were< were to buy back at $350 this is were to buy back at $350 this is actually< actually going to be a loss of a dollar actually going to be a loss of a dollar which< which is $100 per option contract so for which is $100 per option contract so for us< us as option sellers we want to see that us as option sellers we want to see that the< the current price the option price that the current price the option price that is< is marking for is less than what we sold is marking for is less than what we sold it< it for right so a 50% take profit is it for right so a 50% take profit is basically< basically just half of the credit that basically just half of the credit that you< you receive up front for selling this you receive up front for selling this option< option now the other way you can manage option now the other way you can manage it< it is at 21 DTE so I've shared this in it is at 21 DTE so I've shared this in quite< quite a number of my videos already you quite a number of my videos already you can< can just go ahead to look at some of my can just go ahead to look at some of. my videos< videos in my channel but 21 DT basically videos in my channel but 21 DT basically is< is a study that the tasty trade team has is a study that the tasty trade team has already< already done that if you were to Exit 21 already done that if you were to Exit 21 DT< DT in the end you're going to have you DT in the end you're going to have you know< know much more Superior performance know much more Superior performance compared< compared to if you were to just hold all compared to if you were to just hold all the< the way to expiration right but with the way to expiration right but with that< that said I know that some people do that said I know that some people do want< want to have the option of holding to want to have the option of holding to expiration< expiration because after all if the expiration because after all if the market< market is above your Sher strike right market is above your Sher strike right imagine< imagine it keeps going up then why not imagine it keeps going up then why not just< just capture the whole premium that is just capture the whole premium that is given< given to you at the start right this given to you at the start right this whole whole whole $2. 50< $2.

50 so some people have that thinking $2. 50 so some people have that thinking so< so you know if you want to hold to so you know if you want to hold to expiration< expiration you can definitely do so as expiration you can definitely do so as well< well but just remember this any option well but just remember this any option will< will only generally go to $0 at will only generally go to $0 at expiration< expiration so let's say for example if expiration so let's say for example if you< you put this on roughly at 45 DTE and you put this on roughly at 45 DTE and then< then let's say about 10 days in 10 days then let's say about 10 days in 10 days in< in that means now it's at 35 DTE so if in that means now it's at 35 DTE so if it's< it's at 35 DTS and you see that you've it's at 35 DTS and you see that you've already< already made let's say maybe about $2 already made let's say maybe about $2 that< that means to say this 250 has dropped that means to say this 250 has dropped down< down to 50 cents right so you have down to 50 cents right so you have already< already made $2 on this trade which is already made $2 on this trade which is $200< $200 because the market has just gone up $200 because the market has just gone up right< right but for you to make that remaining right but for you to make that remaining 50< 50 cents you have to wait another 35 50 cents you have to wait another 35 days< days does it make sense for you to wait days does it make sense for you to wait 35< 35 days when you've already made you 35 days when you've already made you know< know $2 in just 10 days so what you're know $2 in just 10 days so what you're doing< doing at that point of time is that doing at that point of time is that you're< you're risking the additional $ you you're risking the additional $ you already< already made uh on the remaining 35 days already made uh on the remaining 35 days right< right just so that you can make this 50 right just so that you can make this 50 cents< cents so most of the time I wouldn't say cents so most of the time I wouldn't say that< that would make sense at all so you that would make sense at all so you would< would rather just take it off uh rather would rather just take it off uh rather than< than risk the whole thing so at the end than risk the whole thing so at the end of< of the day it's really up to you to of the day it's really up to you to decide< decide so I'm just giving you a decide so I'm just giving you a guideline< guideline over here now the next one so guideline over here now the next one so this< this is a very important one to this is a very important one to understand< understand which is the loss and a lot understand which is the loss and a lot of< of people just do not manage it well of people just do not manage it well right< right so one thing you need to really right so one thing you need to really keep< keep in mind and really take note is keep in mind and really take note is that< that losses will come losses will happen that losses will come losses will happen a< a lot of people want to get into trades a lot of people want to get into trades avoiding< avoiding this loss right so for example avoiding this loss right so for example if< if you get into a 30 Delta short putut if you get into a 30 Delta short putut so< so roughly it will be a 70% win rate so roughly it will be a 70% win rate right< right so you will win 70% of 10 but what right so you will win 70% of 10 but what it< it also means is that you will lose 30% it also means is that you will lose 30% of< of the time 30% of the time it will be a of the time 30% of the time it will be a loss< loss and the probability already depicts loss and the probability already depicts it< it right you cannot avoid this loss so it right you cannot avoid this loss so when< when the loss happens you really need to when the loss happens you really need to know< know how to man manage it well and not know how to man manage it well and not let< let this short putut really blow up your let this short putut really blow up your account< account because some people you know account because some people you know they< they do not want to take the loss they they do not want to take the loss they hope< hope that the market will come back up hope that the market will come back up they< they hold on to the trade only to see they hold on to the trade only to see that< that the market continue to crash and that the market continue to crash and then< then they lose a lot much more than what then they lose a lot much more than what they< they initially wanted so how do you they initially wanted so how do you define< define this loss so the very first thing define this loss so the very first thing the< the most important thing is to the most important thing is to understand< understand where your max cut off point understand where your max cut off point is< is that means this is the worst case is that means this is the worst case scenario< scenario the maximum loss you can make scenario the maximum loss you can make so< so the maximum loss you want to it so the maximum loss you want to it really< really is at the initial buying power really is at the initial buying power for< for the trade so remember earlier I for the trade so remember earlier I shared< shared with you that whenever you put on shared with you that whenever you put on the< the short putut your broker will show the short putut your broker will show you< you this buying power effect right or you this buying power effect right or buying< buying power reduction depending on you buying power reduction depending on you know< know what's the term that your broker Ed know what's the term that your broker Ed but< but basically it's the amount that the but basically it's the amount that the broker< broker holds on to the trade for the for broker holds on to the trade for the for you< you to put on the trade right so this you to put on the trade right so this initial< initial buying power is where you want initial buying power is where you want to< to cut off the loss now let's say for to cut off the loss now let's say for example< example if you put on this sh p and example if you put on this sh p and let's< let's just say that the buying power for let's just say that the buying power for this< this is this is $250< $250 which means to say if it reaches to $250 which means to say if it reaches to a< a point whereby the market drops so far a point whereby the market drops so far down< down that you see that the open loss for down that you see that the open loss for this< this trade is this trade is $250< $250 what you want to do is immediately $250 what you want to do is immediately close< close out this trade why because if you close out this trade why because if you don't< don't do that and the market continues don't do that and the market continues to< to crash all the way down to zero then to crash all the way down to zero then you< you can lose a lot more money and we you can lose a lot more money and we don't< don't want that to happen so that is why don't want that to happen so that is why this< this is the worst case scenario once it this is the worst case scenario once it reaches< reaches your initial buying power you reaches your initial buying power you have< have have to cut it off now what if it have have to cut it off now what if it doesn't< doesn't reach your initial buying power doesn't reach your initial buying power right< right so the good news is that the right so the good news is that the chances< chances of it reaching the initial chances of it reaching the initial buying< buying power is not that high because buying power is not that high because the< the broker have already set aside an the broker have already set aside an amount< amount that they want to hold on from amount that they want to hold on from you< you to a point whereby they think that you to a point whereby they think that it's< it's unlikely for the market to get it's unlikely for the market to get there< there that means to say that the market there that means to say that the market really< really has to go way down for you to really has to go way down for you to ever< ever reach this amount right which is ever reach this amount right which is why< why the broker actually holds on to this why the broker actually holds on to this amount< amount so the chances of you reaching amount so the chances of you reaching this< this is not that high so what do you do this is not that high so what do you do then< then in that case this is where you want then in that case this is where you want to< to exit at 21 DTE the latest so it could to exit at 21 DTE the latest so it could be< be that you know the market has already be that you know the market has already gone< gone past your short put right so this gone past your short put right so this short< short putut down here is what you call short putut down here is what you call in< in the money so if you're in the money in the money so if you're in the money that< that is always a chance of the early that is always a chance of the early assignment< assignment risk right early assignment assignment risk right early assignment risk< risk just means that your shut is going risk just means that your shut is going to< to get assigned you're going to get the to get assigned you're going to get the 100< 100 shares if you don't have def funds 100 shares if you don't have def funds for< for the 100 shares you're going to get a for the 100 shares you're going to get a margin< margin call So to avoid this or rather margin call So to avoid this or rather to< to reduce the chances of this you want to reduce the chances of this you want to< to exit at 21 DTE the latest which means to exit at 21 DTE the latest which means to< to say there's 21 days left to the to say there's 21 days left to the expiration< expiration of this option so why 21 DTE expiration of this option so why 21 DTE well< well firstly because again back to the well firstly because again back to the tasty< tasty trade study they have already tasty trade study they have already shown< shown that based on 21 DTE you get much shown that based on 21 DTE you get much more< more Superior performance including the more Superior performance including the losses< losses right because you are cutting the losses right because you are cutting the losses< losses at a point whereby it's losses at a point whereby it's manageable< manageable but if you were to leave it manageable but if you were to leave it all< all the way to maybe even expiration the all the way to maybe even expiration the loss< loss could get very big if the market loss could get very big if the market continues< continues to go down so 21 DT you cut continues to go down so 21 DT you cut the< the loss to a minimum at the same time the loss to a minimum at the same time you< you have a reduced chance of getting you have a reduced chance of getting assigned< assigned right because at. 21dt you still assigned right because at 21dt you still have< have some extrinsic value so when you have some extrinsic value so when you still< still some extrinsic value in this short still some extrinsic value in this short putut< putut the chances of being assigned is putut the chances of being assigned is not< not that high so that is why if you are not that high so that is why if you are seeing< seeing that you are loss and then you seeing that you are loss and then you know< know it's not at your max loss yet of know it's not at your max loss yet of the< the initial buying power once it's the initial buying power once it's reached< reached 21 DT exit it now there's one reached 21 DT exit it now there's one more< more option right this is the option more option right this is the option that< that a lot of people want to do and that that a lot of people want to do and that is< is to roll up and down your put option is to roll up and down your put option right< right that means for example if the right that means for example if the current< current put option has maybe about say current put option has maybe about say 25< 25 DTE left so what you want to do is 25 DTE left so what you want to do is that< that you roll it out to a further that you roll it out to a further timeline< timeline right so maybe you go to the timeline right so maybe you go to the next< next 45 DTE so when you extend it and next 45 DTE so when you extend it and have< have more time you're going to have more have more time you're going to have more extensive< extensive value you're going to have the extensive value you're going to have the premium< premium as well at the same time you can premium as well at the same time you can bring< bring this strike price down as well so bring this strike price down as well so you< you can have a lower strike price and you can have a lower strike price and overall< overall for a premium but the key thing overall for a premium but the key thing down< down here is that you only do this if down here is that you only do this if you< you are still bullish because if the you are still bullish because if the stock< stock is going to keep crashing even stock is going to keep crashing even after< after you roll no matter how many times after you roll no matter how many times you< you roll down and out you're still going you roll down and out you're still going to< to get caught right it's still going to to get caught right it's still going to be< be a loss and your loss is going to just be a loss and your loss is going to just only< only keep increasing and increasing as only keep increasing and increasing as the< the market goes down so this is only if the market goes down so this is only if you< you still hold a bullish view on the you still hold a bullish view on the underline< underline but if you don't hold a underline but if you don't hold a bullish< bullish view on the underline then bullish view on the underline then basically< basically just exit at 21 DTE so roll up basically just exit at 21 DTE so roll up and< and down so how do you roll this so and down so how do you roll this so there< there are two ways you can do this the there are two ways you can do this the first< first way is when the short putut is first way is when the short putut is bridged< bridged so this is the most defensive bridged so this is the most defensive one< one when you roll out and down the one when you roll out and down the moment< moment your short putut is Bridge moment your short putut is Bridge basically< basically you're able to roll it to a basically you're able to roll it to a further< further away strike price right because further away strike price right because this< this is time where your exchange Z value this is time where your exchange Z value is< is quite high so you want to choose a is quite high so you want to choose a further< further DTE so one thing is that if you further DTE so one thing is that if you were< were to roll it when the short putut is were to roll it when the short putut is bridged< bridged what you will find is that bridged what you will find is that sometimes< sometimes you can get to a point where sometimes you can get to a point where the< the DTE is just too huge for example the DTE is just too huge for example let's< let's say when you put on this option is let's say when you put on this option is 45 45 45 DTE< DTE and the moment you put it on let's DTE and the moment you put it on let's just< just say the next day the market has just say the next day the market has just< just traded all the way down right it just traded all the way down right it crashed< crashed and then it reach your shut crashed and then it reach your shut strike< strike now at this point if you want to strike now at this point if you want to roll< roll out in time you might have to roll roll out in time you might have to roll to< to a much further time right maybe 607 to a much further time right maybe 607 DT< DT on and so on so now you've gone much DT on and so on so now you've gone much further< further in time which also means that further in time which also means that the< the Theta Decay is not going to be that the Theta Decay is not going to be that high< high as well because Theta generally high as well because Theta generally tends< tends to Decay much quicker as the days tends to Decay much quicker as the days to< to expiration the DTE becomes lesser and to expiration the DTE becomes lesser and lesser< lesser and lesser so 67 is still quite a lesser and lesser so 67 is still quite a bit< bit so imagine if you really roll it bit so imagine if you really roll it down< down to this point down here and then down to this point down here and then all< all of a sudden you know in the next few all of a sudden you know in the next few days< days the market goes down again and if days the market goes down again and if the< the market goes down to the next uh the market goes down to the next uh point< point in time whereby you roll it to point in time whereby you roll it to then< then if you want to roll it now you may then if you want to roll it now you may have< have to go for an even further one so have to go for an even further one so maybe< maybe now you have to go for like 90 DTS maybe now you have to go for like 90 DTS or< or something like that so so when you do or something like that so so when you do it< it this way chances are you may reach a it this way chances are you may reach a point< point whereby you have no choice but to point whereby you have no choice but to stop< stop rolling because the DTE gets a stop rolling because the DTE gets a little< little bit too big so that's the very little bit too big so that's the very first< first way right this is the most first way right this is the most defensive< defensive way now the second way is at defensive way now the second way is at 21< 21 DTE so that means you don't care what 21 DTE so that means you don't care what the< the market is doing right as long as the the market is doing right as long as the market< market does not reach the initial buying market does not reach the initial buying power< power for the trade that means the max power for the trade that means the max loss< loss cut off point if it doesn't reach loss cut off point if it doesn't reach there< there you just wait until it's 21 DTE there you just wait until it's 21 DTE and< and see where the market is right let's and see where the market is right let's say< say if the market is somewhere here then say if the market is somewhere here then this< this is where you try and roll it again this is where you try and roll it again so< so you roll up and down so if at this so you roll up and down so if at this point< point if the market is really below the point if the market is really below the short< short putut then you can actually still short putut then you can actually still roll< roll it down for a credit right roll out roll it down for a credit right roll out and< and down but the problem is that you may and down but the problem is that you may not< not roll down as far right you may not not roll down as far right you may

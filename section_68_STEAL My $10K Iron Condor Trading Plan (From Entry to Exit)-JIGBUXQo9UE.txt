===========================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you the I'm going to be sharing with you the seven< seven step iron Condor trading plan so seven step iron Condor trading plan so this< this is a complete trading plan that this is a complete trading plan that gives< gives you the entry all the way to the gives you the entry all the way to the exit< exit so if you are new to trading iron exit so if you are new to trading iron Condors< Condors right you have never traded iron Condors right you have never traded iron Condors< Condors before and you're interested you Condors before and you're interested you know< know just to try it out or maybe you've know just to try it out or maybe you've been< been trading iron Condos for a while and been trading iron Condos for a while and you< you want something much more concrete you want something much more concrete then< then you can definitely use this trading then you can definitely use this trading plan< plan now this is a very simple trading plan now this is a very simple trading plan< plan it is not the only way that you can plan it is not the only way that you can construct< construct you know the way to trade iron construct you know the way to trade iron Condors< Condors but it's definitely a good way Condors but it's definitely a good way to< to get started right a good way to get to get started right a good way to get your< your feet wet into trading iron Condors your feet wet into trading iron Condors okay< okay so without further Ado let's get okay so without further Ado let's get into< into this seven steps now the very first into this seven steps now the very first step< step is to build your watch list right step is to build your watch list right so< so your watch list would normally so your watch list would normally consist< consist of index ETFs and individual consist of index ETFs and individual stocks< stocks now when it comes to trading iron stocks now when it comes to trading iron Condors< Condors my preferred approach would be Condors my preferred approach would be to< to trade the index ETFs so if you were to trade the index ETFs so if you were to< to take a look down here this is a graph to take a look down here this is a graph down< down here that shows you know the down here that shows you know the movements< movements between the ETFs and the movements between the ETFs and the stocks< stocks so as you can see down here ETFs stocks so as you can see down here ETFs is< is this uh color light blue whereas the is this uh color light blue whereas the stocks< stocks is more towards the orangey stocks is more towards the orangey yellow< yellow color right so as you can see yellow color right so as you can see down< down here what this graph is really down here what this graph is really showing< showing you is that the range down here showing you is that the range down here of< of the ETFs is usually much more of the ETFs is usually much more concentrated< concentrated more tighter towards the concentrated more tighter towards the center< center part whereas the stocks wise center part whereas the stocks wise right< right as you can see their range is much right as you can see their range is much bigger< bigger right so when we are trading iron bigger right so when we are trading iron Condors< Condors what you need to understand is Condors what you need to understand is that< that this is a strategy that seeks to that this is a strategy that seeks to profit< profit when the market stays within a profit when the market stays within a certain< certain range right because we have a a certain range right because we have a a call< call spread at the top and we have a put call spread at the top and we have a put spread< spread at the bottom so let me just draw spread at the bottom so let me just draw out< out this uh iron Condor structure down out this uh iron Condor structure down here< here so as you can see down here this is here so as you can see down here this is the< the iron Condor structure you have the the iron Condor structure you have the put< put spread at the bottom and you have put spread at the bottom and you have the< the call spread at the top so as the the call spread at the top so as the market< market comes down here what is trying to market comes down here what is trying to aim< aim to profit is from this range down aim to profit is from this range down here< here in the middle right this is where here in the middle right this is where we're< we're going to make the profits so when we're going to make the profits so when you're< you're trading iron Condors we generally you're trading iron Condors we generally want< want an underlying that stays in a very want an underlying that stays in a very narrow< narrow range most of the time right so narrow range most of the time right so if< if you were to compare index ETFs and if you were to compare index ETFs and individual< individual stocks index ETFs would individual stocks index ETFs would actually< actually be the better underlying to actually be the better underlying to trade< trade a better vehicle to trade mainly trade a better vehicle to trade mainly because< because it's not as volatile as stocks because it's not as volatile as stocks right< right individual stocks are much more right individual stocks are much more volatile< volatile true you get much more premium volatile true you get much more premium but< but that's also because there's much but that's also because there's much more< more risk so to speak big in the terms more risk so to speak big in the terms of< of the movement of the underlying stocks of the movement of the underlying stocks right< right stocks because it's just a single right stocks because it's just a single stock< stock one big news right can really move stock one big news right can really move the< the stock in One Direction or the other the stock in One Direction or the other and< and that can easily Bridge you know one and that can easily Bridge you know one of< of the sides of your iron Condors right of the sides of your iron Condors right May< May Bridge the wings of your iron May Bridge the wings of your iron Condors< Condors which is not what we want Condors which is not what we want whereas< whereas index ETFs especially the whereas index ETFs especially the broad-based< broad-based index ETFs where they broad-based index ETFs where they consist< consist of you know many many different consist of you know many many different underlyings< underlyings inside of the index ETFs the underlyings inside of the index ETFs the chances< chances of it you know making such a big chances of it you know making such a big move< move based on one stocks news is is not move based on one stocks news is is not as< as huge as compared to the underlying or as huge as compared to the underlying or rather< rather a single stock so that is why for rather a single stock so that is why for I< I Condors if you want to have a better I Condors if you want to have a better chance< chance of winning the trade then you chance of winning the trade then you would< would want to go for the index ETFs now would want to go for the index ETFs now step< step number two once you've already step number two once you've already built< built a watch list of your index ETFs built a watch list of your index ETFs and< and individual stocks right preferably and individual stocks right preferably most< most of them are index ETFs this is most of them are index ETFs this is where< where you want to go through your charts where you want to go through your charts right< right the charts of each of the right the charts of each of the underlines< underlines that you have on your watch underlines that you have on your watch list< list and you want to identify the list and you want to identify the previous< previous highs and lows so this is what previous highs and lows so this is what you< you do you can go through every single you do you can go through every single chart< chart. and then you take a look at where chart and then you take a look at where the< the price is so let's say for example the price is so let's say for example down< down here you can see on the chart the down here you can see on the chart the price< price is somewhere around here right price is somewhere around here right this< this is where the current price is so this is where the current price is so what< what you want to do is find the previous what you want to do is find the previous high< high and then the previous low and then high and then the previous low and then you< you draw these lines across right so as you draw these lines across right so as you< you can see down here these are the you can see down here these are the lines< lines that kind of depicts the range of lines that kind of depicts the range of where< where you can build your iron Condor where you can build your iron Condor right< right so if the current market price is right so if the current market price is inside< inside of the previous highs and lows inside of the previous highs and lows this< this this will be the underlying to this this will be the underlying to place< place an iron Condor on and preferably place an iron Condor on and preferably where< where we want to have our strikes would where we want to have our strikes would be< be outside of this previous low and be outside of this previous low and previous< previous high right so again let me just previous high right so again let me just draw< draw out this is minus one + one so this draw out this is minus one + one so this is< is for the call side again now here this is for the call side again now here this will< will be minus one and + one on the put will be minus one and + one on the put side< side so the main reason why we want to side so the main reason why we want to identify< identify this highs and lows is that in identify this highs and lows is that in the< the event whereby you know the price do the event whereby you know the price do actually< actually trade up or maybe it trades all actually trade up or maybe it trades all the< the way down and it hits of this the way down and it hits of this previous< previous highs and lows it actually previous highs and lows it actually serves< serves as a kind of a support resistance serves as a kind of a support resistance right< right where the market could come back right where the market could come back up< up again if it bounces off this support up again if it bounces off this support and< and it could come back down again right and it could come back down again right if< if it bounces off this resistance so if it bounces off this resistance so making< making it a likelier chance a likelihood making it a likelier chance a likelihood that< that the market will stay within your that the market will stay within your Ion< Ion Condor range as you trade it now Ion Condor range as you trade it now step< step number three once you've already step number three once you've already identified< identified what is the underlying that identified what is the underlying that you< you want to trade on the next step would you want to trade on the next step would be< be to identify the DTE you want to use be to identify the DTE you want to use right< right so DTE is basically the expiration right so DTE is basically the expiration dates< dates and generally we want around the dates and generally we want around the 45< 45 DTE Mark to have a long-term 45 DTE Mark to have a long-term statistical< statistical Edge right so as you can see statistical Edge right so as you can see down< down here this is the option chain so as down here this is the option chain so as you< you can see you are faced with quite a you can see you are faced with quite a number< number of expiration dates to choose number of expiration dates to choose from< from and one of the things is that many from and one of the things is that many people< people like to go for the shorter term people like to go for the shorter term right< right they like to go for maybe zero DTE right they like to go for maybe zero DTE or< or maybe they like to go for the 7 DTE or maybe they like to go for the 7 DTE ones< ones or maybe some would go for 14 DTE ones or maybe some would go for 14 DTE which< which is 2 weeks and the reason why most which is 2 weeks and the reason why most people< people want to go for this shorter term people want to go for this shorter term trades< trades this shorter term DTE is because trades this shorter term DTE is because they< they want to realize the profit fast they want to realize the profit fast right< right because if zero tte just means right because if zero tte just means that< that at the end of the day you are able that at the end of the day you are able to< to realize a profit or a loss right they to realize a profit or a loss right they want< want a quick reinforcements of you know want a quick reinforcements of you know whether< whether you're going to be uh making whether you're going to be uh making money< money or losing money now why do I say money or losing money now why do I say that< that we want to go for the 45 DTE Mark that we want to go for the 45 DTE Mark instead< instead of those you know at a very instead of those you know at a very shorter< shorter term DTE well the main reason we shorter term DTE well the main reason we want< want to go for roughly around the 45 DT want to go for roughly around the 45 DT Mark< Mark is because of this statistical a so Mark is because of this statistical a so the< the main reason why we want to stick to the main reason why we want to stick to around< around the 45 DTE Mark is because this around the 45 DTE Mark is because this is< is the only time where the expected move is the only time where the expected move is< is bigger than the realized move so our is bigger than the realized move so our Edge< Edge when we are trading iron Condors Edge when we are trading iron Condors come< come in the fact that the realized move come in the fact that the realized move would< would be smaller than the expected move would be smaller than the expected move right< right so as you can see down here if we right so as you can see down here if we go< go for the 45 days DTE you can see that go for the 45 days DTE you can see that the< the expected move is bigger than the the expected move is bigger than the realized< realized move which means to say the realized move which means to say the realized< realized move the actual move in the realized move the actual move in the market< market is smaller than the theoretical market is smaller than the theoretical range< range by the mathematical model by which range by the mathematical model by which they< they price options that is why we want they price options that is why we want to< to go for the DTE whereby the realized to go for the DTE whereby the realized move< move is actually lesser than the move is actually lesser than the expected< expected move but if you take a look at expected move but if you take a look at the< the days that lesser than 45 DTE you the days that lesser than 45 DTE you notice< notice that the expected move is notice that the expected move is actually< actually not bigger than the realized actually not bigger than the realized move< move all right as you can see no no no move all right as you can see no no no and< and no so it's all no for anything under and no so it's all no for anything under 45< 45 days right you can see the expected 45 days right you can see the expected move< move which is basically the expected move which is basically the expected range< range for the 7-Day one is roughly 2 range for the 7-Day one is roughly 2 2. 1%< 2.

1% right but the realized move is 2. 2% 2.

1% right but the realized move is 2. 2% which< which means to say it's actually moving which means to say it's actually moving bigger< bigger than the realized move so when we bigger than the realized move so when we place< place our strikes we want to place our place our strikes we want to place our strikes< strikes roughly around the expected move strikes roughly around the expected move range< range right so let's say for example range right so let's say for example this< this is the expected range down here so this is the expected range down here so what< what we want to do is we will want to what we want to do is we will want to place< place our strik somewhere around here place our strik somewhere around here right< right so you will place your short right so you will place your short strikes< strikes here so this will be where your strikes here so this will be where your iron< iron Condor call spread is and this is iron Condor call spread is and this is where< where your iron Condor put spread is where your iron Condor put spread is right< right so we want to put it around where right so we want to put it around where the< the expected range is but this is the expected range is but this is telling< telling us that you know at 7 Days the telling us that you know at 7 Days the realized< realized move is actually bigger than realized move is actually bigger than the< the expected move which means to say the expected move which means to say that< that when the market actually moves it that when the market actually moves it could< could move past where our range are could move past where our range are right< right is where we place our short right is where we place our short strikes< strikes at which means to say we are not strikes at which means to say we are not going< going to make money on the iron Condor going to make money on the iron Condor we< we want to choose the DTE whereby the we want to choose the DTE whereby the range< range actually stays inside of this move range actually stays inside of this move down< down here right inside of where we chose down here right inside of where we chose our< our ion Condor strikes and this can can our ion Condor strikes and this can can only< only happen if we choose the DTE whereby only happen if we choose the DTE whereby the< the realized move is lesser than the the realized move is lesser than the expected< expected move which is why we want to expected move which is why we want to choose< choose 45 DTE now step number four once choose 45 DTE now step number four once you've< you've already identified the DTE that you've already identified the DTE that you< you want to choose to trade the iron you want to choose to trade the iron cond< cond on the next step is to identify cond on the next step is to identify your< your short leg strike price around the your short leg strike price around the expected< expected move based on Delta so as a expected move based on Delta so as a general< general rule of thumb is the lower the general rule of thumb is the lower the Delta< Delta that you choose for your short Delta that you choose for your short strikes< strikes for your iron Condor right the strikes for your iron Condor right the more< more conserv it is because you will have more conserv it is because you will have a< a larger profit Zone and the higher a larger profit Zone and the higher Delta< Delta it is slightly more aggressive but Delta it is slightly more aggressive but of< of course you get more premium as well of course you get more premium as well so< so it is just a trade-off there is no so it is just a trade-off there is no one< one that is better than the other it one that is better than the other it comes< comes down to you know which one you comes down to you know which one you feel< feel more comfortable with so as you can feel more comfortable with so as you can see< see on the left hand side down here this see on the left hand side down here this is< is the option chain but as you can see is the option chain but as you can see it's< it's pretty small so let me just it's pretty small so let me just increase< increase the size down here so you can increase the size down here so you can see< see it a little bit more clearly so when see it a little bit more clearly so when you< you open up the option chain you'll you open up the option chain you'll notice< notice that you know you have the calls notice that you know you have the calls on< on the left hand side and you have the on the left hand side and you have the put< put on the right hand side so this is put on the right hand side so this is where< where you want to start to construct where you want to start to construct your< your iron Condor so the first thing we your iron Condor so the first thing we want< want to do is to select our short want to do is to select our short strikes< strikes right that means we want to strikes right that means we want to choose< choose the short put strike and the choose the short put strike and the short< short call strike so how do you want to short call strike so how do you want to go< go about doing that and that is by go about doing that and that is by choosing< choosing the Delta that is around the choosing the Delta that is around the expected< expected move right so that will be the expected move right so that will be the range< range of roughly 16 to 20 Delta so this range of roughly 16 to 20 Delta so this is< is where we would want to place our iron is where we would want to place our iron Condor< Condor short strikes air now you might Condor short strikes air now you might be< be wondering why is it roughly 16 to 20 be wondering why is it roughly 16 to 20 Delta< Delta well the answer is because this is Delta well the answer is because this is where< where the expected move is roughly where the expected move is roughly around< around right so as you can see this is around right so as you can see this is another< another study done by the tasty trade another study done by the tasty trade team< team you can see over here it says one team you can see over here it says one side< side it says based on expected move side it says based on expected move formula< formula the other side it says based on formula the other side it says based on 16< 16 Delta options so the one that is 16 Delta options so the one that is based< based on expected move formula it will based on expected move formula it will show< show on your option chain on the top show on your option chain on the top right< right hand side by the way right uh I right hand side by the way right uh I don't< don't show it here mainly because right don't show it here mainly because right if< if I was to show that the picture will if I was to show that the picture will become< become too big everything else will become too big everything else will become< become you know very small hard to see become you know very small hard to see but< but it will be shown on the option chain but it will be shown on the option chain at< at the right hand side right it will at the right hand side right it will show< show a plus minus and some sort of show a plus minus and some sort of number< number at the right hand side so let's number at the right hand side so let's say< say maybe plus - 10 so it's telling you say maybe plus - 10 so it's telling you that< that the range is plus - 10 from where that the range is plus - 10 from where the< the current price is. right so let's say the current price is right so let's say for< for example if the current price as an for example if the current price as an example< example is 170 then the expected range example is 170 then the expected range would< would be from 180 to 160 right so this would be from 180 to 160 right so this is< is how you do it based on the expected is how you do it based on the expected move< move formula if you construct your iron move formula if you construct your iron Condor< Condor based on that now the other way Condor based on that now the other way and< and a simpler approach would be just and a simpler approach would be just using< using these 16 Delta options right so using these 16 Delta options right so all< all you have to do is just take a look all you have to do is just take a look at< at the Delta column on your option chain at the Delta column on your option chain and< and you just look for the 16 Delta and you just look for the 16 Delta options< options right so as you can see down options right so as you can see down here< here this is the 16 Delta so you want here this is the 16 Delta so you want anything< anything from 16 to 20 Deltas anything from 16 to 20 Deltas thereabouts< thereabouts we don't want too small of a thereabouts we don't want too small of a Delta< Delta because if the Delta becomes too Delta because if the Delta becomes too small< small you won't get that much premium small you won't get that much premium and< and your risk gets a little bit higher and your risk gets a little bit higher right< right so generally 16 to 20 Delta would right so generally 16 to 20 Delta would be< be good and the reason why we also want be good and the reason why we also want to< to choose the expected move again it to choose the expected move again it ties< ties back to the fact that ion condos ties back to the fact that ion condos will< will profit over the long term because will profit over the long term because of< of the statistical Edge that the of the statistical Edge that the realized< realized move is going to be lesser than realized move is going to be lesser than the< the expected move and again it has to be the expected move and again it has to be roughly< roughly around the 45 DTE Mark so from roughly around the 45 DTE Mark so from here< here as you can see the theoretical win here as you can see the theoretical win rate< rate as depicted by this uh word down rate as depicted by this uh word down here< here see expected occurrences within here see expected occurrences within range< range what it's trying to tell us is range what it's trying to tell us is that< that if you choose based on the 16 Delta that if you choose based on the 16 Delta options< options it will be roughly a theoretical options it will be roughly a theoretical win< win rate of 68% right so this is the win rate of 68% right so this is the expected< expected move expected range win rate expected move expected range win rate now< now as we already know if you choose the now as we already know if you choose the right< right DTE the realiz move is actually right DTE the realiz move is actually smaller< smaller than expected move which means smaller than expected move which means to< to say your win rate will actually be to say your win rate will actually be higher< higher in actual trading right so as you higher in actual trading right so as you can< can see down here this shows you what is can see down here this shows you what is the< the actual occurrences so as you can see the actual occurrences so as you can see down< down here it says actual occurrences down here it says actual occurrences within< within this uh expected move so if you within this uh expected move so if you were< were to see based on expected move were to see based on expected move formula< formula it says 85% and based on 16 formula it says 85% and based on 16 Delta< Delta is 71% so both of them as you can Delta is 71% so both of them as you can see< see is higher than the theoretical wind see is higher than the theoretical wind rate< rate and that is why we actually have an rate and that is why we actually have an edge< edge over the long term now one thing I edge over the long term now one thing I just< just want to point out is that this just want to point out is that this number< number 71% 85% should actually be number 71% 85% should actually be swapped< swapped and the reason is because the swapped and the reason is because the expected< expected move formula depicted by the expected move formula depicted by the number< number on the top right hand side of number on the top right hand side of your< your option chain is actually a smaller your option chain is actually a smaller range< range than the 16 Delta options right range than the 16 Delta options right most< most of the time if you were to go to most of the time if you were to go to your< your option chain and then you were to your option chain and then you were to just< just you know compare both of the ranges just you know compare both of the ranges right< right if you were to compare the range right if you were to compare the range of< of the expected based on this number of the expected based on this number down< down here maybe the range will be down here maybe the range will be somewhere< somewhere like this right so from here somewhere like this right so from here to< to here this will be the range and if to here this will be the range and if you< you were to compare it with the 16 Delta you were to compare it with the 16 Delta options< options you will see that the 16 Delta options you will see that the 16 Delta options< options most often most of the time is options most often most of the time is actually< actually much bigger than the expected actually much bigger than the expected range< range calculation based on this number range calculation based on this number so< so that is why this number should so that is why this number should actually< actually be swapped right so that is why actually be swapped right so that is why the< the 16 Delta options actually give you a the 16 Delta options actually give you a higher< higher win rate than you actually higher win rate than you actually theoretically< theoretically should be having Next Step theoretically should be having Next Step number< number five once you have already number five once you have already identified< identified your short leg strike prices identified your short leg strike prices the< the next one to do is to identify your the next one to do is to identify your wings< wings right where

com blueprint all right back with davis. com blueprint all right back to< to the video so the way you want to do to the video so the way you want to do it< it is based on the risk that you it is based on the risk that you actually< actually plan to risk for the trade so actually plan to risk for the trade so let's< let's say for example your risk per let's say for example your risk per trade< trade is $500 right that means to say trade is $500 right that means to say you< you want to construct an iron Condor you want to construct an iron Condor where< where the most you can lose is $500 you where the most you can lose is $500 you don't< don't want anything that exceeds that so don't want anything that exceeds that so the< the first step you want to do to create the first step you want to do to create your< your iron Condor Wings would be to just your iron Condor Wings would be to just go< go with the width that corresponds to go with the width that corresponds to your< your max Max risk so as you can see down your max Max risk so as you can see down here< here Max risk is $500 so you just go here Max risk is $500 so you just go with< with a $5 width on both sides right you with a $5 width on both sides right you construct< construct a $5 width on your call spread construct a $5 width on your call spread side< side and a $5 WID on your put side this side and a $5 WID on your put side this is< is a way to just get started just to put is a way to just get started just to put your< your iron Condor strikes on the option your iron Condor strikes on the option chain< chain and then from there we will adjust chain and then from there we will adjust right< right so let's say for example you put right so let's say for example you put on< on this iron Condor with a $5 white so on this iron Condor with a $5 white so by< by the way you have already chosen the by the way you have already chosen the Delta< Delta let's say maybe you have chosen Delta let's say maybe you have chosen the< the 18 Delta for the short call and also the 18 Delta for the short call and also the< the 18 Delta for the short put side so the 18 Delta for the short put side so we've< we've already got these short strikes we've already got these short strikes figured< figured out the next is our long Wings figured out the next is. our long Wings right< right the wings would be the plus one right the wings would be the plus one call< call and the plus one put so we want it call and the plus one put so we want it to< to be $5 away from where the short to be $5 away from where the short strikes< strikes are so let's say for example if strikes are so let's say for example if the< the short strike on the call side let's the short strike on the call side let's say< say is say is $180< $180 so this is where you want to take $180 so this is where you want to take $5< $5 add on to this so your wings will be $5 add on to this so your wings will be 185< 185 and let's say on the bottom side 185 and let's say on the bottom side let's< let's say say for example it's let's say say for example it's $160< $160 for your shut strike then you want $160 for your shut strike then you want to< to take $5 away so this will be at $155 to take $5 away so this will be at $155 so< so this is how you construct your so this is how you construct your initial< initial iron Condor trade so once you initial iron Condor trade so once you have< have constructed this you should be able have constructed this you should be able to< to get the premium so let's say for to get the premium so let's say for example< example the premium is example the premium is $125< $125 that means you're going to receive $125 that means you're going to receive $125< $125 for every one contract of the iron $125 for every one contract of the iron Condor< Condor that you put on now how do you Condor that you put on now how do you calculate< calculate what is the max risk so calculate what is the max risk so generally< generally on the platform it should tell generally on the platform it should tell you< you what is the max risk right but if you what is the max risk right but if you< you want to know exactly how it's you want to know exactly how it's calculated< calculated it's actually pretty simple calculated it's actually pretty simple right< right first of all you just take the right first of all you just take the maximum< maximum width of the wings so as you can maximum width of the wings so as you can see< see down here this $5 so you just take see down here this $5 so you just take $5< $5 minus off the premium and you get $5 minus off the premium and you get $3.

75< $3. 75 so this is your maximum loss that $3.

75 so this is your maximum loss that you< you can lose on this trade so again you can lose on this trade so again based< based on one contract of the in condol based on one contract of the in condol is is is $375< $375 per contract so at this point of $375 per contract so at this point of time< time you've already constructed your in time you've already constructed your in in< in Condor and you you notice that you in Condor and you you notice that you know< know you still have some room to know you still have some room to increase< increase the risk of your trade right increase the risk of your trade right because< because the max RIS you have already because the max RIS you have already decided< decided is $500 but this construct gives decided is $500 but this construct gives you< you a Max race of 375 so you want to try you a Max race of 375 so you want to try and< and increase this so at the same time and increase this so at the same time you< you can also get slightly more premium you can also get slightly more premium so< so how do you actually increase this um so how do you actually increase this um risk< risk down here so the way you want to do risk down here so the way you want to do it< it is just by simply adjusting your long it is just by simply adjusting your long strike< strike prices right so previously you strike prices right so previously you were< were at $5 so you want to just increase were at $5 so you want to just increase it< it by another dollar or another strike it by another dollar. or another strike price< price and you just see right from here price and you just see right from here what< what is the kind of Maximum Breeze here what is the kind of Maximum Breeze here so< so let's say for example you've so let's say for example you've increased< increased to $6 wide on both sides again increased to $6 wide on both sides again it's< it's very important that for you as a it's very important that for you as a beginner< beginner to trading iron Condors you beginner to trading iron Condors you want< want to trade iron Condors with even want to trade iron Condors with even Wings< Wings on both sides first once you get a Wings on both sides first once you get a little< little bit more experience then you can little bit more experience then you can go< go for a skewed iron Condor you know go for a skewed iron Condor you know whereby< whereby you know one side might be whereby you know one side might be bigger< bigger than the other but as a start bigger than the other but as a start just< just keep them the same all right so just keep them the same all right so let's< let's say we keep it to $6 WID on both let's say we keep it to $6 WID on both sides< sides so this is where you start to sides so this is where you start to calculate< calculate what is the max risk again all calculate what is the max risk again all right< right so again you should see that your right so again you should see that your premium< premium would have increase so in this premium would have increase so in this case< case he has increased to $1. 50 so this case he has increased to $1.

50 so this is< is how you calculate your max risk on is how you calculate your max risk on the< the trade again you take the width of the trade again you take the width of the< the wings so as you can see $6 minus the wings so as you can see $6 minus $150< $150 it becomes $450 which is $150 it becomes $450 which is $450< $450 per contract so as you can see down $450 per contract so as you can see down here< here you pretty much hit you know very here you pretty much hit you know very close< close to 500 and I would say this is close to 500 and I would say this is more< more than good enough for you to put on more than good enough for you to put on the< the this trade now step number six once the this trade now step number six once you< you have already gotten this ion condol you have already gotten this ion condol structure< structure out this is where you want to structure out this is where you want to start< start to send this order in and get start to send this order in and get executed< executed on this trade so the way you executed on this trade so the way you want< want to do it is by placing a limit want to do it is by placing a limit order< order right you always want to place a order right you always want to place a limit< limit order on your iron Condor so that limit order on your iron Condor so that you< you can control the price at which you you can control the price at which you get< get in right you can control the premium get in right you can control the premium which< which you get so as you can see over which you get so as you can see over here< here this is the tasty trade platform here this is the tasty trade platform the< the tasty trade platform will show you. the tasty trade platform will show you what< what is the credit that you want to get what is the credit that you want to get that< that you place for the iron Condor so that you place for the iron Condor so let's< let's say for example it's at $138 now let's say for example it's at $138 now you< you notice below there is this range you notice below there is this range down< down here on the left hand side it says down here on the left hand side it says net< net Nat which is the natural what it net Nat which is the natural what it means< means is that this is the natural price means is that this is the natural price that< that you will immediately get fued at if that you will immediately get fued at if you< you put it at that price right as you you put it at that price right as you can< can see it's can see it's $132< $132 and in the middle it says mid so $132 and in the middle it says mid so this< this is the middle medium price at this is the middle medium price at $136< $136 and on the right hand side it gives $136 and on the right hand side it gives you< you you know uh the other end of the you you know uh the other end of the price< price which is at price which is at $141< $141 so generally when we put on the $141 so generally when we put on the limit< limit order we want to try and get you limit order we want to try and get you know< know as good of a price as we can as know as good of a price as we can as good< good as a fi as we can because first of good as a fi as we can because first of all< all we already know for sure we can get all we already know for sure we can get Fu< Fu at Fu at $1. 32< $1.

32 but we might want to get slightly $1. 32 but we might want to get slightly more< more credit right because every cent more credit right because every cent equals< equals to a doll in premium that you equals to a doll in premium that you receive< receive so if you see that the meat is receive so if you see that the meat is a136< a136 what I generally like to do is just a136 what I generally like to do is just to< to increase it by a couple of cents to increase it by a couple of cents right< right to the right hand side to just get right to the right hand side to just get slightly< slightly more premium than what the mle slightly more premium than what the mle price< price is Indica in so in this case I price is Indica in so in this case I would< would just put $138 in and then just see would just put $138 in and then just see you< you know whether I can get fi right you know whether I can get fi right sometimes< sometimes you could get fi sometimes you sometimes you could get fi sometimes you won't< won't get Fu also don't forget that the won't get Fu also don't forget that the market< market is always moving up and down so market is always moving up and down so as< as the market is moving this medium as the market is moving this medium price< price will keep changing as well right price will keep changing as well right so< so it might actually move the medium so it might actually move the medium price< price might actually move up to become price might actually move up to become 138< 138 and you could get fill then or on 138 and you could get fill then or on the< the other hand it could move down as the other hand it could move down as well< well so it keeps moving it keeps well so it keeps moving it keeps changing< changing this is one thing you have to changing this is one thing you have to keep< keep in mind so let's say for example keep in mind so let's say for example you're< you're putting at $138 and you notice you're putting at $138 and you notice that< that you're not filled and you do want that you're not filled and you do want to< to get fill right so your prerogative is to get fill right so your prerogative is that< that you want to get fill on the trade that you want to get fill on the trade rather< rather than just get you know the the rather than just get you know the the kind< kind of a premium that you're just kind of a premium that you're just waiting< waiting for and you're willing to let go waiting for and you're willing to let go of< of the trade if you don't get the of the trade if you don't get the premium< premium right that's another way you can premium right that's another way you can do< do it but let's say you want to get Fu do it but let's say you want to get Fu then< then this is where you want to inch down then this is where you want to inch down your< your price your limit order slowly your price your limit order slowly downwards< downwards until you're able to find the downwards until you're able to find the FI< FI price right so basically this is what FI price right so basically this is what you< you call Price Discovery where you just you call Price Discovery where you just adjust< adjust your limit price order a bit by a adjust your limit price order a bit by a bit< bit each time to see whether you get F bit each time to see whether you get F so< so for example what I'll do is I'll put so for example what I'll do is I'll put it< it at it at $138< $138 and I'll just wait for a few $138 and I'll just wait for a few seconds< seconds right maybe 30 seconds or seconds right maybe 30 seconds or something< something like that and if I do not get something like that and if I do not get fill< fill what I'll do is I'll adjust it fill what I'll do is I'll adjust it again< again right I'll adjust it down now to again right I'll adjust it down now to $136< $136 and see whether I get Fu now let's $136 and see whether I get Fu now let's say< say for example at $136 I don't get Fu say for example at $136 I don't get Fu and< and I really do want to get Fu then I and I really do want to get Fu then I will< will adjust it again I will move it down will adjust it again I will move it down $134< $134 so at this time you notice that the $134 so at this time you notice that the mid< mid price have shifted down right the mid price have shifted down right the mid< mid price have shifted down from $136 to mid price have shifted down from $136 to $135< $135 which means to say it becomes a $135 which means to say it becomes a little< little bit harder for me to get fill at little bit harder for me to get fill at the< the price which I want so again I will the price which I want so again I will try< try and adjust it and adjust it until try and adjust it and adjust it until finally< finally I get fil all right so this is finally I get fil all right so this is the< the way that you want to do it as well the way that you want to do it as well uh< uh you want to use the price Discovery uh you want to use the price Discovery method< method at the start where you inch it method at the start where you inch it down< down rather than you immediately get the down rather than you immediately get the natural< natural price because the natural price natural price because the natural price most< most of the time will be the worst price most of the time will be the worst price that< that you can get now finally step seven that you can get now finally step seven now< now step step seven this is where you now step step seven this is where you want< want to plan your exit scenarios and in want to plan your exit scenarios and in my< my opinion this is the most important my opinion this is the most important step< step because you need to know what to do step because you need to know what to do once< once you've already got your trade in once you've already got your trade in right< right many times you'll be surprised right many times you'll be surprised that< that I get people emailing me showing me that I get people emailing me showing me their< their positions and most of the time their positions and most of the time these< these positions are losing a lot of these positions are losing a lot of money< money right they are deep in the money money right they are deep in the money and< and they're going to ask me you know and they're going to ask me you know Davis< Davis how can I Salvage this position so Davis how can I Salvage this position so my< my take is that if you can put yourself my take is that if you can put yourself in< in a position where you have to ask me in a position where you have to ask me then< then you shouldn't be in the trade in then you shouldn't be in the trade in the< the first place because you should the first place because you should already< already know upfront beforehand when already know upfront beforehand when you're< you're going to get out of the trade all you're going to get out of the trade all right< right so I'm going to give you a few right so I'm going to give you a few different< different ways that you can get out of different ways that you can get out of the< the trade so the way you want to exit a the trade so the way you want to exit a trade< trade would either first of all be based trade would either first of all be based on< on a fixed takeprofit price so let's say on a fixed takeprofit price so let's say for< for example 50% winner so as you can see for example 50% winner so as you can see down< down here this is done by the tasty down here this is done by the tasty trade< trade team where they compare three trade team where they compare three different< different exit points right you can exit different exit points right you can exit at< at expiration exit at 50% winner and at expiration exit at 50% winner and exit< exit at 21 DTE so 21 DTE just means exit at 21 DTE so 21 DTE just means there's< there's 21 days left left to expiration there's 21 days left left to expiration not< not 21 days in a trade right just to not 21 days in a trade right just to make< make it clear so for example if you put make it clear so for example if you put on< on the trade at 51 DTE you have to wait on the trade at 51 DTE you have to wait 30< 30 days before it becomes 21 DTE okay so 30 days before it becomes 21 DTE okay so based< based on this table down here as you can based on this table down here as you can see< see exiting at 50% winner and exiting see exiting at 50% winner and exiting when< when it's at 21 DTE will have a better when it's at 21 DTE will have a better performance< performance than if you were to exit at performance than if you were to exit at expiration< expiration so you want to choose either expiration so you want to choose either one< one of these two or a combination of one of these two or a combination of both< both of them so the 50% winner has a both of them so the 50% winner has a higher< higher win rate mainly because whenever higher win rate mainly because whenever it< it reaches 50% you quickly take the it reaches 50% you quickly take the profit< profit off right and that can happen profit off right and that can happen quite< quite often whereas on 21 DTE you have a quite often whereas on 21 DTE you have a slightly< slightly lower win rate because even slightly lower win rate because even though< though it has already reached 50% take though it has already reached 50% take profit< profit you might still just hold on to profit you might still just hold on to the< the trade and that trade could possibly the trade and that trade could possibly still< still turn out to be a loser when you still turn out to be a loser when you could< could have taken off at 50% uh take could have taken off at 50% uh take profit< profit but. at the end of the day you profit but at the end of the day you notice< notice what's important is this daily notice what's important is this daily p&amp;l< p&amp;l right which means to say this is the p&amp;l right which means to say this is the average< average p&amp;l that you get on a daily average p&amp;l that you get on a daily basis< basis and you can you can see based on basis and you can you can see based on 21< 21 DTE you actually get a higher pnl and 21 DTE you actually get a higher pnl and the< the reason is because at 21 DTE you the reason is because at 21 DTE you could< could actually make maybe 80% of the could actually make maybe 80% of the premium< premium that you receive or maybe 90% of premium that you receive or maybe 90% of the< the premium receive right so you average the premium receive right so you average it< it all out you tend to get a slightly uh it all out you tend to get a slightly uh higher< higher p&amp;l than the 50% winner so which higher p&amp;l than the 50% winner so which is< is better I would say that there is not is better I would say that there is not one< one that is better because both have the one that is better because both have the pros< pros and cons so as you can see down pros and cons so as you can see down here< here based on 50% winner the pros is here based on 50% winner the pros is that< that you have a high win rate which that you have a high win rate which means< means to say you're going to experience means to say you're going to experience more< more winners so if you're the kind of more winners so if you're the kind of person< person that likes to keep winning then person that likes to keep winning then you< you might choose the 50% winner take you might choose the 50% winner take profit< profit and the cons is that you have no profit and the cons is that you have no loss< loss control so no loss control means loss control so no loss control means that< that if you do not hit the 50% winner that if you do not hit the 50% winner you< you might just leave it all the way to you might just leave it all the way to expiration< expiration which could be the max loss expiration which could be the max loss now< now whereas for 21 DTE the pros is that now whereas for 21 DTE the pros is that you< you have a lower volatility because when you have a lower volatility because when you< you cut off the trade at 21 DTE you very you cut off the trade at 21 DTE you very very< very rarely very very seldom actually very rarely very very seldom actually hit< hit the max loss on the trade right in hit the max loss on the trade right in fact< fact most of the time you won't hit the fact most of the time you won't hit the max< max loss because you're cutting it off max loss because you're cutting it off well< well before it reach just that point well before it reach just that point right< right the cons is that the p&amp;l is pretty right the cons is that the p&amp;l is pretty random< random because you won't know where the random because you won't know where the pnl< pnl is going to be at 21 DTE so the pnl is going to be at 21 DTE so the other< other alternative would be to do a combo other alternative would be to do a combo right< right the combo which means to say you right the combo which means to say you do< do both the 50% takeprofit or the 21 DTE do both the 50% takeprofit or the 21 DTE whichever< whichever comes first right so if it whichever comes first right so if it doesn't< doesn't get to the 50% takeprofit point doesn't get to the 50% takeprofit point before< before 21 DTE at 21 DTE you want to just before 21 DTE at 21 DTE you want to just exit< exit the trade right even though it's a exit the trade right even though it's a loss< loss so one thing to really understand loss so one thing to really understand about< about trading iron Condors is that this about trading iron Condors is that this is< is not one of those 99% or 100% win rate is not one of those 99% or 100% win rate where< where everybody is talking about right where everybody is talking about right iron< iron Condor you will win most of the iron Condor you will win most of the time< time but there are still times you're time but there are still times you're going< going to lose so this is very important going to lose so this is very important to< to understand so as you can see down to understand so as you can see down here< here this is again another study done by here this is again another study done by the< the tasty trade team and you can see the tasty trade team and you can see down< down here this is based on the 20 Delta down here this is based on the 20 Delta $10< $10 white iron Condor so the way they $10 white iron Condor so the way they conducted< conducted this study is by simply conducted this study is by simply putting< putting it on and whenever it reach putting it on and whenever it reach expiration< expiration they put on another one and expiration they put on another one and for< for the 21 DTE whenever it reaches 21 for the 21 DTE whenever it reaches 21 DTE< DTE they close it and then they put it DTE they close it and then they put it on< on again so for both of these two trades on again so for both of these two trades right< right the exit at expiration exit at 21 right the exit at expiration exit at 21 DTE< DTE both are actually profitable over DTE both are actually profitable over the< the long term as you can see the study the long term as you can see the study is< is somewhere from 2007 all the way to is somewhere from 2007 all the way to maybe< maybe past 2017 maybe maybe past 2017 maybe 2018< 2018 but the thing is that you can see 2018 but the thing is that you can see that< that 21 DTE has the much more Superior that 21 DTE has the much more Superior performance< performance because from 2011 onwards performance because from 2011 onwards all< all the way to you know wherever the all the way to you know wherever the study< study stopped somewhere around 2018 you study stopped somewhere around 2018 you can< can see that if you hold all the way to can see that if you hold all the way to expiration< expiration you actually have you know a expiration you actually have you know a pretty< pretty bad performance whereas the one pretty bad performance whereas the one at< at 21 DTE you still keep profiting and at 21 DTE you still keep profiting and the< the grph just keeps going up right so the grph just keeps going up right so either< either 21 DTE or 50% take profit or either 21 DTE or 50% take profit or combination< combination of both will be good here so combination of both will be good here so one< one thing I want you to look at is also one thing I want you to look at is also that< that you notice that this graph there that you notice that this graph there are< are times where it comes down right over are times where it comes down right over here< here so these are points where there here so these are points where there will< will be strings of losses and this is will be strings of losses and this is where< where you're going to get you know where you're going to get you know losing< losing trades as again I told you before losing trades as again I told you before in< in many of my other videos that iron in many of my other videos that iron Condor< Condor if you place it on the expected Condor if you place it on the expected move< move range is roughly around 65% win move range is roughly around 65% win rate< rate right which means to say there's rate right which means to say there's also< also a chance that 35% of the time also a chance that 35% of the time you're< you're going to lose it so you do not you're going to lose it so you do not want< want to force it where about every want to force it where about every single< single trade is going to winner you just single trade is going to winner you just want< want to play it out so as you can see want to play it out so as you can see based< based on this studies they made it very based on this studies they made it very objective< objective they just let the statistic objective they just let the statistic play< play out right put it on the trade based play out right put it on the trade based on< on the mechanics at 21 DTE they exited on the mechanics at 21 DTE they exited and< and they just keept doing this repeat and they just keept doing this repeat and< and rinsing this over time and as you and rinsing this over time and as you can< can see as long as you keep doing this can see as long as you keep doing this even< even though they are losers over the even though they are losers over the long< long term you can still be profitable long term you can still be profitable all< all right guys so this is the seventh all right guys so this is the seventh step< step ey in cond trading plan and if you step ey in cond trading plan and if you like< like this video I'll greatly appreciate like this video I'll greatly appreciate it< it if you give me a thumbs up by the way it if you give me a thumbs up by the way if< if you

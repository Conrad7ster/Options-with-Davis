Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we< we are going to be talking about the we are going to be talking about the safest< safest option selling strategy for safest option selling strategy for beginners< beginners so what do I think is the beginners so what do I think is the safest< safest option selling strategy well in safest option selling strategy well in my< my humble opinion that is the put broken my humble opinion that is the put broken wing< wing butterfly now for those of you who wing butterfly now for those of you who are< are new to options trading you might be are new to options trading you might be wondering< wondering why is there an insect down wondering why is there an insect down here< here and on top of that why does it have here and on top of that why does it have a< a broken wing what exactly is this a broken wing what exactly is this broken< broken wing butterfly well guys now for broken wing butterfly well guys now for this< this I have to bring you to this picture this I have to bring you to this picture over< over here and guys welcome to the over here and guys welcome to the Discovery< Discovery Channel we are looking at a Discovery Channel we are looking at a beautiful< beautiful magnificent insect beautiful beautiful magnificent insect beautiful magnificent< magnificent creature that is the magnificent creature that is the butterfly< butterfly right the butterfly has two butterfly right the butterfly has two supposedly< supposedly even wings but for the supposedly even wings but for the purpose< purpose of us option Traders the options purpose of us option Traders the options naming< naming committee decided to break apart naming committee decided to break apart one< one of those wings for our benefit and one of those wings for our benefit and they< they decided to call this strategy the they decided to call this strategy the broken< broken wing butterfly so guys please broken wing butterfly so guys please give< give it up to the sadists at the options give it up to the sadists at the options naming< naming committee for giving us this naming committee for giving us this wonderful< wonderful strategy that is in wonderful strategy that is in resemblance< resemblance to an insect that is resemblance to an insect that is obviously< obviously full of hurt and obviously full of hurt and pain< pain okay guys so let's get to Serious pain okay guys so let's get to Serious Business< Business down here so what exactly is Business down here so what exactly is the< the put broking butterfly so this is the the put broking butterfly so this is the put< put broken wing butterfly down here now put broken wing butterfly down here now why< why is it named that the put broken wing why is it named that the put broken wing butterfly< butterfly I mean you tell me right so butterfly I mean you tell me right so this< this is a broken wing butterfly this is a broken wing butterfly obviously< obviously it's been injured does it have obviously it's been injured does it have any< any resemblance to this strategy over any resemblance to this strategy over down< down here I don't know man you tell me down here I don't know man you tell me but< but I think that the options naming but I think that the options naming committee< committee could you know be a little bit committee could you know be a little bit more< more tactful right why do you want to more tactful right why do you want to call< call it a broken wing butterfly maybe call it a broken wing butterfly maybe just< just an uneven Wing or maybe a wing that just an uneven Wing or maybe a wing that is< is you know flapping one is higher than is you know flapping one is higher than the< the other anyway guys let's get into the the other anyway guys let's get into the options< options part of things let's get down to options part of things let's get down to business< business so what exactly is the put business so what exactly is the put broken< broken wing butterfly now the put broken broken wing butterfly now the put broken wing< wing butterfly consists of two wing butterfly consists of two strategies< strategies so the first is the put strategies so the first is the put credit< credit spread also known as The Bull put credit spread also known as The Bull put spread< spread so as you can see on the left spread so as you can see on the left hand< hand side down here let me just box hand side down here let me just box things< things off down here so just imagine things off down here so just imagine down< down here this is the put credit spread down here this is the put credit spread right< right so supposedly you would have one right so supposedly you would have one put< put down here put down here and< and then you have one long put down here and then you have one long put down here so< so this would be the put credit spread so this would be the put credit spread now< now on the other side you have the put now on the other side you have the put debit< debit spread so as you can see down here debit spread so as you can see down here you< you have two opposing strategies joined you have two opposing strategies joined together< together because the put credit spread together because the put credit spread is< is a bullish strategy and the put debit is a bullish strategy and the put debit spread< spread is a bearish strategy so one spread is a bearish strategy so one strategy< strategy wants it to go up the other strategy wants it to go up the other strategy< strategy wants it to go down you combine strategy wants it to go down you combine it< it you get this structure down here so it you get this structure down here so as< as you can see on the right hand side as you can see on the right hand side down< down here this will be where the put down here this will be where the put debit< debit spread is and to have this put debit spread is and to have this put broken< broken wing structure you need to have broken wing structure you need to have both< both of the short put at the same strike both of the short put at the same strike down< down here all right so let me just down here all right so let me just remove< remove the drawings down here so you remove the drawings down here so you notice< notice both of them will have the same notice both of them will have the same short< short putut strike so you combine this short putut strike so you combine this together< together you have the put broker wing together you have the put broker wing butterfly< butterfly and the idea here is to use butterfly and the idea here is to use the< the premium received from the put credit the premium received from the put credit spread< spread to finance the put debit spread spread to finance the put debit spread right< right so basically when you sell the put right so basically when you sell the put credit< credit spread you receive a premium and credit spread you receive a premium and using< using this premium you use it to using this premium you use it to purchase< purchase the put debit spread so let me purchase the put debit spread so let me give< give you an example down here so imagine give you an example down here so imagine you< you sell the put credit spread for a15 you sell the put credit spread for a15 right< right so this is on the left hand side right so this is on the left hand side down< down here so you sell it you receive a down here so you sell it you receive a premium< premium of a15 and then to purchase the premium of a15 and then to purchase the put< put debit spread on the right hand side put debit spread on the right hand side down< down here it'll be 75 cents so you minus down here it'll be 75 cents so you minus off< off the 75 cents and you net them off off the 75 cents and you net them off you< you actually get a credit of 30 cents so you actually get a credit of 30 cents so if< if you will take a look at this uh p&amp;l if you will take a look at this uh p&amp;l graph< graph down here let me just remove move graph down here let me just remove move this< this drawings down here you notice that this drawings down here you notice that this< this is the0 line that means anything this is the0 line that means anything above< above here you'll be in a profit above here you'll be in a profit anything< anything below the zero line You'll Be anything below the zero line You'll Be in< in a loss so you notice on the right in a loss so you notice on the right hand< hand side down here there is a small hand side down here there is a small profit< profit down here so this small profit profit down here so this small profit down< down here basically is this 30 cents down here basically is this 30 cents down< down here right so basically with one down here right so basically with one put< put broken wing butterfly structure down put broken wing butterfly structure down here< here that is $30 right so even though here that is $30 right so even though the< the market goes up you're still. going to the market goes up you're still going to make< make some money right so most of the make some money right so most of the time< time when we conru the put brokering time when we conru the put brokering butterfly< butterfly we want to construct it away butterfly we want to construct it away from< from where the current market price is from where the current market price is so< so as you can see down here I've marked so as you can see down here I've marked where< where the current price is and this is where the current price is and this is where< where you can construct this put broken where you can construct this put broken wing< wing butterfly whereby you know if the wing butterfly whereby you know if the market< market actually goes down you can market actually goes down you can actually< actually profit right if it actually you actually profit right if it actually you know< know pins the short strike at expiration know pins the short strike at expiration then< then this is where you can get the max then this is where you can get the max profit< profit so in a sense this is a little profit so in a sense this is a little bit< bit like a defensive strategy but then bit like a defensive strategy but then of< of course you know you can just change of course you know you can just change it< it however you like right because this it however you like right because this uh< uh whole whole structure down here can uh whole whole structure down here can be< be manipulated based on you know where be manipulated based on you know where you< you want it to be right for example if you want it to be right for example if you're< you're a little bit more bullish you can you're a little bit more bullish you can just< just shift this whole thing down here so just shift this whole thing down here so the< the whole tent down here would actually the whole tent down here would actually shift< shift up like this all right so I call shift up like this all right so I call this< this structure this triangle down here this structure this triangle down here the< the tent so this gives us you know the the tent so this gives us you know the image< image of where our Max profit is going image of where our Max profit is going to< to be now at the same time you know if to be now at the same time you know if you're< you're a little bit more bearish you you're a little bit more bearish you want< want it be more defensive you can want it be more defensive you can actually< actually shift it more to the left hand actually shift it more to the left hand side< side right so the graph itself will be side right so the graph itself will be shifted< shifted more to the left hand side so shifted more to the left hand side so just< just imagine it will look something like just imagine it will look something like this< this okay so as you can see the way you this okay so as you can see the way you want< want to you know construct this really want to you know construct this really comes< comes down to your take of the underline comes down to your take of the underline so< so let's say for example you are afraid so let's say for example you are afraid that< that the market is going to go down you that the market is going to go down you think< think you know it may have a very steep think you know it may have a very steep decline< decline or even a crash then you could decline or even a crash then you could actually< actually structure this whole thing you actually structure this whole thing you know< know to much further down right all the know to much further down right all the way< way down at the same time if you don't way down at the same time if you don't think< think it's going to go that down but think it's going to go that down but then< then again you you you want to kind of then again you you you want to kind of get< get some chance to actually hit the max get some chance to actually hit the max profit< profit then you might want to shift profit then you might want to shift closer< closer to where this current market closer to where this current market price< price is so again it's very versatile price is so again it's very versatile it's< it's up to you you know how you want to it's up to you you know how you want to construct< construct it now for those of you who construct it now for those of you who are< are much more visual inclined you want are much more visual inclined you want to< to see how it looks like on the chart to see how it looks like on the chart then< then this is how it actually looks like then this is how it actually looks like right< right so as you can see down here this right so as you can see down here this portion< portion down here is where the max portion down here is where the max profit< profit lies or rather this is where the profit lies or rather this is where the ten< ten is right so I put the tenth word ten is right so I put the tenth word down< down here so the short strike down here down here so the short strike down here is< is where you actually get your max is where you actually get your max profit< profit so if we go back to the previous profit so if we go back to the previous chart< chart down here you can see this is chart down here you can see this is where< where the Pinnacle is right the height where the Pinnacle is right the height of< of where this put broken wing butterfly of where this put broken wing butterfly profit< profit is you see the minus two put down profit is you see the minus two put down here< here and if I was to go to the Chart here and if I was to go to the Chart again< again you can see it's actually down again you can see it's actually down here< here and you will see from down here here and you will see from down here this< this point all the way to here this is this point all the way to here this is the< the 10th again like I mentioned this is the 10th again like I mentioned this is the< the 10th version down here and anything the 10th version down here and anything above< above this uh long put down here this is above this uh long put down here this is where< where you make the minimum Min profit where you make the minimum Min profit right< right the minimum profit as you can see right the minimum profit as you can see down< down here right from here onwards this down here right from here onwards this is< is where you make the minimum profit so is where you make the minimum profit so it< it all comes down to how much you sold it all comes down to how much you sold this< this uh put broking butterfly 4 you this uh put broking butterfly 4 you receive< receive you know just keep the credit receive you know just keep the credit for< for it now at the bottom down here this for it now at the bottom down here this is< is where you start to you know have your is where you start to you know have your losses< losses increase right so if you were losses increase right so if you were take< take the look at the graph again down take the look at the graph again down here< here this p&amp;l graph this is this portion here this p&amp;l graph this is this portion over< over here right so this portion over over here right so this portion over here< here you notice depending on where it is here you notice depending on where it is your< your losses will start to get you know your losses will start to get you know big< big Bigg ger and bigger you know as it big Bigg ger and bigger you know as it starts< starts to go past uh this point on on starts to go past uh this point on on down< down here right you can see down here down here right you can see down here this< this is where the break even is so this is where the break even is so anything< anything past this point your losses get anything past this point your losses get bigger< bigger and bigger until to this point bigger and bigger until to this point this< this is where it's being kept right this is where it's being kept right because< because this is a defined RIS strategy because this is a defined RIS strategy you< you already know what is your maximum you already know what is your maximum loss< loss up front so that is not to say that loss up front so that is not to say that although< although I think this is the safest you although I think this is the safest you know< know option selling strategy that you know option selling strategy that you won't< won't lose money right of course not won't lose money right of course not there< there will always be a chance that you there will always be a chance that you lose< lose money because again let's look back lose money because again let's look back to< to this to this you< you can see down here it says 87. 0 6% you can see down here it says 87.

0 6% which< which means this is the win rate but which means this is the win rate but there's< there's also roughly a 133% chance that there's also roughly a 133% chance that you< you could still lose money right so you you could still lose money right so you have< have to bear in mind that there is no have to bear in mind that there is no strategy< strategy that you will always win all strategy that you will always win all the< the time right at some time sooner or the time right at some time sooner or later< later as long as you trade this strategy later as long as you trade this strategy long< long enough you're bound to hit losers long enough you're bound to hit losers as< as well but as long as you place this as well but as long as you place this consistently< consistently over time and you use the consistently over time and you use the right< right mechanics then you will still have right mechanics then you will still have the< the edge uh after many many many trades the edge uh after many many many trades now< now down here as you can see this is now down here as you can see this is where< where you start to hit the max loss where you start to hit the max loss right< right Max loss is past this long put right Max loss is past this long put strike< strike down here that means to say if strike down here that means to say if the< the market really crashes all the way the market really crashes all the way down< down you do not lose any more than you down you do not lose any more than you know< know what you have already risked for know what you have already risked for this< this uh trade down here so in this case this uh trade down here so in this case down< down here just for this trade I've set down here just for this trade I've set one< one up that the max loss is roughly one up that the max loss is roughly about< about 500 plus right so even though if about 500 plus right so even though if the< the market crashes all the way to zero the market crashes all the way to zero the< the most you can lose is up to where you the most you can lose is up to where you know< know you've already defined your loss at know you've already defined your loss at okay< okay so this is how it looks like on the okay so this is how it looks like on the chart< chart now talking about the max profit chart now talking about the max profit and< and Max loss this brings me to my next and Max loss this brings me to my next Point< Point how do you know exactly what is Point how do you know exactly what is the< the max profit and loss of the pring the max profit and loss of the pring butterfly< butterfly so it's actually pretty simple butterfly so it's actually pretty simple so< so let me just walk you through it so so let me just walk you through it so the< the max profit is the width of the put the max profit is the width of the put debit< debit spread plus the credit received debit spread plus the credit received for< for the put brokering butterfly so the for the put brokering butterfly so the put< put debit spread again is the one that put debit spread again is the one that we< we have to pay for so it's on the right we have to pay for so it's on the right hand< hand side so this is the bare put spread hand side so this is the bare put spread all< all right so for this we want to know all right so for this we want to know what< what is the width and then we add on the what is the width and then we add on the credit< credit that we receive for selling this credit that we receive for selling this whole< whole structure okay so let's say for whole structure okay so let's say for example< example if the put debit spread has a example if the put debit spread has a four< four point wide width and the total four point wide width and the total credit< credit receive for the put broking credit receive for the put broking butterfly< butterfly is 30 cents then the max butterfly is 30 cents then the max profit< profit is $400 plus $30 which is profit is $400 plus $30 which is $430< $430 so as you can see down here this is $430 so as you can see down here this is roughly roughly roughly $430< $430 right on the graph over here so as $430. right on the graph over here so as you< you can see it is actually pretty simple you can see it is actually pretty simple to< to calculate all you need to know is to calculate all you need to know is what< what is the max profit that you can gain what is the max profit that you can gain on< on the debit spread that you purchase on the debit spread that you purchase plus< plus the credit that you receive for plus the credit that you receive for selling< selling this whole structure so that's selling this whole structure so that's how< how you calculate the max profit now how you calculate the max profit now what< what about the max loss now the max loss what about the max loss now the max loss is< is also pretty simple right so the max is also pretty simple right so the max loss< loss is simply the width of the put loss is simply the width of the put credit< credit spread so this time it's on the credit spread so this time it's on the left< left hand side right so this is the put left hand side right so this is the put credit< credit spread on the left hand side credit spread on the left hand side minus< minus of the max profit of the put minus of the max profit of the put broken< broken wing butterfly which we have broken wing butterfly which we have already< already constructed at the first part or already constructed at the first part or rather< rather we have already identify down rather we have already identify down here< here so for example if the put credit here so for example if the put credit spread< spread has a 10o wide width and the max spread has a 10o wide width and the max profit< profit is profit is $430< $430 then the max loss is $1,000 minus $430 then the max loss is $1,000 minus $430< $430 which becomes $430 which becomes $570< $570 so as you can see down here at the $570 so as you can see down here at the bottom< bottom down here it's at bottom down here it's at $570< $570 loss and that is exactly how you $570 loss and that is exactly how you calculate< calculate the max profit and the max calculate the max profit and the max loss< loss for the put broken wing butterfly loss for the put broken wing butterfly now< now if you find this a little bit now if you find this a little bit confusing< confusing you can actually just confusing you can actually just construct< construct it on the p&amp;l graph down here construct it on the p&amp;l graph down here and< and it will just tell you up front you and it will just tell you up front you know< know what exactly is the p&amp;l right so if know what exactly is the p&amp;l right so if you< you take a look at the graph down here you take a look at the graph down here they< they will already tell you on the left they will already tell you on the left hand< hand side what is the p&amp;l by the way hand side what is the p&amp;l by the way guys< guys this is using TDM trade I think you guys this is using TDM trade I think you can< can use it on a tasty trade as well you can use it on a tasty trade as well you can< can simulate how the p&amp;l graph looks can simulate how the p&amp;l graph looks like< like or any you know option Builder kind like or any you know option Builder kind of< of uh software you can use to construct of uh software you can use to construct this< this as well now why do I consider the this as well now why do I consider the put< put broken wing butterfly the safest put broken wing butterfly the safest option< option selling strategy by the way if option selling strategy by the way if you< you like this video so far Please you like this

com blueprint< blueprint all right back to the video so blueprint all right back to the video so there< there are a number of reasons why I there are a number of reasons why I think< think this is so so the very first think this is so so the very first reason< reason is that it is a defined risk reason is that it is a defined risk strategy< strategy which means to say that is no strategy which means to say that is no unlimited< unlimited loss for this so you do not unlimited loss for this so you do not have< have to worry that you can lose your have to worry that you can lose your whole< whole account as long as you've already whole account as long as you've already defined< defined your risk at the start you know defined your risk at the start you know what's< what's your max risk then no matter what what's your max risk then no matter what the< the market does right if it crashes and the market does right if it crashes and goes< goes all the way to zero you can't lose goes all the way to zero you can't lose more< more than what you actually you know more than what you actually you know Define< Define the risk at the start now the Define the risk at the start now the next< next reason is that there's only risk to next reason is that there's only risk to one< one side so basically there is no risk one side so basically there is no risk to< to the upside so you don't have to worry to the upside so you don't have to worry about< about you know if the market keeps about you know if the market keeps rallying< rallying all the way to the Moon there's rallying all the way to the Moon there's no< no risk to the top side and you only no risk to the top side and you only just< just have to manage the risk to one side just have to manage the risk to one side so< so this is much easier than you know if so this is much easier than you know if you< you had a iron Condor where there's you had a iron Condor where there's reach< reach to both sides and you have to reach to both sides and you have to manage< manage bit more often so with the broken manage bit more often so with the broken wing< wing butterfly there's actually less wing butterfly there's actually less management< management involved if you even want to management involved if you even want to manage< manage it at all now the next reason is manage it at all now the next reason is that< that it can be constructed to have a that it can be constructed to have a high< high win rate so as you can see down high win rate so as you can see down here< here this has a 87% win rate which is here this has a 87% win rate which is actually< actually considered pretty high right actually considered pretty high right the< the normal neutral ion Condor kind of a the normal neutral ion Condor kind of a structure< structure is roughly around a 65% win structure is roughly around a 65% win rate< rate for this put broken wing butterfly rate for this put broken wing butterfly you< you have a 87% win rate and if you were you have a 87% win rate and if you were to< to push this to the left even more so as to push this to the left even more so as you< you can see this is where the current you can see this is where the current market< market price is so if you push this more market price is so if you push this more to< to the left hand side of where the short to the left hand side of where the short put< put is right now this two short put then put is right now this two short put then you< you could even get a higher win rate so you could even get a higher win rate so again< again it's up to you to construct it how again it's up to you to construct it how you< you want now the next reason is that if you want now the next reason is that if you< you trade it on cash setup index options you trade it on cash setup index options then< then you can potentially realize the max then you can potentially realize the max profit< profit without any early assignment risk profit without any early assignment risk so< so as you can see down here the max so as you can see down here the max profit< profit for the put broker wing butterfly profit for the put broker wing butterfly is< is right at. where the short strikes are is right at where the short strikes are so< so the thing is that if you are trading so the thing is that if you are trading this< this on American style options right for this on American style options right for example< example you trade this on individual example you trade this on individual stocks< stocks or even the index ETFs what stocks or even the index ETFs what happen< happen is that you know let's say for happen is that you know let's say for example< example the market trades down to example the market trades down to somewhere< somewhere down here and there's you know somewhere down here and there's you know 2< 2 days left to expiration now at this 2 days left to expiration now at this point< point in time if you were to leave it point in time if you were to leave it and< and let's say at expiration it actually and let's say at expiration it actually settles< settles down here your profit would be settles down here your profit would be at< at around $300 but the problem with this at around $300 but the problem with this is< is that you will actually be in the is that you will actually be in the money< money right because these are two short money right because these are two short puts< puts down here so anything below the puts down here so anything below the short< short strike of this short put strike short strike of this short put strike you're< you're considered in the money and the you're considered in the money and the buyer< buyer of the put options can actually buyer of the put options can actually choose< choose to exercise the options before choose to exercise the options before expiration< expiration which means to say you know expiration which means to say you know it< it could be that before you actually it could be that before you actually reach< reach insiration all of a sudden you reach insiration all of a sudden you find< find yourself you know with 200 shares find yourself you know with 200 shares and< and if that happens you know this can and if that happens you know this can really< really confuse you because you might really confuse you because you might even< even get into a margin call and it even get into a margin call and it pretty< pretty much destroy you know the way you pretty much destroy you know the way you want< want to trade it right so that is why if want to trade it right so that is why if you< you want to hold this uh to the point you want to hold this uh to the point whereby< whereby you know you want to kind of whereby you know you want to kind of realize< realize you know this point down here or realize you know this point down here or rather< rather you know most of this Max profit rather you know most of this Max profit over< over here then it's better for you to over here then it's better for you to actually< actually trade it on cash shutle index actually trade it on cash shutle index options< options because then there is no early options because then there is no early assignment< assignment risk and since it's cash assignment risk and since it's cash shutle< shutle there'll be no no shares that'll shutle there'll be no no shares that'll be< be assigned to you as well right at be assigned to you as well right at expiration< expiration basically uh the broker will expiration basically uh the broker will just< just tablate whether it's a p&amp;l and then just tablate whether it's a p&amp;l and then they< they will just you know debit or credit they will just you know debit or credit into< into your account now the next reason is into your account now the next reason is for< for premium selling strategies the risk for premium selling strategies the risk reward< reward ratio is actually considered very reward ratio is actually considered very good< good right and of course it depends on good right and of course it depends on how< how you structure it but as you can see how you structure it but as you can see for< for this structure that I've created for this structure that I've created down< down here it's very very close to down here it's very very close to roughly< roughly a one is to one risk reward roughly a one is to one risk reward right< right because your profit Max profit is right because your profit Max profit is $430< $430 your max Ross is about $570 so it's $430 your max Ross is about $570 so it's not< not exactly a one is to one rather 0 not exactly a one is to one rather 0 point< point maybe 0. 8 or 0.

9 but it's pretty point maybe 0. 8 or 0.

9 but it's pretty close< close now if you were to compare this to close now if you were to compare this to other< other strategies like maybe the credit other strategies like maybe the credit spreads< spreads maybe it would be something like spreads maybe it would be something like you're< you're are risking you know $3 just to you're are risking you know $3 just to make< make $1 right and for the iron Condor make $1 right and for the iron Condor it's< it's going to be of a similar structure it's going to be of a similar structure as< as well where you're risking much more as well where you're risking much more than< than you actually going to make so for than you actually going to make so for the< the put broker wing butterfly I would the put broker wing butterfly I would say< say that the risk reward ratio in terms say that the risk reward ratio in terms of< of options selling St strategies is of options selling St strategies is actually< actually considered one of the best so actually considered one of the best so that< that is also why I consider you know that is also why I consider you know this< this is one of the safest option this is one of the safest option strategy< strategy because let's say for example strategy because let's say for example the< the market does trade all the way down the market does trade all the way down and< and you incur your max loss well then it and you incur your max loss well then it takes< takes just only a few more trades that takes just only a few more trades that is< is somewhere within this tense down here is somewhere within this tense down here that< that is able for you to recover you know that is able for you to recover you know the< the max loss but whereas for the iron the max loss but whereas for the iron Condor< Condor or the credit spreads you know it Condor or the credit spreads you know it takes< takes more winners for you to recover takes more winners for you to recover any< any max loss on those trades and finally any max loss on those trades and finally the< the reason why I think that you know the the reason why I think that you know the put< put bring butterfly is the safest option put bring butterfly is the safest option selling< selling strategy is because it aims to selling strategy is because it aims to profit< profit when the market goes down and it profit when the market goes down and it still< still makes money if the market goes up still makes money if the market goes up so< so this is what you call an so this is what you call an omnidirectional< omnidirectional trade whereby you can omnidirectional trade whereby you can make< make money regardless you know where the make money regardless you know where the market< market goes to so as you can see down market goes to so as you can see down here< here the max profit zone is really below here the max profit zone is really below where< where the current market price is so the where the current market price is so the market< market has to actually go down for you market has to actually go down for you to< to have a chance of hitting this Max to have a chance of hitting this Max profit< profit potential of this put brokering profit. potential of this put brokering butterfly< butterfly so most people when they enter butterfly so most people when they enter into< into you know trading they tend to put into you know trading they tend to put you< you know bullish strategies where they you know bullish strategies where they want< want the market to go up but when the want the market to go up but when the market< market goes down that's where they start market goes down that's where they start to< to panic right because a lot of the to panic right because a lot of the positions< positions are going to get hit but with positions are going to get hit but with the< the p broking butterfly you actually do the p broking butterfly you actually do look< look forward for the market to go down look forward for the market to go down right< right because that's how you can right because that's how you can potentially< potentially make the max profit on this potentially make the max profit on this trade< trade now of course we want it to go trade now of course we want it to go down< down but we do not want it to go that down but we do not want it to go that much< much further down because if it goes all much further down because if it goes all the< the way down then you would start to the way down then you would start to lose< lose money over here but then again you lose money over here but then again you know< know it has has to go past this Zone know it has has to go past this Zone first< first it has to go past your max profit first it has to go past your max profit Zone< Zone in order for you to go past to the Zone in order for you to go past to the point< point you know where you know you start point you know where you know you start to< to lose money so in a sense you know to lose money so in a sense you know psychology< psychology wise you you feel a little psychology wise you you feel a little bit< bit better if the market starts to trade bit better if the market starts to trade down< down because then you have an down because then you have an opportunity< opportunity to hit this Max profit tent opportunity to hit this Max profit tent over< over here all right guys so this is the over here all right guys so this is the put< put broken wing butterfly by the way if put broken wing butterfly by the way if you< you like this video then you're you like this video then

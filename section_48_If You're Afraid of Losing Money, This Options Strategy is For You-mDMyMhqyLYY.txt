Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video I'm< I'm going to be sharing with you a I'm going to be sharing with you a strategy< strategy that you can use to generate strategy that you can use to generate you< you know pretty safe monthly income you know pretty safe monthly income right< right so what is this strategy so this right so what is this strategy so this strategy< strategy basically is a way for you to strategy basically is a way for you to accumulate< accumulate any underlying that you want accumulate any underlying that you want so< so any stock that you want to own and so any stock that you want to own and also< also generate you know some premium also generate you know some premium along< along the way right some monthly income along the way right some monthly income so< so as you can see down here uh this is so as you can see down here uh this is Google< Google so I've already accumulated you Google so I've already accumulated you know< know quite a number of shares of Google know quite a number of shares of Google and< and and you know I do use this strategy and and you know I do use this strategy as< as well as a few other strategies to as well as a few other strategies to generally< generally accumulate some of the shares generally accumulate some of the shares so< so I want to share with you you know so I want to share with you you know what< what is this strategy so for you to what is this strategy so for you to accumulate< accumulate any shares one of the main accumulate any shares one of the main component< component of this strategy is to use component of this strategy is to use what< what is called the cash secure put right what is called the cash secure put right basically< basically is to sell puts on the underly basically is to sell puts on the underly so< so if you want to generate you know so if you want to generate you know pretty< pretty you know consistent monthly pretty you know consistent monthly income< income all you got to do is to sell you income all you got to do is to sell you know< know the put and then receive the know the put and then receive the premium< premium and then just wait and see you premium and then just wait and see you know< know if the put options actually get know if the put options actually get assigned< assigned or now if it doesn't get assigned or now if it doesn't get assigned< assigned all you got to do is just put assigned all you got to do is just put it< it on again now for this strategy we it on again now for this strategy we aren't< aren't just going to only sell the put aren't just going to only sell the put right< right so we're going to add another right so we're going to add another strategy< strategy together right to combine this strategy together right to combine this together< together so it makes it a little bit together so it makes it a little bit much< much safer just in case you know if the much safer just in case you know if the market< market does come down we're going to get market does come down we're going to get you< you know a little bit of a compensation you know a little bit of a compensation if< if the market comes down in a sense of a if the market comes down in a sense of a second< second form of strategy so I'm just second form of strategy so I'm just going< going to share with you what this going to share with you what this strategy< strategy is so first of all let's take a strategy is so first of all let's take a look< look at the DT de selection right so look at the DT de selection right so before< before we enter into any option trade we before we enter into any option trade we need< need to face the decision of you know need to face the decision of you know which< which DTE to actually choose so because which DTE to actually choose so because this< this strategy is to actually own the this strategy is to actually own the underline< underline I'm not too particular in the underline I'm not too particular in the sense< sense you know which DTE you want to sense you know which DTE you want to choose< choose so again I mentioned this in a choose so again I mentioned this in a few< few of my videos if you have been a few of my videos if you have been a follower< follower on my you know channel for follower on my you know channel for quite< quite some time now then you know that I quite some time now then you know that I generally< generally like to go for the 45 days and generally like to go for the 45 days and above< above right the 45 DTE and above mainly above right the 45 DTE and above mainly because< because the has an edge and the main because the has an edge and the main reason< reason we want to do that is to avoid reason we want to do that is to avoid assignment< assignment right but for this strategy assignment right but for this strategy we< we actually want to get assigned so if we actually want to get assigned so if you< you want to get uh consistent monthly you want to get uh consistent monthly income< income right to get some premium every income right to get some premium every single< single month then what you want to go single month then what you want to go for< for is somewhere around this 30 days for is somewhere around this 30 days Mark< Mark right so you can go anything lesser Mark right so you can go anything lesser than< than that definitely for sure let's say than that definitely for sure let's say for< for example if you want something that for example if you want something that is< is weekly all you got to do is just is weekly all you got to do is just click< click the weekly option and just put on click the weekly option and just put on this< this strategy right but for this video this strategy right but for this video let's< let's focus on the monthly one right let's focus on the monthly one right because< because again there's always some because again there's always some trade-off< trade-off right some people ask is trade-off right some people ask is weekly< weekly better is monthly better the weekly better is monthly better the trade-off< trade-off just comes down you know in trade-off just comes down you know in the< the return and the overall premium if the return and the overall premium if you< you go for a longer DTE so let me just you go for a longer DTE so let me just give< give you a very quick comparison if you give you a very quick comparison if you go< go for the longer DTE one you notice go for the longer DTE one you notice that< that the absolute premium that means the that the absolute premium that means the actual< actual dollar amount that you receive is actual dollar amount that you receive is going< going to be higher than if you go for going to be higher than if you go for the< the weekly ones right this is just the weekly ones right this is just common< common sense right common sense right $155< $155 whereas this one is $155 whereas this one is $315< $315 but the difference right now is $315 but the difference right now is that< that for the weekly you actually get you that for the weekly you actually get you know< know a higher return right because you know a higher return right because you get< get this much premium let's say for get this much premium let's say for example< example it's example it's $155< $155 only in 7 Days right but then for $155 only in 7 Days right but then for the< the 27 days DTE right you can see that the 27 days DTE right you can see that you< you get $35 but you need to wait 27 days you get $35 but you need to wait 27 days for< for you to you know really have this for you to you know really have this full< full premium realized to you so if you full premium realized to you so if you were< were to just sell this two times right were to just sell this two times right for< for example you put this on this week for example you put this on this week next< next week once let's say for example it next week once let's say for example it get< get uh assigned or it expires you sell get uh assigned or it expires you sell another< another one again you're going to get another one again you're going to get roughly< roughly $310 already so in Just 2 weeks roughly $310 already so in Just 2 weeks right< right 14 days you're going to get right 14 days you're going to get roughly< roughly about the same premium as you roughly about the same premium as you have< have here right this is for 27 days have here right this is for 27 days right< right so this really comes down to you right so this really comes down to you you< you know which one you prefer so it's you know which one you prefer so it's always< always just a trade-off because let's always just a trade-off because let's say< say for example you only have enough to say for example you only have enough to just< just buy 100 shares then if you were to just buy 100 shares then if you were to sell< sell this option down here and you would sell this option down here and you would get< get a sign all you're going to get is get a sign all you're going to get is only< only $155 but if you had this one only $155 but if you had this one instead< instead you sold this one you would get instead you sold this one you would get $35< $35 before you get assigned so you will $35 before you get assigned so you will get< get generally more all right so now get generally more all right so now let's< let's get into the actual strategy so let's get into the actual strategy so let< let me just close up this uh DTE down let me just close up this uh DTE down here< here so for this DTE first of all we are here so for this DTE first of all we are going< going to go to the put s right this put going to go to the put s right this put section< section and then we're going to choose section and then we're going to choose our< our put option right we're going to sell our put option right we're going to sell our< our put so what is this put that we our put so what is this put that we generally< generally want to do now there are two generally want to do now there are two ways< ways to go about this the first way is ways to go about this the first way is there< there is already a price that you have there is already a price that you have in< in mind so let's say for example you in mind so let's say for example you have< have already decided that hey at 133 have already decided that hey at 133 this< this is where you would like to go long this is where you would like to. go long on< on the under line right so all you got on the under line right so all you got to< to do is you just select this 133 strike to do is you just select this 133 strike price< price so if the market goes below this price so if the market goes below this 133< 133 right at expiration you're going to 133 right at expiration you're going to get< get assigns so this is the first way now get assigns so this is the first way now the< the second way is to go by Delta right the second way is to go by Delta right so< so you can go from anywhere from around so you can go from anywhere from around say< say 16 Delta which is where the expected say 16 Delta which is where the expected move< move is all the way up right so it move is all the way up right so it really< really depends on what you want so the really depends on what you want so the higher< higher chance of you getting a sign of higher chance of you getting a sign of course< course will be closer to where the course will be closer to where the current< current market price is this is what we current market price is this is what we call< call at the money right at the money call at the money right at the money strike< strike price so at the money is 137 so strike price so at the money is 137 so you< you definitely get more premium but the you definitely get more premium but the chances< chances of the market going below this chances of the market going below this price< price is going to be higher so when we price is going to be higher so when we are< are selecting this stri price we also are selecting this stri price we also want< want to be a little bit strategic right want to be a little bit strategic right because< because at the same time we want to get because at the same time we want to get the< the premium as much as possible we want the premium as much as possible we want to< to keep selling this option that means to keep selling this option that means ideally< ideally we want it to expire so we can ideally we want it to expire so we can sell< sell it again but on the other hand we sell it again but on the other hand we also< also do want to get long the underlying also do want to get long the underlying right< right we want to get the shares because right we want to get the shares because there's< there's an opportunity whereby once we there's an opportunity whereby once we along< along the shares the market can go up along the shares the market can go up and< and then we can participate in the and then we can participate in the capital< capital gains so one of the things that capital gains so one of the things that I< I had experienced before would be to I had experienced before would be to sell< sell a strike price so let's say for sell a strike price so let's say for example< example I sold the 130 only to find out example I sold the 130 only to find out that< that the market actually did not you that the market actually did not you know< know go below this Price Right it went know go below this Price Right it went somewhere< somewhere around there and then it go somewhere around there and then it go all< all the way up right and then yes I all the way up right and then yes I received< received the premium but then if I had received the premium but then if I had been< been assigned I would have actually been assigned I would have actually gotten< gotten much more because the capital gotten much more because the capital gains< gains from the stock itself will be much gains from the stock itself will be much higher< higher so you need to have a fine higher so you need to have a fine balance< balance between these two so how do you balance between these two so how do you have< have this fine balance so generally I have this fine balance so generally I would< would say somewhere around 30 Deltas or would say somewhere around 30 Deltas or maybe< maybe 20 Deltas would be you know a nice maybe 20 Deltas would be you know a nice place< place right that means to say it's going place right that means to say it's going to< to have either a 20 to 30% chance you're to have either a 20 to 30% chance you're going< going to be assigned at expiration so in going to be assigned at expiration so in this< this case let us just use the example of this case let us just use the example of somewhere< somewhere around 131 or maybe 132 so 132 somewhere around 131 or maybe 132 so 132 is< is around 26 Deltas so this is where we is around 26 Deltas so this is where we have< have now identified our cash secure P have now identified our cash secure P our< our shotput option now the next one is our shotput option now the next one is where< where we're going to use part of this where we're going to use part of this premium< premium to buy a little bit of insurance premium to buy a little bit of insurance right< right let's say for example the market right let's say for example the market comes< comes down now we already know that we comes down now we already know that we do< do not mind actually getting long the do not mind actually getting long the underlying< underlying shares but it doesn't hurt to underlying shares but it doesn't hurt to get< get a little bit more out of it when we get a little bit more out of it when we do< do get assigned right so how do we do do get assigned right so how do we do that< that so the way to do this is to that so the way to do this is to actually< actually also put on another strategy actually also put on another strategy that< that is called the BEP put strategy that is called the BEP put strategy right< right the barep put spread which is a right the barep put spread which is a bearish< bearish strategy so how we are going to bearish strategy so how we are going to do< do this is by using part of this premium do this is by using part of this premium to< to purchase this debit spread right so to purchase this debit spread right so the< the bare put spread is a debit spread so the bare put spread is a debit spread so as< as you can see down here our premium as you can see down here our premium that< that we're going to receive is that we're going to receive is $144< $144 so from here we want to use part of $144 so from here we want to use part of it< it so let's say we use at most we want it so let's say we use at most we want to< to use somewhere around half right we to use somewhere around half right we try< try to gaug around half so what we can try to gaug around half so what we can do< do is we can purchase this put debit do is we can purchase this put debit spread< spread down here and see how much credit spread down here and see how much credit we< we left with so as you can see we left we left with so as you can see we left with< with a dollar credit which means to say with a dollar credit which means to say that< that this whole purchase down here is that this whole purchase down here is about< about $44 thereabouts right so how do we about $44 thereabouts right so how do we know< know exactly you know what's the kind of know exactly you know what's the kind of profit< profit that we can get now if you were profit that we can get now if you were to< to take a look at the p&amp;l graph down to take a look at the p&amp;l graph down here< here so let me just go all the way to here so let me just go all the way to the< the bottom so you can see down here this the bottom so you can see down here this is< is the p&amp;l graph so what it means is is the p&amp;l graph so what it means is that< that if the market actually goes down that if the market actually goes down below< below your put debit spread you have an below your put debit spread you have an opportunity< opportunity to actually take profits on opportunity to actually take profits on that< that debit spread right so if the market that debit spread right so if the market goes< goes down you're going to take a profit goes down you're going to take a profit on< on that so with this strategy because on that so with this strategy because first< first of all this is not a cash settle first of all this is not a cash settle index< index options that means to say you can index options that means to say you can get< get assigned right so any short options get assigned right so any short options that< that is in the money before expiration that is in the money before expiration the< the buyer of the put option always have the buyer of the put option always have the< the you know chance to just exercise it the you know chance to just exercise it before< before EXP ation so if they're going to before EXP ation so if they're going to exercise< exercise it you're going to beong a 100 exercise it you're going to beong a 100 shares< shares now the thing is that when you shares now the thing is that when you put< put on this put debit spread now you're put on this put debit spread now you're going< going to have two short puts right we going to have two short puts right we know< know the short putut down here we want know the short putut down here we want to< to get assigned but we do not want to to get assigned but we do not want to get< get assigned on the second short putut get assigned on the second short putut which< which is part of this put debit spread which is part of this put debit spread so< so how do we reduce the chances of so how do we reduce the chances of getting< getting assigned there so basically this getting assigned there so basically this is< is what we got to do by the way if you is what we got to do by the way if you like< like this video so

com blueprint all right< right back to the video all right so right back to the video all right so we've< we've already got the put debit spread we've already got the put debit spread in< in place we have the shop in place so in place we have the shop in place so what< what we're waiting for is for the market what we're waiting for is for the market to< to actually trade down so once the to actually trade down so once the market< market actually trades down it's good market actually trades down it's good for< for put debit spread at the same time we for put debit spread at the same time we also< also do want to get long the underlying also do want to get long the underlying shares< shares to get assign but first we want shares to get assign but first we want to< to manage our put debit spread so the to manage our put debit spread so the way< way we want to do that is that once the way we want to do that is that once the market< market actually goes below your put market actually goes below your put debit< debit spread you can choose to take debit spread you can choose to take profit< profit on the debit spread that means to profit on the debit spread that means to say< say you will close out the put debit say you will close out the put debit spread< spread first now how much profit before spread first now how much profit before you< you actually close out this put debit you actually close out this put debit spread< spread now you can take it off at any spread now you can take it off at any amount< amount that you want but generally I amount that you want but generally I would< would say somewhere around 80 to 90% would say somewhere around 80 to 90% would< would be pretty good so if you see that would be pretty good so if you see that you< you have gain you know close to that Max you have gain you know close to that Max profit< profit of this put debit spread you can profit of this put debit spread you can close< close out the trade now once you close close out the trade now once you close out< out the trade what you're going to be out the trade what you're going to be left< left with is your short putut right so left with is your short putut right so let< let me just remove this uh put deit let me just remove this uh put deit spread< spread first so now you're going to be spread first so now you're going to be left< left with this short putut now at this left with this short putut now at this point< point in time two things can happen point in time two things can happen right< right the market can continue to go right the market can continue to go lower< lower and then it expires that lower and then it expires that expiration< expiration which is what you want right expiration which is what you want right because< because you want to get assigned on the because you want to get assigned on the shares< shares you want to accumulate your shares you want to accumulate your shares< shares right as you can see this is how shares right as you can see this is how I< I accumulated my shares for this stock I accumulated my shares for this stock so< so once it goes down below that that's so once it goes down below that that's good< good right we accumulated now the other good right we accumulated now the other thing< thing that can actually happen is that thing that can actually happen is that the< the market once it goes down you've the market once it goes down you've already< already taken profit on your put debit already taken profit on your put debit spread< spread the market actually bounce back spread the market actually bounce back up< up so what happens then so remember up so what happens then so remember you've< you've already taken profit on your put you've already taken profit on your put debit< debit spread so now you're left with the debit spread so now you're left with the short< short put so what happens to the short short put so what happens to the short put< put as the market goes up well your put as the market goes up well your short< short. putut will make on it as well so short putut will make on it as well so that< that means to say let's say if the that means to say let's say if the market< market goes up and expires above your sh market goes up and expires above your sh put< put strike and expiration then you're put strike and expiration then you're going< going to make profits on both the going to make profits on both the strategies< strategies right the put debit spread strategies right the put debit spread remember< remember as it goes down somewhere remember as it goes down somewhere around< around Max profit you close it out and around Max profit you close it out and then< then now you're left with the short put then now you're left with the short put and< and then once uh it's closed to and then once uh it's closed to expiration< expiration let's say the market goes up expiration let's say the market goes up and< and it expires out of the money you get and it expires out of the money you get the< the full premium on the Shar food as the full premium on the Shar food as well< well so this way you get some kind of a well so this way you get some kind of a double< double income double the profits that double income double the profits that you< you can receive compared to just having you can receive compared to just having the< the short putut now what if the market the short putut now what if the market actually< actually goes up above your put debit actually goes up above your put debit spread< spread after you put on you know this spread after you put on you know this strategy< strategy so let me just simulate this strategy so let me just simulate this whole< whole strategy again so let me just go whole strategy again so let me just go up< up and put on this uh put debit spread up and put on this uh put debit spread which< which we have so this is the put debit which we have so this is the put debit spread< spread which we chosen earlier on so let spread which we chosen earlier on so let me< me just remove this drawing so what if me just remove this drawing so what if the< the market just trades up from this the market just trades up from this point< point on well in this case your put point on well in this case your put debit< debit spread will expire worthless along debit spread will expire worthless along with< with your short putut so that means to with your short putut so that means to say< say you're going to receive the premium say you're going to receive the premium right< right of this amount which is roughly right of this amount which is roughly around< around $100 so as you can see down here around $100 so as you can see down here we< we have used part of it to actually we have used part of it to actually purchase< purchase this put debit spread as a hch purchase this put debit spread as a hch but< but if it doesn't go down it goes up but if it doesn't go down it goes up then< then hey at least we still realize some then hey at least we still realize some of< of the premium which we sold using the of the premium which we sold using the short< short putut right now this strategy is short putut right now this strategy is actually< actually pretty flexible because we can actually pretty flexible because we can manipulate< manipulate the strikes down here to get manipulate the strikes down here to get the< the desired kind of structure we want so the desired kind of structure we want so let's< let's say for example you want to be let's say for example you want to be little< little bit more defensive right you want little bit more defensive right you want to< to try and collect a little more if the to try and collect a little more if the market< market comes down right so in this case market comes down right so in this case you< you will want to use slightly more of you will want to use slightly more of this< this premium to purchase a bigger width this premium to purchase a bigger width debit< debit spread down here so maybe instead debit spread down here so maybe instead of< of 1. Y you could go for two points yde of 1.

Y you could go for two points yde now< now you notice if you go for two points now you notice if you go for two points wide< wide what you'll be left with is 61 wide what you'll be left with is 61 cents< cents in terms of credit so overall cents in terms of credit so overall you're< you're still going to get a credit so you're still going to get a credit so now< now let us take a look at the p&amp;l graph now let us take a look at the p&amp;l graph so< so if you take a look at the our graph so if you take a look at the our graph so< so same thing if the market goes above so same thing if the market goes above this< this whole structure once you put it on this whole structure once you put it on expires< expires out of the money then you're expires out of the money then you're just< just going to get the minimum which is just going to get the minimum which is the< the credit which you receive now if the the credit which you receive now if the market< market comes down as you can see the max market comes down as you can see the max you< you can get is about you can get is about $261< $261 that means you get the max profit $261 that means you get the max profit from< from the put debit spread also the max from the put debit spread also the max profit< profit from the shop put right uh in the profit from the shop put right uh in the event< event whereby the shop putut also event whereby the shop putut also expires< expires worthless so this way again two expires worthless so this way again two different< different uh strategies you have going different uh strategies you have going on< on so same thing if the market goes down on so same thing if the market goes down below< below your put debit spread and let's below your put debit spread and let's say< say you see that the p&amp;l is something say you see that the p&amp;l is something that< that you like right maybe it's 50% maybe that you like right maybe it's 50% maybe it's< it's 70% maybe it's 90% right at this it's 70% maybe it's 90% right at this point< point this is where you want to close point this is where you want to close out< out that put debit spread take the out that put debit spread take the profit< profit right secure that profit first profit right secure that profit first now< now we are left with the short put again now we are left with the short put again right< right so let me just remove this put right so let me just remove this put debit< debit spread again so now with this debit spread again so now with this short< short putut all you got to do right now short putut all you got to do right now you< you can just leave it and see where it you can just leave it and see where it actually< actually lands at expiration actually lands at expiration now< now if you're a little bit more advanced now if you're a little bit more advanced here's< here's what you can additionally do so here's what you can additionally do so let's< let's say for example the market goes let's say for example the market goes further< further down so let me just remove this further down so let me just remove this drawing< drawing so let's say the market goes drawing so let's say the market goes further< further down and it's close to further down and it's close to expiration< expiration and if it's close to expiration and if it's close to expiration< expiration and you're not assigned yet expiration and you're not assigned yet one< one thing you could do is to actually one thing you could do is to actually roll< roll this put out right you already have roll this put out right you already have this< this put option down here what you can this put option down here what you can do< do is to roll out to the next expiration do is to roll out to the next expiration date< date or a first further expiration date date or a first further expiration date and< and then roll the strike down as well so and then roll the strike down as. well so what< what happens right now is that this what happens right now is that this strike< strike price instead of 132 you can roll strike price instead of 132 you can roll it< it down maybe you can roll it to it down maybe you can roll it to 130< 130 and then with this not only do you 130 and then with this not only do you get< get you know some premium right get you know some premium right depending< depending on how far out you roll also

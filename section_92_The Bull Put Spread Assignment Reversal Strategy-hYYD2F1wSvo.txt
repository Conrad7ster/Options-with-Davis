================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so question for you all right alrighty so question for you what< what do you do when your credit spreads what do you do when your credit spreads get< get assigned right more specifically get assigned right more specifically what< what you do when your boo put spread what you do when your boo put spread gets< gets assigned right so your boo put gets assigned right so your boo put spread< spread is the put credit spread so what spread is the put credit spread so what do< do you do when you're assigned right so do you do when you're assigned right so this< this is where a lot of people get this is where a lot of people get confused< confused and I've got a few people that confused and I've got a few people that have< have reached out to me asking me you have reached out to me asking me you know< know what they should be doing and know what they should be doing and they're< they're afraid that you know they get a they're afraid that you know they get a margin< margin call and so on and so forth so margin call and so on and so forth so for< for this video I'm going to be diving for this video I'm going to be diving into< into this uh blue put spread assignment into this uh blue put spread assignment reversal< reversal strategy and what it simply is reversal strategy and what it simply is is< is just three simple steps to help you is just three simple steps to help you unwind< unwind this uh put credit spread unwind this uh put credit spread assignment< assignment and I also share with you assignment and I also share with you what< what to do once you have unwinded it all what to do once you have unwinded it all right< right let's Dive Right into this okay so right let's Dive Right into this okay so on< on the left hand side you can see that on the left hand side you can see that this< this is the chart down here and I've put this is the chart down here and I've put on< on a bull put spread down here so the on a bull put spread down here so the question< question is when are you most likely to question is when are you most likely to get< get assigned on your bull put spread get assigned on your bull put spread right< right you will most likely get a sign on right you will most likely get a sign on your< your put spread only if your shop would your put spread only if your shop would leg< leg goes in the money and shot put Lake leg goes in the money and shot put Lake I< I mean this so basically for a boot put I mean this so basically for a boot put spread< spread there are two Lakes we call this spread there are two Lakes we call this the< the shot put Lake and for the long put the shot put Lake and for the long put we< we call this the long put leg so you can we call this the long put leg so you can only< only get assigned or rather you only only get assigned or rather you only have< have a chance of getting a sign when have a chance of getting a sign when your< your shot put lake is in the money that your shot put lake is in the money that means< means the price has gone below your means the price has gone below your short< short strike of the put option but if short strike of the put option but if the< the price is above your shot put strike the price is above your shot put strike then< then there's no risk of early assignment then there's no risk of early assignment at< at all right and also when the extrinsic at all right and also when the extrinsic value< value of the shot put lake is very value of the shot put lake is very little< little and usually it's very little little and usually it's very little right< right when there's not many days to right when there's not many days to expiration< expiration left you will notice that a expiration left you will notice that a lot< lot of times you get assigned very close lot of times you get assigned very close to< to expiration if it's in the money maybe to expiration if it's in the money maybe like< like three four seven days right and like three four seven days right and also< also depending on how deep in money your also depending on how deep in money your shot< shot put lake is right so if the market shot put lake is right so if the market really< really goes all the way down way past really goes all the way down way past your< your long put strike then this is what your long put strike then this is what you< you call deep in the money then there is you call deep in the money then there is a< a likelihood that you could get early a likelihood that you could get early assigned< assigned right even though there is like assigned right even though there is like 30< 30 days or 20 odd days left in your 30 days or 20 odd days left in your option< option right so it very is very option right so it very is very dependent< dependent on how much extrinsic value. dependent on how much extrinsic value left< left so this is the number that you left so this is the number that you really< really want to take note off when you really want to take note off when you have< have any in the money shot put options have any in the money shot put options as< as part of your bull put spread so what as part of your bull put spread so what happens< happens when you're assigned on your happens when you're assigned on your shot< shot put link well basically you'll be shot put link well basically you'll be long< long 100 shares at the shop puts Lake long 100 shares at the shop puts Lake strike< strike price so you'll be 100 shares at strike price so you'll be 100 shares at this< this price down here and then you will this price down here and then you will also< also still keep your long put option also still keep your long put option right< right this doesn't matter whether you right this doesn't matter whether you know< know the price is in between these two know the price is in between these two strikes< strikes or maybe the price has gone way strikes or maybe the price has gone way past< past right because you are long the put past right because you are long the put down< down here you do not get early down here you do not get early assignment< assignment because you are the person assignment because you are the person who< who decide whether you want to exercise who decide whether you want to exercise the< the option or not right so if you decide the option or not right so if you decide not< not to exercise your long put option not to exercise your long put option then< then there's no such thing as assignment then there's no such thing as assignment assignment< assignment only belongs to short options assignment only belongs to short options if< if you're short any option then there if you're short any option then there will< will be you know chance of early will be you know chance of early assignment< assignment so when you are assigned on assignment so when you are assigned on your< your shot put leg firstly you'll be long your shot put leg firstly you'll be long 100< 100 shares at the shot put leg strike 100 shares at the shot put leg strike and< and you may get a margin call if you and you may get a margin call if you don't< don't have sufficient funds to buy the don't have sufficient funds to buy the 100< 100 shares which is most likely the case 100 shares which is most likely the case for< for many people right because most for many people right because most people< people open up their account just to people open up their account just to trade< trade options they have no intention of trade options they have no intention of getting< getting long 100 shares so when they get getting long 100 shares so when they get assigned< assigned right and then get long 100 assigned right and then get long 100 shares< shares this is where it kind of messes shares this is where it kind of messes up< up their account because now the broker up their account because now the broker will< will reach out to them and tell them to will reach out to them and tell them to top< top up their account because they don't top up their account because they don't have< have enough cash to Long the 100 shares have enough cash to Long the 100 shares so< so at this point what do you do so there so at this point what do you do so there are< are a few people who have mentioned that are a few people who have mentioned that what< what they would do is that they will what they would do is that they will just< just exercise their long put option now just exercise their long put option now two< two things to this number one you can two things to this number one you can exercise< exercise your long food option only if exercise your long food option only if the< the market has gone way below your this the market has gone way below your this long< long put option right otherwise it long put option right otherwise it doesn't< doesn't make sense because when you are doesn't make sense because when you are exercising< exercising your long foot option what exercising your long foot option what you're< you're basically doing is that you're you're basically doing is that you're telling< telling the broker that you want to sell telling the broker that you want to sell 100< 100 shares at this strike price so if 100 shares at this strike price so if the< the current market is let's say the current market is let's say somewhere< somewhere here which is above your long somewhere here which is above your long put< put strike what you're essentially doing put strike what you're essentially doing is< is that you have bought a hundred shares is that you have bought a hundred shares roughly< roughly at this price let's say It's 190 roughly at this price let's say It's 190 and< and then you want to sell it somewhere and then you want to sell it somewhere around< around here let's say for example this around here let's say for example this is< is 182 right when the current market is is 182 right when the current market is somewhere< somewhere maybe around 184. if the somewhere maybe around 184.

if the market< market is 184 you're telling the broker market is 184 you're telling the broker you< you want to sell off at 182 you're you want to sell off at 182 you're taking< taking an additional two dollar loss for taking an additional two dollar loss for every< every share for no reason right so every share for no reason right so there's< there's no point for you to exercise there's no point for you to exercise your< your long put option now number two some your long put option now number two some people< people decide to actually exercise their people decide to actually exercise their long< long put option if the market has gone long put option if the market has gone way< way past down their long put strike down way past down their long put strike down here< here right so what happens is that when here right so what happens is that when you< you do this yes you'll be clearing away you do this yes you'll be clearing away your< your 100 shares right so your 100 shares your 100 shares right so your 100 shares will< will be gone because your long put will be gone because your long put strike< strike essentially just sells away this strike essentially just sells away this 100< 100 shares at whatever the strike price 100 shares at whatever the strike price is< is so in this case let's say it's 182 is so in this case let's say it's 182 but< but you'll be taking the max loss right but you'll be taking the max loss right because< because you are taking the full loss because you are taking the full loss from< from this strike to down here so you're from this strike to down here so you're taking< taking the max loss of your credit taking the max loss of your credit spread< spread but there's no reason for you to spread but there's no reason for you to actually< actually take Max loss on this spread actually take Max loss on this spread because< because your put option down here because your put option down here actually< actually still have some extrinsic value actually still have some extrinsic value right< right when there's still some extrinsic right when there's still some extrinsic value< value what it actually is is some value what it actually is is some cushion< cushion for your loss on this spread so cushion for your loss on this spread so by< by exercising your put option what by exercising your put option what you're< you're doing is that you're giving up you're doing is that you're giving up all< all the extrinsic value of this put all the extrinsic value of this put option< option which is not the wisest choice option which is not the wisest choice right< right instead you want to unwind this right instead you want to unwind this rather< rather than exercise your long put rather than exercise your long put option< option so what do you do so I'm going to option so what do you do so I'm going to share< share with you three very simple steps share with you three very simple steps to< to unwind your assignment to unwind your assignment so< so the very first step is to sell off so the very first step is to sell off your< your 100 shares so this way you no your 100 shares so this way you no longer< longer get the margin call because when longer get the margin call because when you< you sell off the shares you get back you sell off the shares you get back your< your capital for putting up onto the for your capital for putting up onto the for the< the shares so your broker will no longer the shares so your broker will no longer pester< pester you anymore to keep asking you pester you anymore to keep asking you for< for a margin call so now you have no for a margin call so now you have no position< position now the next step is to sell position now the next step is to sell the< the original shot put strike price which the original shot put strike price which you< you put on right so if your strike price you put on right so if your strike price down< down here is 190 and let's say it was down here is 190 and let's say it was like< like I don't know eight days. left to like I don't know eight days left to expiration< expiration so what you want to do is you expiration so what you want to do is you go< go back and sell the very same strike to go back and sell the very same strike to re-establish< re-establish this put spread again re-establish this put spread again all< all right and then step number three all right and then step number three basically< basically what you want to do is to do basically what you want to do is to do this< this two steps down here simultaneously this two steps down here simultaneously so< so if you really think about it it's so if you really think about it it's just< just one step right you just do the just one step right you just do the selling< selling off of the hundred shares and selling off of the hundred shares and then< then you sell the original strike of the then you sell the original strike of the shot< shot put in one order ticket right so shot put in one order ticket right so this< this is for think or stream you can see this is for think or stream you can see that< that they do this in one order ticket that they do this in one order ticket whatever< whatever platform you're using you want whatever platform you're using you want to< to find a way to do that as well because to find a way to do that as well because while< while you can actually do this while you can actually do this separately< separately that means you can sell out separately that means you can sell out 100< 100 shares first then you sell the 100 shares first then you sell the original< original shot put strike price what original shot put strike price what happens< happens is that there could be legging happens is that there could be legging risk< risk that means the moment you sell off risk that means the moment you sell off the< the 100 shares the market could have the 100 shares the market could have just< just gone down or gone up right so it just gone down or gone up right so it will< will no longer be sort of like will no longer be sort of like equilibrium< equilibrium to where you're selling your equilibrium to where you're selling your shot< shot put stripe because now your shot shot put stripe because now your shot put< put strike remember there's intrinsic put strike remember there's intrinsic value< value so the intrinsic value moves value so the intrinsic value moves together< together with where the current market together with where the current market price< price is so if you do not want any price is so if you do not want any lagging< lagging risk then the best is to do this lagging risk then the best is to do this in< in just one order ticket like this one in just one order ticket like this one down< down here which I'm showing you right down here which I'm showing you right now< now all right so basically it's just one now all right so basically it's just one simple< simple step to unwind your assignment on simple step to unwind your assignment on your< your bull put spread right so it's your bull put spread right so it's pretty< pretty simple so the question now pretty simple so the question now becomes< becomes what do you do after unwinding becomes what do you do after unwinding your< your assignment by the way if you like your assignment by the way if you like this< this video

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video because now remember back to the video because now remember although< although you have unwinded your 100 although you have unwinded your 100 shares< shares you have now put back on the shares you have now put back on the short< short put strike which had already been short put strike which had already been assigned< assigned before so if it had already assigned before so if it had already been< been assigned before there's still going been assigned before there's still going to< to be the same risk that you're gonna to be the same risk that you're gonna get< get assigned again right and especially get assigned again right and especially if< if your broker somehow charges you an if your broker somehow charges you an assignment< assignment fee then you're gonna keep assignment fee then you're gonna keep getting< getting a sign for no reason and then getting a sign for no reason and then you're< you're gonna keep paying the broker in you're gonna keep paying the broker in this< this assignment fee right so it's best this assignment fee right so it's best also< also to find Brokers that do not charge also to find Brokers that do not charge you< you assignment fee by the way so what do you assignment fee by the way so what do you do< you do at this point of time after you you do at this point of time after you have< have you know unwinded your assignment have you know unwinded your assignment you're< you're still not out of the woods all you're still not out of the woods all right< right because there is still always a right because there is still always a chance< chance that your shop will strike going chance that your shop will strike going to< to get assigned again and it can happen to get assigned again and it can happen as< as early as the same day you put on this as early as the same day you put on this shot< shot put strike so there are two options shot put strike so there are two options the< the first option is to roll to a further the first option is to roll to a further DTE< DTE right let's say for example this is DTE right let's say for example this is uh< uh roughly around eight days eight DTE uh roughly around eight days eight DTE both< both are eight DTE by the way because both are eight DTE by the way because you< you put on uh as a credit spread as a you put on uh as a credit spread as a blue< blue put spread so what you can do is blue put spread so what you can do is take< take this whole thing and then you roll take this whole thing and then you roll it< it to a further data DTE right so maybe it to a further data DTE right so maybe you< you roll it to the next 45 DTE now one you roll it to the next 45 DTE now one thing< thing about this is that if you were to thing about this is that if you were to roll< roll an in the money boo put spread roll an in the money boo put spread chances< chances are that it will be for a debit chances are that it will be for a debit right< right because you can only usually get a right because you can only usually get a credit< credit if this put spread is out of the credit if this put spread is out of the money< money or slightly in the money but most money or slightly in the money but most of< of the time if it's already deep in the of the time if it's already deep in the money< money it's going to be hard to get any money it's going to be hard to get any credit< credit so it'd be for a debit so if it's credit so it'd be for a debit so if it's for< for a debit basically you'll be for a debit basically you'll be increasing< increasing risk on the original trade increasing risk on the original trade but< but you get to extend the life of the but you get to extend the life of the bull< bull put spread so to speak because you bull put spread so to speak because you know< know if you still have a very bullish know if you still have a very bullish view< view maybe the market can come back up view maybe the market can come back up right< right in the next what 45 days right in the next what 45 days based< based on the new DTE so if it does come based on the new DTE so if it does come back< back up then you can sort of like back up then you can sort of like Salvage< Salvage the trade but then again it is Salvage the trade but then again it is actually< actually just a new trade that you put actually just a new trade that you put on< on right so the new trade you put on is on right so the new trade you put on is actually< actually just an in the money put spread actually just an in the money put spread which< which actually have a lower probability which actually have a lower probability than< than when you first put on the bubu than when you first put on the bubu spread< spread which was out of the money so spread which was out of the money so this< this option I don't really like it this option I don't really like it although< although some people do want to do that although some people do want to do that I< I would prefer option two and that is to I would prefer option two and that is to close< close out for a loss which is much close out for a loss which is much lesser< lesser than the max loss because lesser than the max loss because remember< remember there is still extrinsic value remember there is still extrinsic value right< right in your this put spread because right in your this put spread because there's< there's still time before it expires so there's still time before it expires so when< when you close it out it will definitely when you close it out it will definitely be< be lesser than the max loss so that is be lesser than the max loss so that is why< why it's better than you just exercise why it's better than you just exercise this< this long put if you exercise this Long this long put if you exercise this Long Point< Point you're immediately telling the Point you're immediately telling the broker< broker you want to realize the max loss broker you want to realize the max loss which< which is not the best choice right the which is not the best choice right the better< better choice would be to unwind this better choice would be to unwind this close< close out your put spread save those few close out your put spread save those few bucks< bucks right where you. could you know use bucks right where you could you know use it< it for the next trade so then once to it for the next trade so then once to close< close up for a loss just wait for close up for a loss just wait for another< another opportunity remember you win another opportunity remember you win some< some you lose some over the long term as some you lose some over the long term as long< long as you have the right mechanics long as you have the right mechanics it's< it's going to work out for you okay so it's going to work out for you okay so the< the next question to bring about this is the next question to bring about this is how< how to actually prevent this whole mess how to actually prevent this whole mess in< in the first place because it gets a in the first place because it gets a little< little bit messy when you start to get little bit messy when you start to get assigned< assigned on your blue put spread so assigned on your blue put spread so rather< rather than you know trying to cure it rather than you know trying to cure it we< we want prevention that is why that's we want prevention that is why that's the< the same prevention always better than the same prevention always better than having< having a cure right so how do you reduce having a cure right so how do you reduce the< the risk of early assignment well two the risk of early assignment well two answers< answers to this the first one is just answers to this the first one is just exit< exit at 21 days to expiration basically exit at 21 days to expiration basically just< just means that there's 21 days to the just means that there's 21 days to the expiration< expiration of the options of course you expiration of the options of course you do< do this only when the shot put lake is do this only when the shot put lake is in< in the money if it's out of the money in the money if it's out of the money then< then there's no need for you to do then there's no need for you to do anything< anything right because there's no risk anything right because there's no risk for< for early assignment at the same time for early assignment at the same time when< when you exit at 21 DTE as you can see when you exit at 21 DTE as you can see this< this is a study that I've shown before this is a study that I've shown before that< that when you exited turn on DTE you that when you exited turn on DTE you still< still get a superior performance then still get a superior performance then holding< holding into exploration so there's no holding into exploration so there's no real< real need for you to hold all the way to real need for you to hold all the way to expiration< expiration now the second answer is to expiration now the second answer is to avoid< avoid all this early assignment what you avoid all this early assignment what you could< could do is just to trade the cash could do is just to trade the cash settle< settle index options right for example settle index options right for example the< the SPX XSP and the X rod and Rod and so the SPX XSP and the X rod and Rod and so on< on and so forth right so basically with on and so forth right so basically with cash< cash shuttle index options these are cash shuttle index options these are what< what you call European style options so what you call European style options so I< I mentioned this as well in a number of I mentioned this as well in a number of my< my videos so basically European style my videos so basically European style options< options are the opposite of what you options are the opposite of what you call< call the American style options on those call the American style options on those you< you know index ETFs and as well as your you know index ETFs and as well as your stocks< stocks right your equities so when you stocks right your equities so when you trade< trade the European style index options trade the European style index options or< or other European style options or other European style options what< what happens is that there is no early what happens is that there is no early assignment< assignment so if there's no early assignment so if there's no early assignment< assignment you can actually take this assignment you can actually take this whole< whole spread all the way to expiration whole spread all the way to expiration right< right even though there's maybe like right even though there's maybe like three< three days left or maybe even one day three days left or maybe even one day left< left you don't have to worry about early left you don't have to worry about early assignment< assignment because this is a European assignment because this is a European style< style option so what happens is that style option so what happens is that expiration< expiration they'll see that whether expiration they'll see that whether you're< you're in a profit of a loss and they you're in a profit of a loss and they will< will tabulate that and then they will will tabulate that and then they will put< put it into your bank balance right if put it into your bank balance right if you< you lose money you'll be taken off your you lose money you'll be taken off your balance< balance if you're going to make money balance if you're going to make money they're< they're going to put a credit into your they're going to put a credit into your trading< trading account balance so guys if you trading account balance so guys if you are< are afraid of getting an early are afraid of getting an early assignment< assignment then exit at 21 DTE or just assignment then exit at 21 DTE or just simply< simply trade the cash shuttle index simply trade the cash shuttle index options< options and you will have no worries options and you will have no worries about< about getting any early assignment by about getting any early assignment by the< the way if you like this video then the way if you like this video then you're< you're absolutely going to love this you're absolutely going to love this next< next video

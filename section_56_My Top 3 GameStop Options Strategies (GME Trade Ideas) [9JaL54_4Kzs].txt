========================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video I all right alrighty so in today's video I have< have a special request video from you have a special request video from you guys< guys and that is to cover GameStop right guys and that is to cover GameStop right so< so GameStop has been in the news so GameStop has been in the news recently< recently the market has shut up then it recently the market has shut up then it came< came back down I've had quite a number came back down I've had quite a number of< of people that you know have asked me of people that you know have asked me hey< hey Davis can you cover GameStop can you hey Davis can you cover GameStop can you talk< talk about some option strategies to talk about some option strategies to trade< trade on GameStop and that is why I trade on GameStop and that is why I decided< decided to create this video now I want decided to create this video now I want to< to say that I do not trade GameStop I to say that I do not trade GameStop I think< think that there are better stocks out think that there are better stocks out there< there better you know underlyings out there better you know underlyings out there< there to trade than GameStop with that there to trade than GameStop with that said< said if I were to trade GameStop this is said if I were to trade GameStop this is how< how I would trade it so first of all the how I would trade it so first of all the very< very first thing I want to do whenever very first thing I want to do whenever I'm< I'm trading any individual stock is to I'm trading any individual stock is to find< find out you know what is this company find out you know what is this company that< that I'm trading right because each that I'm trading right because each stock< stock that you're trading is actually a stock that you're trading is actually a company< company so the first thing I want to company so the first thing I want to find< find out is this a fundamentally good find out is this a fundamentally good stock< stock right so one of the ways that I stock right so one of the ways that I like< like to find out whether it's a like to find out whether it's a fundamentally< fundamentally good stock or not is to fundamentally good stock or not is to take< take a look at the financials for the take a look at the financials for the past< past 5 years right to see whether it's past 5 years right to see whether it's actually< actually making money so as you can see actually making money so as you can see down< down here GameStop has not been making down here GameStop has not been making money< money right you can see that the revenue money right you can see that the revenue is< is quite inconsistent and the only thing is quite inconsistent and the only thing that< that is consistent is that it has been that is consistent is that it has been losing< losing money right it has been losing losing money right it has been losing money< money for about 5 years straight so 2024 money for about 5 years straight so 2024 hasn't< hasn't exactly ended we're not sure how hasn't exactly ended we're not sure how it's< it's going to pan out but just by it's going to pan out but just by looking< looking at this you know that chances looking at this you know that chances are< are that it probably could lose money as are that it probably could lose money as well< well so this is not one of those stocks well so this is not one of those stocks that< that I will categorize as fundamental Al that I will categorize as fundamental Al good< good stock and for me this is uh good stock and for me this is uh important< important to classify because if it's a important to classify because if it's a fundamentally< fundamentally good stock then I might fundamentally good stock then I might want< want to trade it for a longer term want to trade it for a longer term certain< certain strategies that I want to apply certain strategies that I want to apply to< to it as well as compared to other to it as well as compared to other stocks< stocks right so for GameStop it's not stocks right so for GameStop it's not one< one of them so I will have more of a you one of them so I will have more of a you know< know kind of strategy whereby I may just know kind of strategy whereby I may just trade< trade it a few times but not one that trade it a few times but not one that I'll< I'll regularly keep on putting on you I'll regularly keep on putting on you know< know strategies over and over again so know strategies over and over again so remember< remember whenever we are trading options remember whenever we are trading options on< on any underlying there are two things on any underlying there are two things that< that needs to match with each other so that needs to match with each other so the< the first one is the underlying right the first one is the underlying right you< you need to have an understanding of the you need to have an understanding of the underlying< underlying and then you need to suit the underlying and then you need to suit the option< option strategy to this underline that option strategy to this underline that is< is to say that not every strategy is is to say that not every strategy is suitable< suitable for all types of underlying so suitable for all types of underlying so that< that is why for GameStop I need to First that is why for GameStop I need to First understand< understand what is so from here I can understand what is so from here I can kind< kind of understand that you know I may kind of understand that you know I may not< not be that biased to just only the not be that biased to just only the upside< upside for example if it's the upside for example if it's the fundamentally< fundamentally good stock like for fundamentally good stock like for example< example Amazon and Google then those are example Amazon and Google then those are the< the stocks that you know I may trade the stocks that you know I may trade much< much more bullish strategies but for much more bullish strategies but for GameStop< GameStop doesn't seem that way so far GameStop doesn't seem that way so far right< right so the next thing that I want to right so the next thing that I want to look< look at is the. chart I want to take a look at is the chart I want to take a look< look at how the prices has been look at how the prices has been performing< performing you know recently so as you performing you know recently so as you can< can see down here the market has can see down here the market has actually< actually been you know not really doing actually been you know not really doing much< much for you know quite some time and much for you know quite some time and then< then all of a sudden the market shut up then all of a sudden the market shut up and< and then the market came back down so and then the market came back down so straight< straight away this tells me that this straight away this tells me that this stock< stock seems to be very very volatile in stock seems to be very very volatile in the< the sense where out of the blue it can the sense where out of the blue it can suddenly< suddenly shoot up right because this is suddenly shoot up right because this is a< a meme stock right so the reason this a meme stock right so the reason this really< really shot up was because of just one really shot up was because of just one person< person right so this influencer named person right so this influencer named roaring< roaring Kitty as you can see down here roaring Kitty as you can see down here whenever< whenever he would you know tweet on the whenever he would you know tweet on the this< this GameStop this is where you know he this GameStop this is where you know he will< will have this huge search right so as will have this huge search right so as you< you can see down here uh his bull tweets you can see down here uh his bull tweets and< and live streams helped Drive the 2021 m and live streams helped Drive the 2021 m stock< stock search and then recently same stock search and then recently same thing< thing as well I think he talked about it thing as well I think he talked about it and< and then he went silent right as you can and then he went silent right as you can see< see down here uh through his recent see down here uh through his recent silent< silent has coincided with a noticeable silent has coincided with a noticeable price< price dip for the meme stock so down price dip for the meme stock so down here< here you can see that this stock is one here you can see that this stock is one of< of those stocks where I consider an of those stocks where I consider an explosive< explosive stock where it can just explosive stock where it can just suddenly< suddenly just shoot up out of the blue suddenly just shoot up out of the blue right< right and it seems that the risk is more right and it seems that the risk is more to< to the upside rather than to the to the upside rather than to the downside< downside because at least from what we downside because at least from what we can< can see down here when the market comes can see down here when the market comes down< down right during this period of time down right during this period of time it's< it's not as violent as this move up here it's not as violent as this move up here right< right it's such a huge move so that is right it's such a huge move so that is why< why you know I would probably air more why you know I would probably air more towards< towards a more bullish kind of a trade towards a more bullish kind of a trade unless< unless the market has you know gone up unless the market has you know gone up quite< quite a bit right but for now at this quite a bit right but for now at this current< current price down here I would say this current price down here I would say this is< is where I would rather go more bullish is where I would rather go more bullish rather< rather than bearish now if you were to rather than bearish now if you were to take< take a look at this as well this is a take a look at this as well this is a tweet< tweet by unusual whals uh recently tweet by unusual whals uh recently uh< uh this GameStop options right you can uh this GameStop options right you can see< see that the calls have really ballooned see that the calls have really ballooned up< up in the IV right it's has gone over up in the IV right it's has gone over 1,000%< 1,000% and that really is very crazy 1,000% and that really is very crazy right< right if you have something that's right if you have something that's 1,000%< 1,000% then you know that the kind of 1,000% then you know that the kind of price< price movement is insane right so you price movement is insane right so you can< can see if the price really shot up from can see if the price really shot up from this< this point down here from $16 it shot up this point down here from $16 it shot up all< all the way to over $64 that is like how all the way to over $64 that is like how many< many times right I think maybe about many times right I think maybe about four< four times or or so something like that four times or or so something like that so< so if you happen to catch it before you so if you happen to catch it before you know< know this big move then of course you know this big move then of course you definitely< definitely want to get out very quickly definitely want to get out very quickly but< but at this point of time I think the but at this point of time I think the market< market has come down and the volatility market has come down and the volatility is< is not that high anymore right so I was is not that high anymore right so I was uh< uh taking a look at the option chain and uh taking a look at the option chain and you< you can see the IV on the right hand you can see the IV on the right hand side< side of the option chain right most side of the option chain right most option< option chain should actually show that option chain should actually show that so< so for this I'm using actually the think so for this I'm using actually the think of< of Swing platform so you can see down of Swing platform so you can see down here< here the IV is actually around 100 plus here the IV is actually around 100 plus per. < per.

right it has come down from a th000 per. right it has come down from a th000 over< over perc but then is not to say that over perc but then is not to say that this< this is still not high it still can be this is still not high it still can be considered< considered you know High compared to you considered you know High compared to you know< know some of the underlyings that I'm know some of the underlyings that I'm used< used to trading like for example the used to trading like for example the index< index ETFs index ETFs are much much index ETFs index ETFs are much much lower< lower than that now the next thing that lower than that now the next thing that I< I like to look at as well is the option I like to look at as well is the option chain< chain right I want to see how is the bli chain right I want to see how is the bli andr< andr spread on this option chain so as andr spread on this option chain so as you< you can see down here the bli andr you can see down here the bli andr spread< spread at the at the money options right spread at the at the money options right let's< let's take a look at the put down here let's take a look at the put down here you< you can see it's about 30 cents wide you can see it's about 30 cents wide right< right that is is close to about 10% of right that is is close to about 10% of the< the uh price of the BNR so that is the uh price of the BNR so that is pretty< pretty substantial right even down here pretty substantial right even down here as< as well even the at the money cost about as well even the at the money cost about 30< 30 cents or so and it could get even 30 cents or so and it could get even wider< wider right over down here maybe about wider right over down here maybe about 50< 50 cents as you go further out of the 50 cents as you go further out of the money< money right so for me I feel that this money right so for me I feel that this BNR< BNR spread is a little bit wider than BNR spread is a little bit wider than you< you know what I'm really used to because you know what I'm really used to because if< if I was to just to compare with a if I was to just to compare with a similar< similar price stock let's say for similar price stock let's say for example< example paler right you can see the example paler right you can see the paler< paler is roughly around $24 as of this paler is roughly around $24 as of this recording< recording gam stop is around $23 so they recording gam stop is around $23 so they are< are pretty similar but if you were to are pretty similar but if you were to take< take a look at palente um their Bon take a look at palente um their Bon spread< spread all right let's take a look at spread all right let's take a look at the< the put s side you can see that it's the put s side you can see that it's only< only 2 cents wide right 2 cents wide out only 2 cents wide right 2 cents wide out of< of uh roughly about $2 that is almost of uh roughly about $2 that is almost close< close to about 1% kind of uh weightage close to about 1% kind of uh weightage on< on the whole uh price of the B us right on the whole uh price of the B us right so< so you can see it doesn't take that much so you can see it doesn't take that much uh< uh same thing on the call as well right uh same thing on the call as well right only< only 3 cents so it is considered pretty only 3 cents so it is considered pretty tight< tight compared to GameStop so what does tight compared to GameStop so what does this< this tell me so this tells me that I this tell me so this tells me that I will< will try and avoid trading those will try and avoid trading those multi-legged< multi-legged strategies and multile multi-legged strategies and multile strategies< strategies like for example maybe the strategies like for example maybe the butterfly< butterfly or even the iron Condor or butterfly or even the iron Condor or anything< anything that has three or four legs anything that has three or four legs right< right maybe the most that I will go for right maybe the most that I will go for is< is just two legs right preferably if you is just two legs right preferably if you can< can go just for for one leg that's fine can go just for for one leg that's fine because< because if you were to enter and exit because if you were to enter and exit the< the trade there would be two times right the trade there would be two times right you< you enter one time you exit another time you enter one time you exit another time you< you will be actually losing out quite a you will be actually losing out quite a bit< bit on the spread right so remember when bit on the spread right so remember when we< we are trading uh the options not only we are trading uh the options not only are< are the commissions involved right if are the commissions involved right if you< you go for Robin Hood yes there's no you go for Robin Hood yes there's no commissions< commissions but you also have to take a commissions but you also have to take a look< look at the spread right so you can see look at the spread right so you can see that< that this spread is going to take quite that this spread is going to take quite a< a big chunk of your profit if you're a big chunk of your profit if you're going< going to make any profit and it's going going to make any profit and it's going to< to add on to your losses as well well so to add on to your losses as well well so as< as a rule of time generally I do not as a rule of time generally I do not like< like to trade uh stocks whereby the like to trade uh stocks whereby the options< options the bitr spread is pretty wide options the bitr spread is pretty wide right< right anything I think above 5 to 10% of right anything I think above 5 to 10% of the< the BNR spread I think that is the BNR spread I think that is considered< considered pretty wide right so with considered pretty wide right so with that< that said let's try and figure out you that said let's try and figure out you know< know what kind of strategies we can know what kind of strategies we can trade< trade on GameStop so the next thing I trade on GameStop so the next thing I also< also like to take a look at is the also like to take a look at is the weekly< weekly chart so I want to zoom it out to weekly chart so I want to zoom it out to take< take a look at a much bigger time frame take a look at a much bigger time frame to< to take a look at you know how the stock to take a look at you know how the stock has< has been performing for a longer time has been performing for a longer time right< right so this is over the past I think right so this is over the past I think about< about four to 5 years down here right about four to 5 years down here right four< four to 5 years and you can see that four to 5 years and you can see that over< over four to five years the market looks over four to five years the market looks really< really like a vix chart right if you really like a vix chart right if you have< have taken a look at the vix chart it's have taken a look at the vix chart it's pretty< pretty much like this it's almost like pretty much like this it's almost like it's< it's mean reverting so to speak right it's mean reverting so to speak right Market< Market will go up come down go up come Market will go up come down go up come down< down and then staying low for a while go down and then staying low for a while go up< up and then come down again so this is up and then come down again so this is not< not one of those stocks like I mentioned not one of those stocks like I mentioned like< like the fundamentally good stocks or like the fundamentally good stocks or the< the index ETFs right those kind of the index ETFs right those kind of stocks< stocks you will find the pattern is stocks you will find the pattern is where< where the market is going to keep going where the market is going to keep going up< up right in those cases you can position up right in those cases you can position certain< certain strategies more towards those certain strategies more towards those kind< kind of charting patterns but for this kind of charting patterns but for this GameStop< GameStop from what I can see is that the GameStop from what I can see is that the risk< risk really is pretty much to the upside risk really is pretty much to the. upside as< as of this point down here right so let as of this point down here right so let me< me just remove all the drawing down here me just remove all the drawing down here you< you can see in the past four to five you can see in the past four to five years< years the low is somewhere around here years the low is somewhere around here right< right somewhere $1 to $15 that's around right somewhere $1 to $15 that's around maybe< maybe the range maybe even to $20 so maybe the range maybe even to $20 so during< during at this pricing at this price during at this pricing at this price down< down here the RIS tends to be more on down here the RIS tends to be more on the< the upside because you can see that you the upside because you can see that you know< know the market can shoot up like that know the market can shoot up like that right< right just suddenly just have a a shoot right just suddenly just have a a shoot up< up in price uh much more than if the up in price uh much more than if the market< market was to go down right same thing market was to go down right same thing over< over here so now because the price is over here so now because the price is roughly< roughly around 23 24 odd dollars I would roughly around 23 24 odd dollars I would say< say the risk is much more to the upside say the risk is much more to the upside so< so that means I do not want to really go so that means I do not want to really go you< you know where I'm playing you know where I'm playing the< the market to the downside I do not want the market to the downside I do not want to< to play GameStop to the downside because to play GameStop to the downside because it< it doesn't seem like there's too much it doesn't seem like there's too much room< room at least from history right from room at least from history right from the< the historical prices so with that said the historical prices so with that said I'm< I'm more inclined to put on bullish I'm more inclined to put on bullish strategies< strategies at this current price all strategies at this current price all right< right so what other strategies that I'll right so what other strategies that I'll put< put on so I'm going to share with you put on so I'm going to share with you three< three bullish option strategies that you three bullish option strategies that you can< can use on GameStop at the current price can use on GameStop at the current price now< now before we put on any bullish options now before we put on any bullish options strategies< strategies the first thing is that we strategies the first thing is that we want< want to have a setup that kind of favors want to have a setup that kind of favors our< our bullish option strategies so what our bullish option strategies so what kind< kind of setup do we want to look out for kind of setup do we want to look out for so< so uh if you're just new to trading so uh if you're just new to trading options< options then I would suggest you know a options then I would suggest you know a very< very simple way to identify you know a very simple way to identify you know a better< better chance uh at least a higher better chance uh at least a higher probability< probability of the market wanting to go probability of the market wanting to go up< up than to go down and that will be up than to go down and that will be through< through two things right so the very through two things right so the very first< first thing is to identify the oversold first thing is to identify the oversold condition< condition on stochastic right so as you condition on stochastic right so as you can< can see down here this is the stochastic can see down here this is the stochastic indicator< indicator what it does is that it indicator what it does is that it identifies< identifies you know overbought and over identifies you know overbought and over soak< soak condition if it goes above this soak condition if it goes above this line< line down here this is where it's line down here this is where it's considered< considered overboard right so usually considered overboard right so usually when< when it's overboard price tend to come when it's overboard price tend to come down< down more often than not and once it's down more often than not and once it's oversold< oversold the price tends to go up now oversold the price tends to go up now again< again I will say this in many of this again I will say this in many of this videos< videos that I talk about stochastic is videos that I talk about stochastic is that< that this is not some magic indicator that this is not some magic indicator that< that every time it's oversold the market that every time it's oversold the market will< will will definitely go up or every time will will definitely go up or every time it's< it's overbo the market definitely go it's overbo the market definitely go down< down right there'll be times where it's down right there'll be times where it's overboard< overboard it will continue to be overboard it will continue to be overboard< overboard if it's oversold it will overboard if it's oversold it will continue< continue to be oversold but if you were continue to be oversold but if you were to< to just look at this which one is a much to just look at this which one is a much more< more strategic point for you to enter more strategic point for you to enter into< into a bullish position when it's into a bullish position when it's oversold< oversold or when it's overbought right oversold or when it's overbought right so< so definitely when it's oversold so that so definitely when it's oversold so that is< is the first condition that we want to is the first condition that we want to look< look out for now the next one is to try look out for now the next one is to try and< and identify support levels right so and identify support levels right so support< support levels are basically Bally just support levels are basically Bally just prices< prices or levels where you see that the prices or levels where you see that the price< price have kind of bounced off right so price have kind of bounced off right so as< as you can see down here there's a two as you can see down here there's a two levels< levels that you can look at so the very levels that you can look at so the very first< first level at the top you can see over first level at the top you can see over here< here the price kind of you hesitated here the price kind of you hesitated going< going up right there was some sort of going up right there was some sort of resistance< resistance there and as you know resistance there and as you know there'll< there'll be times where when the there'll be times where when the resistance< resistance is broken through it becomes resistance is broken through it becomes support< support right so as you can see down support right so as you can see down here< here it broke through and then it came here it broke through and then it came back< back down it found support the market uh back down it found support the market uh momentarily< momentarily went up again now the market momentarily went up again now the market is< is coming down so at this point of time is coming down so at this point of time we've< we've identified the overso conditions we've identified the overso conditions we< we have identified the support levels we have identified the support levels now< now we can you know place our strategies now we can you know place our strategies more< more strategically right at least this more strategically right at least this way< way we will find it much more way we will find it much more comfortable< comfortable or at least slightly more comfortable or at least slightly more safer< safer than if we were to randomly just safer than if we were to randomly just place< place our bullish strategies on right so place our bullish strategies on right so what< what is the very first strategy that you what is the very first strategy that you can< can consider putting on on Gamestop by can consider putting on on Gamestop by the< the way if you like this video so far the way if you like this

com blueprint all right back with davis. com blueprint all right back to< to the video so the very first strategy to the video so the very first strategy would< would be a very simple one would just be would be a very simple one would just be the< the wheel strategy right so the wheel the wheel strategy right so the wheel strategy< strategy uh just consists of two simple strategy uh just consists of two simple strategies< strategies number one just sell the cash strategies number one just sell the cash secure< secure put so the whole idea here is to secure put so the whole idea here is to get< get into the stocks right so if you are get into the stocks right so if you are maybe< maybe also punting on the fact that maybe also punting on the fact that maybe< maybe all of a sudden you know if a maybe all of a sudden you know if a roaring< roaring Kitty was to come up with one of roaring Kitty was to come up with one of those< those uh tweets again the market is those uh tweets again the market is going< going to shoot up then you could going to shoot up then you could actually< actually sell a cash put and then have a actually sell a cash put and then have a long< long position right so if you sell a long position right so if you sell a cash< cash put let's say for example you get cash put let's say for example you get fi< fi on it you could hold on to the stocks fi on it you could hold on to the stocks as< as well if you hold on to the stocks as well if you hold on to the stocks it's< it's not going to be that big of a risk it's not going to be that big of a risk right< right because let's say for example if right because let's say for example if you< you were to sell a cash secure putut you were to sell a cash secure putut below< below this support level let's say below this support level let's say roughly< roughly around $16 then what's the max roughly around $16 then what's the max you< you can lose right the mexic can lose is you can lose right the mexic can lose is $11,600< $11,600 if GameStop goes bankrupt right $11,600 if GameStop goes bankrupt right so< so that's not too much on your pocket so that's not too much on your pocket right< right compared to you know some of the right compared to you know some of the much< much more expensive stock now of course much more expensive stock now of course if< if you find 1,600 a little bit too much if you find 1,600 a little bit too much then< then of course maybe this strategy is then of course maybe this strategy is not< not for you but if you were to take a not for you but if you were to take a look< look at the upside the upside seems to look at the upside the upside seems to be< be much higher right for example if be much higher right for example if let's< let's say for example you could actually let's say for example you could actually get< get F at $16 and roaring Kitty comes up get F at $16 and roaring Kitty comes up with< with one of those uh tweets again and with one of those uh tweets again and the< the market really shoots up you can see the market really shoots up you can see that< that it shoots all the way up to about that it shoots all the way up to about 60< 60 plus then you have many times the 60 plus then you have many times the risk< risk that you put on for this trade so risk that you put on for this trade so like< like I said this is where I would only like I said this is where I would only go< go you know put on bullish strategies go you know put on bullish strategies rather< rather than bearish strategies as of rather than bearish strategies as of this< this point so back to the wheel strategy this point so back to the wheel strategy so< so after you sell the cash secure output so after you sell the cash secure output if< if you get assigned then the next thing if you get assigned then the next thing you< you want to do is to sell the covered you want to do is to sell the covered car< car because this isn't one of those car because this isn't one of those stocks< stocks where you want to hold on to it stocks where you want to hold on to it forever< forever at least from my standpoint why forever at least from my standpoint why is< is that so because this is not a is that so because this is not a fundamentally< fundamentally good stock right that fundamentally good stock right that means< means to say the earnings have not been means to say the earnings have not been increasing< increasing and that also you know kind increasing and that also you know kind of< of translate to the price right the the of translate to the price right the the charts< charts as as you can see if you take a charts as as you can see if you take a look< look at Google Amazon all this look at Google Amazon all this fundamentally< fundamentally good stocks you can see fundamentally good stocks you can see that< that the prices has just kept going up that the prices has just kept going up and< and up and up and up so those are kind and up and up and up so those are kind of< of stocks where you could consider of stocks where you could consider holding< holding on to the stocks for a longer holding on to the stocks for a longer period< period of time but for GameStop I think period of time but for GameStop I think this< this is one of those hit and run get in this is one of those hit and run get in get< get out and then you know wait to see if get out and then you know wait to see if there's< there's any other opportunities rather there's any other opportunities rather than< than you know constantly put on the than you know constantly put on the strategies< strategies over and over again now how strategies over and over again now how will< will you actually position the cash will you actually position the cash secure< secure output so I taken a look at the secure output so I taken a look at the uh< uh option chain down here you can see uh option chain down here you can see this< this is the put option chain you can see this is the put option chain you can see down< down here if you were to sell the cash C down here if you were to sell the cash C putut< putut at putut at 16< 16 then you will see that the kind of 16 then you will see that the kind of amount< amount that you will get is actually not amount that you will get is actually not that< that much maybe about $45 right per cash that much maybe about $45 right per cash secure< secure put so if. you think it's a little secure put so if you think it's a little bit< bit too little what do you do right so bit too little what do you do right so one< one thing you can simply do is just wait one thing you can simply do is just wait right< right wait for the market to actually right wait for the market to actually come< come down a little bit lower once it come down a little bit lower once it gets< gets closer to where the support is then gets closer to where the support is then you< you can start to sell the cash secure you can start to sell the cash secure put< put right you want to sell it at a put right you want to sell it at a strike< strike price that maybe you feel strike price that maybe you feel comfortable< comfortable owning or the other way is comfortable owning or the other way is to< to maybe look at the Delta right so if to maybe look at the Delta right so if you< you were to take a look at this this the you were to take a look at this this the reason< reason why you know the uh premium is reason why you know the uh premium is not< not that much although it's actually not that much although it's actually quite< quite a bit already for most stocks of quite a bit already for most stocks of this< this price because the IV is actually this price because the IV is actually pretty< pretty high inflating the premiums but pretty high inflating the premiums but if< if you want to get a little bit more if you want to get a little bit more premium< premium then you want to position at a premium then you want to position at a slightly< slightly higher Delta right so maybe if slightly higher Delta right so maybe if you< you were to go somewhere around down you were to go somewhere around down here< here then you would see that you would here then you would see that you would get< get much more premiums right so the way get much more premiums right so the way to< to get this higher premium at the same to get this higher premium at the same strike< strike price at 16 is to just wait for strike price at 16 is to just wait for the< the market to come down right if the the market to come down right if the stock< stock comes down then you can choose to stock comes down then you can choose to sell< sell at $16 then once it's assigned then sell at $16 then once it's assigned then this< this is where you can wait until you this is where you can wait until you know< know at a suable place that you want to know at a suable place that you want to get< get out of this stock NOW the next get out of this stock NOW the next strategy< strategy would be the put credit sprad strategy would be the put credit sprad right< right so if you do not have enough risk right so if you do not have enough risk to< to put on let's say for example you feel to put on let's say for example you feel 1,600< 1,600 is a little bit too big you want 1,600 is a little bit too big you want to< to risk something lesser then you can go to risk something lesser then you can go for< for the put credit spread right put for the put credit spread right put credit< credit spread basically if the market credit spread basically if the market goes< goes all the way to zero you don't have goes all the way to zero you don't have to< to worry because you already have this to worry because you already have this long< long put in place right this long put long put in place right this long put basically< basically just covers the max loss on basically just covers the max loss on your< your end so if you feel the wheel your end so if you feel the wheel strategy< strategy is a little bit too Capital strategy is a little bit too Capital intensive< intensive for you or you do not want to intensive for you or you do not want to put< put that much risk onto this trade then put that much risk onto this trade then you< you might want to consider the put you might want to consider the put credit< credit spread because with the put credit spread because with the put credit< credit spread you can go for a smaller credit spread you can go for a smaller risk< risk right at the same time you also risk right at the same time you also still< still can have your bullish Outlook now still can have your bullish Outlook now the< the third and final strategy that you the third and final strategy that you can< can consider putting on GameStop and can consider putting on GameStop and that< that would be the call debit spread that would be the call debit spread right< right so this is also known as The Bull right so this is also known as The Bull call< call spread so the call debit spread is call spread so the call debit spread is slightly< slightly different from most of the slightly different from most of the strategies< strategies that you have seen on my strategies that you have seen on my channel< channel in a sense whereby most of the channel in a sense whereby most of the time< time we are receiving the credit up time we are receiving the credit up front< front right we're getting paid to put on front right we're getting paid to put on the< the trade whereas for the call debit the trade whereas for the call debit spread< spread it's the opposite you actually spread it's the opposite you actually have< have to pay it out right so it will be a have to pay it out right so it will be a debit< debit you have to pay for it and for debit you have to pay for it and for this< this I actually do like the call deit this I actually do like the call deit spread< spread for GameStop mainly because of spread for GameStop mainly because of the< the way it's being structured on the the way it's being structured on the option< option chain so before I get into that option chain so before I get into that now< now the first thing I want to get into now the first thing I want to get into is< is how would you get into call deit is how would you get into call deit spread< spread so at this current price you can spread so at this current price you can just< just simply put it on right what I would just simply put it on right what I would do< do is put the at the money called debit do is put the at the money called debit spread< spread so that means you want the uh spread so that means you want the uh long< long call at roughly where the current long call at roughly where the current market< market price is right so if the current market price is right so if the current market< market price is around 23.

6 5 you could market price is around 23. 6 5 you could consider< consider putting somewhere around $24 consider putting somewhere around $24 and< and then up here for the short call this and then up here for the short call this is< is where you know you limit your max is where you know you limit your max profit< profit now it's definitely better than profit now it's definitely better than just< just buying a call outright because if just buying a call outright because if you< you were to buy the call outright you were to buy the call outright firstly< firstly it's going to be a little bit firstly it's going to be a little bit expensive< expensive right because uh Theta is expensive right because uh Theta is going< going to really Decay your option very going to really Decay your option very quickly< quickly and also the IV is pretty high quickly and also the IV is pretty high so< so the best way to get into a debit kind so the best way to get into a debit kind of< of a position would be to use a spread of a position would be to use a spread right< right so call debit spread so this is right so call debit spread so this is where< where you can put your short call you where you can put your short call you know< know at a place where you know you think know at a place where you know you think it's< it's going to you know jump too right if it's going to you know jump too right if you< you want you can just go for $5 wide you want you can just go for $5 wide spread< spread $10 wide spread or however you spread $10 wide spread or however you know< know how far you think the uh GameStop know how far you think the uh GameStop can< can go right so this is one option that can go right so this is one option that you< you can put on at the moment right now you can put on at the moment right now now< now the other way is that you could just now the other way is that you could just wait< wait for the market to come down first wait for the market to come down first close< close enough to where the support is and close enough to where the support is and then< then you enter into the call debit then you enter into the call debit spread< spread right alternatively if you're a spread right alternatively if you're a little< little bit more conservative you can little bit more conservative you can wait< wait until the market goes down to the wait until the market goes down to the second< second support area then you place the second support area then you place the at< at the money call debit spread now I at the money call debit spread now I kind< kind of like the call debit spread for kind of like the call debit spread for GameStop< GameStop and the reason is because of GameStop and the reason is because of the< the structure you can get with the call the structure you can get with the call debit< debit spread so if you were to take a debit spread so if you were to take a look< look at the option chain so let's just look at the option chain so let's just say< say you were to craft and add the money say you were to craft and add the money call< call debit spread so maybe you go for call debit spread so maybe you go for the< the 24 and then you just construct it the 24 and then you just construct it five< five point wide you notice something five point wide you notice something that< that is slightly different from what you that is slightly different from what you know< know you would get if you were to put on know you would get if you were to put on like< like the index ETFs right for example like the index ETFs right for example for< for this down here you notice for the at for this down here you notice for the at M< M call debit spread you can get a risk M call debit spread you can get a risk reward< reward ratio of roughly 1 is to 4 very reward ratio of roughly 1 is to 4 very close< close right you can see the risk is close right you can see the risk is slightly< slightly above $100 and you get you know slightly above $100 and you get you know very< very close to $400 so it's close to one very close to $400 so it's close to one is< is to four which is pretty good right is to four which is pretty good right because< because this is something that you because this is something that you cannot< cannot get on the index ETFs like for cannot get on the index ETFs like for example< example spy right if you take a look at example spy right if you take a look at spy< spy right now at this current price if spy right now at this current price if you< you were to go for the same e money call you were to go for the same e money call spread< spread and also $5 White spread and also $5 White what< what you will notice is that the risk to what you will notice is that the risk to reward< reward is actually less than one is to reward is actually less than one is to one< one right you can see over here the risk one right you can see over here the risk is< is close to about $300 and your profit is close to about $300 and your profit is< is only $200 so your risk reward is like is only $200 so your risk reward is like you're< you're risking a dollar to make roughly you're risking a dollar to make roughly about< about 067 cents or something like that about 067 cents or something like that and< and the reason it's like this is because and the reason it's like this is because spy< spy has what you call a put skill right spy has what you call a put skill right if< if you have a put skill then your call if you have a put skill then your call site< site is going to be not that good right site is going to be not that good right because< because you don't get the kind of risk because you don't get the kind of risk reward< reward but if you were to put the put reward but if you were to put the put debit< debit spread on spy then you will get a debit spread on spy then you will get a very< very similar construct as this one down very similar construct as. this one down here< here so why is it that GameStop has this here so why is it that GameStop has this construct< construct for the call side and the construct for the call side and the reason< reason is because GameStop has call reason is because GameStop has call skill< skill so basically uh the call are skill so basically uh the call are trading< trading at a richer premium compared to trading at a richer premium compared to the< the put side right so as you can see the put side right so as you can see down< down here when you construct the call down here when you construct the call debit< debit spread you actually have a pretty debit spread you actually have a pretty good< good risk reward ratio and also one good good risk reward ratio and also one good thing< thing about GameStop is that okay thing about GameStop is that okay occasionally< occasionally right the market can just occasionally right the market can just all< all of a sudden just shoot all the way all of a sudden just shoot all the way to< to the top so you don't risk that much to the top so you don't risk that much whenever< whenever you're just you know just whenever you're just you know just punting< punting on it speculating maybe there's punting on it speculating maybe there's going< going to be a shoot up and then if it going to be a shoot up and then if it does< does shoot up hey you can get a pretty does shoot up hey you can get a pretty good< good risk to reward ratio all right so good risk to reward ratio all right so to< to sum things up at this current to sum things up at this current situation< situation of GameStop at least from my situation of GameStop at least from my perspective< perspective I think you can consider perspective I think you can consider putting< putting on these three strategies right putting on these three strategies right so< so the very first strategy is the wheel so the very first strategy is the wheel strategy< strategy so if you feel that you want to strategy so if you feel that you want to get< get into the shares and hold on to it get into the shares and hold on to it for< for some time in case you know roaring for some time in case you know roaring Kitty< Kitty comes up with a tweet again and Kitty comes up with a tweet again and the< the market is to shoot up then you can the market is to shoot up then you can use< use the wheel strategy but if you don't use the wheel strategy but if you don't want< want to put that much capital and you want to put that much capital and you want< want to you know have a lesser risk then want to you know have a lesser risk then you< you can consider putting on the put you can consider putting on the put credit< credit spread right so with the put credit spread right so with the put credit< credit spread you'll receive uh credit credit spread you'll receive uh credit up< up front and you will have a pretty up front and you will have a pretty decently< decently High win rate that is above 50% decently High win rate that is above 50% again< again depends on where you position your again depends on where you position your put< put credit spread but if you feel that put credit spread but if you feel that hey< hey you do not like the risk reward then hey you do not like the risk reward then you< you can go for the third one which is a you can go for the third one which is a call< call debit spread so with the call debit call debit spread so with the call debit spread< spread you have a slightly lower win spread you have a slightly lower win rate< rate it's roughly around 50% win rate if rate it's roughly around 50% win rate if you're< you're going for at the money call you're going for at the money call debbit< debbit spread but the trade-off is that debbit spread but the trade-off is that at< at least you will have a much better at least you will have a much better risk< risk re ratio and somewhere as you can risk re ratio and somewhere as you can see< see as of this current price roughly one see as of this current price roughly one is< is to fall all right guys so let me know is to fall all right guys so let me know in< in the comments below whether you like in the comments below whether you like this< this kind of videos where I go you know this kind of videos where I go you know in-depth< in-depth into examining you know what in-depth into examining you know what kind< kind of option strategies you would kind of option strategies you would trade< trade for the individual stocks so if trade for the individual stocks so if you< you feel that this kind of video is you feel that this kind of video is helpful< helpful let me know in the comments helpful let me know in the comments below< below and maybe also you can let me know below and maybe also you can let me know you< you know what kind of

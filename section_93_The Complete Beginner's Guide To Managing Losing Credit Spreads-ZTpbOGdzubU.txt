===============================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about how to we're going to be talking about how to manage< manage losing trades right more manage losing trades right more specifically< specifically we're going to be talking specifically we're going to be talking about< about how to manage losing credit about how to manage losing credit spreads< spreads all right so here is an example spreads all right so here is an example so< so let's say that you are bullish right so let's say that you are bullish right right< right now on this uh market so let's say right now on this uh market so let's say you< you think that the market is going to go you think that the market is going to go up< up so what better way for you to put on up so what better way for you to put on a< a bullish trade or a neutral to police a bullish trade or a neutral to police trade< trade with the bull put spread right so trade with the bull put spread right so if< if you don't already know the bullpost if you don't already know the bullpost thread< thread is where you sell an out of the thread is where you sell an out of the money< money put option and then you buy a money put option and then you buy a further< further out of the money put option further out of the money put option right< right so at this point of time you've right so at this point of time you've put< put on this uh bull put spread and then put on this uh bull put spread and then the< the market starts to go down so this the market starts to go down so this isn't< isn't an ideal situation for you it's isn't an ideal situation for you it's not< not an ideal scenario for you because not an ideal scenario for you because you< you I really want to see the market you I really want to see the market immediately< immediately go up right so what do you immediately go up right so what do you do< do at this point of time most likely if do at this point of time most likely. if you< you take a look at your trade position you take a look at your trade position it's< it's losing money because the market is it's losing money because the market is coming< coming down so let's take a look at the coming down so let's take a look at the p< p l graph right so the first thing you p l graph right so the first thing you want< want to do is analyze the p l graph to want to do is analyze the p l graph to take< take a look at you know to see whether take a look at you know to see whether is< is there really anything you need to do is there really anything you need to do at< at this point so you can see that your at this point so you can see that your short< short stride is at this point which is 2 short stride is at this point which is 2 8< 8 0 right so at this point down here 8 0 right so at this point down here this< this is where your short strike is and this is where your short strike is and where< where your long strike is for the where your long strike is for the production< production is two seven zero so what you production is two seven zero so what you want< want to take note of is this red line want to take note of is this red line down< down here so this red line is your break down here so this red line is your break even< even point so break-even Point basically even point so break-even Point basically is< is the place whereby past this point is is the place whereby past this point is where< where you will start to lose money at where you will start to lose money at expiration< expiration and then above this point and expiration and then above this point and anywhere< anywhere at expiration you will actually anywhere at expiration you will actually be< be in profits right so let's say for be in profits right so let's say for example< example the market has come down but it example the market has come down but it has< has not yet touched your short stride has not yet touched your short stride right< right at 280. so at this point of time right at 280.

so at this point of time the< the market is actually the market is actually somewhere< somewhere in this region so if it's in somewhere in this region so if it's in this< this region although all right so this this region although all right so this is< is the current market price right now so is the current market price right now so although< although the market has actually dropped although the market has actually dropped and< and you are actually seeing a loss on and you are actually seeing a loss on your< your p l right in your trade position your p l right in your trade position it's< it's actually absolutely fine at this it's actually absolutely fine at this point< point right because remember if you are point right because remember if you are trading< trading credit spreads right in this trading credit spreads right in this case< case the boo put spread this is a case the boo put spread this is a neutral< neutral to a bullish position that means neutral to a bullish position that means to< to say that even though if the market to say that even though if the market does< does go down and as long as it stays does go down and as long as it stays above< above your your break-even point above your your break-even point expiration< expiration you will actually still be in expiration you will actually still be in profit< profit so there are two lines for you to profit so there are two lines for you to take< take a look at here right now so let me take a look at here right now so let me just< just clear this drawing so you can see just clear this drawing so you can see so< so if you see that there is this purple so if you see that there is this purple line line line and< and then you will see that there is this and then you will see that there is this green< green line right so this purple line green line right so this purple line basically< basically is your p l for today right so basically is your p l for today right so this< this purple line down here will this purple line down here will eventually< eventually keep moving right it will eventually keep moving right it will keep< keep moving as the days go by until it keep moving as the days go by until it eventually< eventually becomes this green line down eventually becomes this green line down here< here so this green line down here is here so this green line down here is your< your p l ad expiration so between this your p l ad expiration so between this time< time right from your expiration all the time right from your expiration all the way< way to today every single day there will way to today every single day there will be< be what is called Theta Decay right so be what is called Theta Decay right so this< this is time Decay whereby the option this is time Decay whereby the option prices< prices will slowly start to Decay over prices will slowly start to Decay over time< time and as long as it stays above your time and as long as it stays above your break< break even you're going to make this break even you're going to make this full< full profit so right now even though if full profit so right now even though if the< the market goes all the way down to the market goes all the way down to let's< let's say 285 right 285 you're going to let's say 285 right 285 you're going to see< see like you're having some sort of a see like you're having some sort of a loss< loss right maybe a couple of hundred loss right maybe a couple of hundred dollars< dollars lost but at this point there's dollars lost but at this point there's really< really nothing for you to do there's no really nothing for you to do there's no need< need for you to panic because as long as need for you to panic because as long as it< it stays here all the way until it stays here all the way until expiration< expiration or as days go by you'll see expiration or as days go by you'll see this< this purple line start to move up right this purple line start to move up right it< it will start to move up until it will start to move up until eventually< eventually becomes this green line now eventually becomes this green line now on< on the other hand if you were to take a on the other hand if you were to take a look< look on the other side down here which look on the other side down here which is< is past this point down here this purple is past this point down here this purple line< line down here will start to shift down line down here will start to shift down right< right it will start to go down until it right it will start to go down until it goes< goes to the green line so what does this goes to the green line so what does this mean< mean right so it means that basically as mean right so it means that basically as long< long as right we will use the break-even long as right we will use the break-even point< point so anything above this break-in point so anything above this break-in point< point you really do not have to worry point you really do not have to worry because< because this purple line will in the end because this purple line will in the end start< start going up right so this is the start going up right so this is the effect< effect of time Decay which is the effect of time Decay which is the benefits< benefits of trading a credit spread so benefits of trading a credit spread so at< at this point of time if you were to at this point of time if you were to take< take a look at the charts if you see take a look at the charts if you see that< that the market as long as above your that the market as long as above your break-even< break-even point anywhere above here break-even point anywhere above here then< then there is absolutely nothing to do then there is absolutely nothing to do right< right so if the market is worth the right so if the market is worth the break< break even point do nothing break even point do nothing now< now what if the market starts to go now what if the market starts to go below< below the break-even point so this is below the break-even point so this is where< where you might need to do something where you might need to do something right< right because past the break-even point right because past the break-even point we< we know that this is where we will start we know that this is where we will start to< to lose money if it stays there at to lose money if it stays there at expiration< expiration especially if it goes past expiration especially if it goes past this< this point down here you know that each this point down here you know that each day< day passes it's no longer start to it's day passes it's no longer start to it's no< no longer going to go up right but no longer going to go up right but instead< instead it's going to start to go down instead it's going to start to go down that< that means it starts to lose even more that means it starts to lose even more money< money as each day passes right so what money as each day passes right so what do< do you do so the answer is that it do you do so the answer is that it depends< depends on whether it's past the 21 days depends on whether it's past the 21 days to< to expiration Mark so there are two to expiration Mark so there are two reasons< reasons why we want to use 21 days to reasons why we want to use 21 days to expression< expression it's sort of like a marker expression it's sort of like a marker right< right to decide whether we're going to right to decide whether we're going to do< do anything or not and the first reason do anything or not and the first reason is< is that when you pass the 21 days to is that when you pass the 21 days to expiration< expiration Mark the chances of getting a expiration Mark the chances of getting a sign< sign on your in the money shot put sign on your in the money shot put increases< increases right remember if the market increases right remember if the market starts< starts to go below your shot put strike starts to go below your shot put strike there< there is always chance of an early there is always chance of an early assignment< assignment right early assignment means assignment right early assignment means that< that this uh buyer of the put option that this uh buyer of the put option they< they will start to exercise their option they will start to exercise their option and< and then you will be put a hundred and then you will be put a hundred shares< shares at 280 bucks right so that means shares at 280 bucks right so that means you< you will have to Fork out a capital of you will have to Fork out a capital of 28 28 28 000< 000 to hold on to this position ideally 000 to hold on to this position ideally this< this is something that we do not want this is something that we do not want and< and this is where a lot of people you and this is where a lot of people you know< know when they're first starting out to know when they're first starting out to trade< trade options this is where they kind of trade options this is where they kind of a< a little bit panic because once you see. a little bit panic because once you see their< their short strike being breached one of their short strike being breached one of the< the biggest fear is getting a sign so if the biggest fear is getting a sign so if you< you want to reduce your chances of you want to reduce your chances of getting< getting assigned then you want to see getting assigned then you want to see whether< whether it's past the 21 days your whether it's past the 21 days your expression< expression mark because whether you get expression mark because whether you get assigned< assigned or not on this put option assigned or not on this put option really< really comes down to how much extrinsic really comes down to how much extrinsic value< value left there is in this option right value left there is in this option right so< so the graded extrinsic value the Lesser so the graded extrinsic value the Lesser charge< charge that is to get assigned right charge that is to get assigned right because< because it doesn't really make sense for because it doesn't really make sense for you< you to assign as the put option buyer you to assign as the put option buyer because< because if you were to exercise the because if you were to exercise the option< option then you will be giving up your option then you will be giving up your extrinsic< extrinsic value right that makes no extrinsic value right that makes no sense< sense if you want to profit on this uh sense if you want to profit on this uh put< put option as the put buyer you can just put option as the put buyer you can just simply< simply sell off your put option so when simply sell off your put option so when is< is the time where there is lesser is the time where there is lesser extrinsic< extrinsic value right so the time where extrinsic value right so the time where there's< there's less extrinsic value is when it there's less extrinsic value is when it passes< passes the 21 days to expiration Mark passes the 21 days to expiration Mark where< where it's getting close to expiration where it's getting close to expiration right< right as it goes closer to expiration right as it goes closer to expiration the< the Theta Decay starts to become even the Theta Decay starts to become even higher< higher so that's when you start to higher so that's when you start to rapidly< rapidly Decay whatever value there is in rapidly Decay whatever value there is in the< the option so this is where the chances the option so this is where the chances of< of you getting assigned on your in the of you getting assigned on your in the money< money shot put gets higher now the money shot put gets higher now the second< second reason why you want to take a second reason why you want to take a look< look at 21 days to expression is because look at 21 days to expression is because there's< there's already been studies done the there's already been studies done the research< research done by the tasty trade team research done by the tasty trade team that< that if you were to manage your trade that if you were to manage your trade it's< it's right if you want to take off your it's right if you want to take off your trades< trades at the 21 days expiration Mark trades at the 21 days expiration Mark you< you actually see that you reduce your you actually see that you reduce your average< average loss significantly right so you average loss significantly right so you can< can see that based on a five dollar and can see that based on a five dollar and ten< ten dollar white put spread right if you ten dollar white put spread right if you hold< hold to expiration you can see that it's hold to expiration you can see that it's a< a few hundred dollars right but if you a few hundred dollars right but if you were< were to manage it at 21 days right you were to manage it at 21 days right you close< close your trade out early your loss has close your trade out early your loss has been< been reduced dramatically at the same been reduced dramatically at the same time< time you have higher return compared if time you have higher return compared if you< you were to hold it all the way to you were to hold it all the way to expression< expression so these are the two reasons expression so these are the two reasons why< why you want to use 21 days as a marker why you want to use 21 days as a marker So< So based on these 21 days to expiration So based on these 21 days to expiration this< this is where we are going to have an this is where we are going to have an idea< idea of whether we're going to do idea of whether we're going to do anything< anything or not so with this in mind anything or not so with this in mind if< if the market is below the break-even if the market is below the break-even point< point and it's still above 21 days to point and it's still above 21 days to expiration< expiration guess what you do nothing expiration guess what you do nothing because< because there is still time for the because there is still time for the market< market to eventually rebound right so market to eventually rebound right so the< the beauty about the credit spread is the beauty about the credit spread is that< that you actually already sort of have that you actually already sort of have your< your maximum loss in place right because your maximum loss in place right because you< you have already bought this put option you have already bought this put option down< down here so you do not really actually down here so you do not really actually have< have to worry because you already have have to worry because you already have defined< defined your risk you already know defined your risk you already know what's< what's the maximum loss that you could what's the maximum loss that you could lose< lose so the market can go all the way to lose so the market can go all the way to zero< zero for our cash it doesn't have to zero for our cash it doesn't have to bother< bother you because you already have your bother you because you already have your maximum< maximum loss in place which is at the maximum loss in place which is at the 270< 270 put Mark right so you cannot lose 270 put Mark right so you cannot lose anything< anything more than the width of this put anything more than the width of this put spread< spread minus the credit of course so spread minus the credit of course so when< when there's still above 21 days to go when there's still above 21 days to go there's< there's always chance for the market to there's always chance for the market to come< come back right you let Theta Decay work come back right you let Theta Decay work in< in your favor you continue to hold on to in your favor you continue to hold on to this< this trade even though it can go all the this trade even though it can go all the way< way down it can eventually come back up way down it can eventually come back up and< and because there is still a lot of days and because there is still a lot of days left< left to expiration the chances of you left to expiration the chances of you getting< getting a sign is very very low now what getting a sign is very very low now what if< if there's less than 21 days to if there's less than 21 days to expiration< expiration so there are two things that expiration so there are two things that you< you can do well the first of which is to you can do well the first of which is to simply< simply just take a loss simply just take a loss so< so if you were to take a look at the p l so if you were to take a look at the p l graph< graph down here so anything that is graph down here so anything that is below< below the breakdown point expiration we below the breakdown point expiration we already< already know we're going to lose money already know we're going to lose money but< but if it's below this point down here but if it's below this point down here if< if you can see this point down here the if you can see this point down here the longer< longer that you hold it each day that longer that you hold it each day that passes< passes this purple line will start to passes this purple line will start to accelerate< accelerate to this green line down here accelerate to this green line down here right< right this is where it will be at right this is where it will be at expiration< expiration so each day as you hold expiration so each day as you hold you're< you're going to start to lose even more you're going to start to lose even more and< and more so that is why for me generally and more so that is why for me generally as< as long as it's past the 21 days to as long as it's past the 21 days to expression< expression Mark and it's below my break expression Mark and it's below my break even< even point I generally just take a loss even point I generally just take a loss you< you know I have many different trades on you know I have many different trades on so< so I do not want to try and Salvage so I do not want to try and Salvage every< every single trade right just remember every single trade right just remember when< when you put on this trade there's when you put on this trade there's already< already a 78. 43 right around 70 plus already a 78.

43 right around 70 plus percent< percent if you're going around the 25 percent if you're going around the 25 Delta< Delta Buck right if you were to put on Delta Buck right if you were to put on this< this trade so there is always a chance this trade so there is always a chance that< that you can lose so there's no need to that you can lose so there's no need to always< always Salvage every single trade so if always Salvage every single trade so if this< this trade is a loser you can always put this trade is a loser you can always put on< on another one so you might be saying on another one so you might be saying you< you know I do want to try and hold it you know I do want to try and hold it because< because if you hold it you might go back because if you hold it you might go back past< past to this point and then at this past to this point and then at this point< point on right you will start to make point on right you will start to make more< more money as each day passes now more money as each day passes now definitely< definitely this is an option that you definitely this is an option that you can< can do but what if it further goes down can do but what if it further goes down right< right then if it goes further down then right then if it goes further down then it's< it's going to be much more difficult for it's going to be much more difficult for you< you to eventually recoup back the losses you to eventually recoup back the losses because< because it has to move a greater because it has to move a greater distance< distance back up right so at the same distance back up right so at the same time< time when you're past the 21 days to time when you're past the 21 days to expiration< expiration Mark don't forget you are now expiration Mark don't forget you are now below< below your short strike so as it goes below your short strike so as it goes closer< closer and closer to the expiration time closer and. closer to the expiration time all< all right the expiration date your all right the expiration date your extrinsic< extrinsic value will get lesser and it extrinsic value will get lesser and it gets< gets even lesser as the market moves gets even lesser as the market moves further< further deeper in the money right as it further deeper in the money right as it goes< goes all the way down it goes deeper in goes all the way down it goes deeper in the< the money that's where your extrinsic the money that's where your extrinsic value< value will start to shrink as well on value will start to shrink as well on top< top of that your extrinsic value is top of that your extrinsic value is already< already starting to lose even more already starting to lose even more because< because of fatal Decay and that's where because of fatal Decay and that's where you're< you're going to start to have a very you're going to start to have a very high< high chance of getting assigned and then high chance of getting assigned and then you'll< you'll be put the 100 shares which I'm you'll be put the 100 shares which I'm pretty< pretty sure that is not a situation pretty sure that is not a situation which< which you want to get into by the way if which you want to get into by the way if you< you like this video so far Please you like this video so far Please Subscribe< Subscribe and also click the thumbs up Subscribe and also click the thumbs up button< button and also do get your free copy of button and also do get your free copy of the< the options income blueprint where I the options income blueprint where I share< share the top three options strategies share the top three options strategies that< that help you generate a consistent that help you generate a consistent income< income each month trading just one to income each month trading just one to two< two hours a day right so if you want to two hours a day right so if you want to go< go ahead to get this copy just head on go ahead to get this copy just head on over< over to optionswithdavis. com blueprint over to optionswithdavis.

com blueprint or< or right back to the video so that's the or right back to the video so that's the first< first thing that you can do which is first thing that you can do which is simply< simply just to take a loss now the other simply just to take a loss now the other thing< thing is that if you don't want to take thing is that if you don't want to take a< a loss and you still have a bullish view a loss and you still have a bullish view right< right you still think the market can right you still think the market can possibly< possibly rebound then you can roll it possibly rebound then you can roll it right< right you can roll it if you can get a right you can roll it if you can get a credit< credit now rolling credit spreads is credit now rolling credit spreads is very< very different from Rolling just a naked very different from Rolling just a naked shot< shot option let's say for example a shot option let's say for example a naked< naked shot put if a role is short put naked shot put if a role is short put chances< chances are that you can always roll for chances are that you can always roll for a< a credit but when it comes to a credit a credit but when it comes to a credit spread< spread it is not always that you can get spread it is not always that you can get a< a credit right it really depends on a credit right it really depends on whether< whether the price is closer to the shot whether the price is closer to the shot put< put strike or the long put strike if put strike or the long put strike if it's< it's closer to the shot put strike then it's closer to the shot put strike then yes< yes you can most likely roll for a yes you can most likely roll for a credit< credit but if it's closer to the long credit but if it's closer to the long put< put strike then chances are that it will put strike then chances are that it will be< be a debit then at that point of time be a debit then at that point of time then< then it wouldn't really make sense to then it wouldn't really make sense to roll< roll your credit spread so the process roll your credit spread so the process of< of rolling a credit spread is actually of rolling a credit spread is actually pretty< pretty simple what it's actually doing pretty simple what it's actually doing is< is that you are closing out your this is that you are closing out your this shot< shot put spread and then you are selling shot put spread and then you are selling another< another put spread right so in in actual another put spread right so in in actual fact< fact what you're doing is that you are fact what you're doing is that you are closing< closing out your current put spread for closing out your current put spread for a< a loss and then you are selling another a loss and then you are selling another put< put spread with a credit that is more put spread with a credit that is more than< than the loss so this way you can than the loss so this way you can overall< overall credit so maybe when you close overall credit so maybe when you close out< out this put spread maybe you have to out this put spread maybe you have to pay< pay out five dollars for this and then pay out five dollars for this and then when< when you sell the put spread again at a when you sell the put spread again at a later< later expiration date so maybe let's say later expiration date so maybe let's say there's< there's 21 want this to expiration left there's 21 want this to expiration left so< so what you want to do is you want to so what you want to do is you want to roll< roll to a NYX the closest expiration roll to a NYX the closest expiration date< date that is around 45 days to somewhere date that is around 45 days to somewhere around< around 60 days to expiration date and around 60 days to expiration date and then< then you will be selling this uh put then you will be selling this uh put spread< spread maybe for five dollars and say 50 spread maybe for five dollars and say 50 cents< cents right maybe five dollars and fifty cents right maybe five dollars and fifty cents< cents so this way you get a credit of 50 cents so this way you get a credit of 50 cents< cents so when you're doing this role cents so when you're doing this role what< what you're essentially also doing is what you're essentially also doing is lowering< lowering the maximum loss on this spread lowering the maximum loss on this spread right< right so maybe your maximum loss for right so maybe your maximum loss for this< this spread could be maybe say eight this spread could be maybe say eight dollars< dollars but now that you receive 50 dollars but now that you receive 50 cents< cents for this credit which means to say cents for this credit which means to say your< your maximum loss could now be just your maximum loss could now be just around< around seven dollars fifty cents and if around seven dollars fifty cents and if you< you just keep rolling this each time you just keep rolling this each time whenever< whenever you get a credit you're just whenever you get a credit you're just slowly< slowly slowly reducing the maximum loss slowly slowly reducing the maximum loss until< until eventually the markets comes back until eventually the markets comes back up< up so this is something that you can do up so this is something that you can do if< if you want to roll your credit spread if you want to roll your credit spread rather< rather than just take a loss now the rather than just take a loss now the other< other question you might have is you other question you might have is you know< know there's a what what if the market know there's a what what if the market actually< actually comes down but it's still above actually comes down but it's still above the< the put strike right and at 21 days it's the put strike right and at 21 days it's still< still above the put strike but then I'm still above the put strike but then I'm still< still at a loss right if you were to still at a loss right if you were to look< look at your trade position you will see look at your trade position you will see that< that this could be a law so what do you that this could be a law so what do you do< do do you actually take out for a loss do do you actually take out for a loss so< so for this it really comes to you right so for this it really comes to you right remember< remember if you were to take a look at remember if you were to take a look at the< the p l graph anything that is above the the p l graph anything that is above the break-even< break-even point we are still in the break-even point we are still in the profit< profit right technically we are seeing a profit right technically we are seeing a profit< profit Above This breakdown Point as profit Above This breakdown Point as long< long as it stays there by expiration long as it stays there by expiration point< point so if it's above this point let's point so if it's above this point let's say< say from the market is down here you may say from the market is down here you may see< see that you're still in a loss right see that you're still in a loss right you< you may still see that you're currently you may still see that you're currently in< in a loss but then it's not necessarily in a loss but then it's not necessarily a< a loss if it stays there all the way to a loss if it stays there all the way to expression< expression so at this point you can expression so at this point you can either< either just choose to hold on to this either just choose to hold on to this position< position all the way to the expiration position all the way to the expiration date< date or at this point you can just roll date or at this point you can just roll it< it right you could just roll it and get it right you could just roll it and get even< even more credit right there's a chance even more credit right there's a chance that< that if you roll it when it's above the that if you roll it when it's above the strike< strike you can get quite a bit of credit strike you can get quite a bit of credit so< so this way you are prolonging the trade so this way you are prolonging the trade at< at the same time you give it chance for at the same time you give it chance for the< the market to eventually go back up and the market to eventually go back up and then< then you could profit on this position then you could profit on this position as< as well so it really comes down to you as well so it really comes down to you at< at this point okay so this is for the at this point okay so this is for the put< put spread now what about for the call put spread now what about for the call spread< spread well the call spread is pretty spread well the call spread is pretty much< much just the opposite right so if you much just the opposite right so if you are< are bearish let's say you're bearish on are bearish let's say you're bearish on the< the trade you put on a call spread so if the trade you put on a call spread so if the< the market is below the break-even the market is below the break-even basically< basically you do nothing right similarly basically you do nothing right similarly so< so the break event will be above this so the break event will be above this time< time and if the market is above the time and if the market is above the break-even< break-even right in this case then again break-even right in this case then again we< we take a look at the 21 days to we take a look at the 21 days to expiration< expiration point so if it's more than 21 expiration point so if it's more than 21 days< days to expiration you do nothing and if days to expiration you do nothing and if it's< it's less than 21 days of expiration it's less than 21 days of expiration well< well you either take a loss or roll if well you either take a loss or roll if you< you can get a credit simple as that now you can get a credit simple as that now you< you might be asking but Davis what about you might be asking but Davis what about turning< turning it into another trade right turning it into another trade right something< something more advanced more complex so something more advanced more complex so for< for example you might turn the shot put for example you might turn the shot put spread< spread into a short put right so for spread into a short put right so for example< example you have the shot put spread example you have the shot put spread down< down here all right so you have the shot down here all right so you have the shot put< put and then you have the long put so put and then you have the long put so some< some people what they do is that when some people what they do is that when the< the market actually goes down right they the market actually goes down right they see< see these two as a separate trade now see these two as a separate trade now they< they split them up because you will be they split them up because you will be losing< losing money on this shot put position losing money on this shot put position but< but you'll actually be making money on but you'll actually be making money on this< this long per position so what they do this long per position so what they do is< is that they sell off this long put is that they sell off this long put position< position so they make money on this long position so they make money on this long put< put and then for this shot put what they put and then for this shot put what they do< do is that they roll it down right they do is that they roll it down right they roll< roll it down so by rolling down what you roll it down so by rolling down what you do< do is you get additional credit as well do is you get additional credit as well and< and at the same time you reduce the and at the same time you reduce the break-even< break-even point of your new trade right break-even point of your new trade right now< now which is a shot put and then you now which is a shot put and then you give< give some time for the market to rebound give some time for the market to rebound right< right if you're still bullish on this right if you're still bullish on this trade< trade so should you actually do this or trade so should you actually do this or not< not so my take is that I generally like not so my take is that I generally like to< to just enter the trade and exit the to just enter the trade and exit the trade< trade as the original trade right if I trade as the original trade right if I entered< entered it as a put spread I want to entered it as a put spread I want to exit< exit it as a put spread if I enter it as exit it as a put spread if I enter it as a< a call spread right a bad call spread a call spread right a bad call spread then< then I want to exit it as a bear call then I want to exit it as a bear call spread< spread because the reason is that when spread because the reason is that when you< you turn it into the shot put you have you turn it into the shot put you have totally< totally changed your risk profile so totally changed your risk profile so let's< let's say for example if you receive say let's say for example if you receive say two< two dollars for this credit spread right two dollars for this credit spread right and< and then the width is ten dollars so the and then the width is ten dollars so the maximum< maximum loss is pretty much basically maximum loss is pretty much basically the< the width minus of the credit right the width minus of the credit right which< which is two dollars so your maximum which is two dollars so your maximum loss< loss will be eight dollars right eight loss will be eight dollars right eight dollars< dollars would be your maximum risk which dollars would be your maximum risk which is< is 800 per credit spread that you put on is 800 per credit spread that you put on per< per put spread that you put on now once per put spread that you put on now once you< you have changed this into a shot put you have changed this into a shot put you< you have totally changed the dynamic of you have totally changed the dynamic of this< this trade because now no longer is your this trade because now no longer is your maximum< maximum risk 800 your maximum risk is maximum risk 800 your maximum risk is all< all the way to zero because at this all the way to zero because at this point< point of time remember you have turned point of time remember you have turned it< it into a shot put so let's say you have it into a shot put so let's say you have rolled< rolled the shot put down from 280 to 270 rolled the shot put down from 280 to 270 so< so 270 is now your shot put ad right so so 270 is now your shot put ad right so now< now you no longer have any protection now you no longer have any protection below< below you have no protection below that below you have no protection below that in< in the event whereby the market crash in the event whereby the market crash then< then you can lose much more than this then you can lose much more than this 800< 800 which you initially had it on right 800 which you initially had it on. right the< the initial risk when you put it on so the initial risk when you put it on so that< that is why I do not really like to put that is why I do not really like to put it< it on can it work definitely can work if it on can it work definitely can work if you< you are right on the trade if it goes up you are right on the trade if it goes up but< but if it goes down then you're going to but if it goes down then you're going to lose< lose much more than what you initially lose much more than what you initially allocated< allocated to the trade in the first allocated to the trade in the first place< place right so that's my take on convert place right so that's my take on convert it< it to a shot put now what about turning it to a shot put now what about turning it< it into a butterfly or an iron Condor so it into a butterfly or an iron Condor so by< by turning into the butterfly iron by turning into the butterfly iron Condor< Condor so it's slightly different from Condor so it's slightly different from shot< shot put because with the shot put you shot put because with the shot put you have< have turned a a defined risk kind of have turned a a defined risk kind of trade< trade into an undefined risk but by trade into an undefined risk but by turning< turning into the butterfly iron Condor turning into the butterfly iron Condor what< what you're doing is that you're still what you're doing is that you're still sticking< sticking to a defined risk strategy sticking to a defined risk strategy right< right you're changing it to a defined right you're changing it to a defined risk< risk strategy still where there's a risk strategy still where there's a maximum< maximum loss but then now you've changed maximum loss but then now you've changed a< a little bit of the dynamic so in this a little bit of the dynamic so in this case< case maybe for example if the market case maybe for example if the market goes< goes up then you say hey I want to goes up then you say hey I want to change< change it to an iron Condor so you sell change it to an iron Condor so you sell a< a put option here and then you buy a put a put option here and then you buy a put option< option here so -1 and then plus one so option here so -1 and then plus one so down< down here you have an iron Condor so down here you have an iron Condor so first< first of all when you do it this way first of all when you do it this way when< when you sell a put spread you will when you sell a put spread you will receive< receive a credit as well so this way you receive a credit as well so this way you actually< actually reduce your maximum loss right actually reduce your maximum loss right so< so if previously your maximum loss was so if previously your maximum loss was 800< 800 let's say your previous uh 800 let's say your previous uh trade< trade right your call spread let's say trade right your call spread let's say you< you put on this call spread down here you put on this call spread down here the< the maximum loss is 800 Now by putting the maximum loss is 800 Now by putting on< on this brand let's say you receive a on this brand let's say you receive a dollar< dollar in terms of credit right so a dollar in terms of credit right so a dollar< dollar would basically be 100 so you dollar would basically be 100 so you will< will minus off a hundred dollars from will minus off a hundred dollars from your< your maximum loss so now you have turned your maximum loss so now you have turned this< this trade into a maximum 700 loss this trade into a maximum 700 loss because< because you have received credit for because you have received credit for this< this and the market can only be at one this and the market can only be at one side< side an expiration right so this two has side an expiration right so this two has to< to be the same expiration date by the to be the same expiration date by the way you< way you want to keep it at the same way you want to keep it at the same expiration< expiration date so there's no messing expiration date so there's no messing around< around with the different kind of around with the different kind of duration< duration and timings right so when you duration and timings right so when you do< do it this way you reduce your maximum do it this way you reduce your maximum loss< loss but the problem with this strategy loss but the problem with this strategy is< is that you actually also have reduced is that you actually also have reduced your< your probability of profit right when your probability of profit right when before< before when you put on this this trade before when you put on this this trade your< your property or profit should be maybe your property or profit should be maybe around< around 70 odd percent right let's say 75 around 70 odd percent right let's say 75 if< if you put on roughly around a 25 Delta if you put on roughly around a 25 Delta for< for the short strike so your probably for the short strike so your probably your< your profit will be around 7 five your profit will be around 7 five percent< percent but because you have put on this percent but because you have put on this put< put spread suddenly you have totally put spread suddenly you have totally changed< changed the dynamic of this trade and changed the dynamic of this trade and then< then now the probability of profit is then now the probability of profit is going< going to drop it's definitely going to going to drop it's definitely going to drop< drop and it's probably less than 50 drop and it's probably less than 50 because< because now you have really tightened up because now you have really tightened up this< this space where it can be in profit and this space where it can be in profit and in< in the case where the market goes down in the case where the market goes down it< it doesn't really have that much room it doesn't really have that much room right< right now right it doesn't have that right now right it doesn't have that much< much room for you to be in profit and much room for you to be in profit and you< you probably have to hold on to the you probably have to hold on to the street< street for a longer time because now you street for a longer time because now you have< have the friction of the shot put spread have the friction of the shot put spread because< because even though you're making money because even though you're making money on< on the call spread as the market comes on the call spread as the market comes down< down you are losing money on the shot down you are losing money on the shot put< put spread so that is why I don't really put spread so that is why I don't really like< like the idea of turning into a like the idea of turning into a butterfly< butterfly or iron Condor because once butterfly or iron Condor because once you< you do it you're pretty much like you you do it you're pretty much like you know< know you're throwing in the towel right know you're throwing in the towel right you're< you're pretty much saying that you know you're pretty much saying that you know I< I don't think I can really win I just I don't think I can really win I just don't< don't want to lose that much because if don't want to lose that much because if you< you think about it if you were to place you think about it if you were to place this< this iron Condor at the start you're this iron Condor at the start you're able< able to get it at a much wider length able to get it at a much wider length right< right you will get a much much wider right you will get a much much wider profit< profit zone so let's say for example you profit zone so let's say for example you have< have the 280 and the 270 put spread so have the 280 and the 270 put spread so this< this makes the iron Condor so the iron this makes the iron Condor so the iron Condor< Condor previously you may also let's say Condor previously you may also let's say for< for example you get a dollar or maybe for example you get a dollar or maybe two< two dollars for this and then you get it two dollars for this and then you get it at< at a much lower strike Price Right at a much lower strike Price Right making< making your iron Condor profit Zone much making your iron Condor profit Zone much wider< wider but because the market has gone up wider but because the market has gone up and< and then you sell the put spread above and then you sell the put spread above what< what you have done is you actually what you have done is you actually gotten< gotten the same credit but now you got gotten the same credit but now you got it< it at a higher strike price so in a it at a higher strike price so in a sense< sense I feel this is a little bit of a a sense I feel this is a little bit of a a disadvantage< disadvantage because you could have disadvantage because you could have gotten< gotten a wider profit Zone whereby if gotten a wider profit Zone whereby if the< the market did come down with the the market did come down with the original< original iron condo if you put it on original iron condo if you put it on this< this way you would have been in the this way you would have been in the profit< profit but right now you have to settle profit but right now you have to settle for< for a smaller loss so this is my take on for a smaller loss so this is my take on turning< turning into a butterfly and iron Condor turning into a butterfly and iron Condor so< so I don't really do this too but I know so I don't really do this too but I know some< some people do and whether you want to some people do and whether you want to do< do it or not really comes down to your do it or not really comes down to your own< own description question but I do think own description question but I do think that< that it is much better if you just left that it is much better if you just left it< it as the original trade and then just it as the original trade and then just either< either roll it by itself if you can get either roll it by itself if you can get a< a credit or just cut loss and then just a credit or just cut loss and then just wait< wait for another opportunity again right wait for another opportunity again right so< so remember there's no need for you to so remember there's no need for you to win< win every single trade right the win every single trade right the probability< probability of profit is already there probability of profit is already there you< you have a 75 probability of profit you have a 75 probability of profit let's< let's say you put on this trade for 75 let's say you put on this trade for 75 probability< probability a profit then guess what you probability a profit then guess what you will< will win 75 percent of the time and that will win 75 percent of the time and that also< also means that you have a chance to also means that you have a chance to lose< lose 25 of the time right so you will lose 25 of the time right so you will have< have winners and losers you cannot have winners and losers you cannot always< always try and get a winner out of every always try and get a winner out of every single< single trade right the best thing for single trade right the best thing for you< you to do is just keep on putting the you to do is just keep on putting the trades< trades so over time the probability will trades so over time the probability will play< play out just like if you were to flip a play out just like if you were to flip a coin< coin if you were to flip a coin say just coin if you were to flip a coin say just five< five times it's easy for you to get four five times it's easy for you to get four hits< hits and just one tail right it's very hits and just one tail right it's very very< very possible so let's say each time I very possible so let's say each time I hit< hit it's a lot so you could get four hit it's a lot so you could get four losses< losses and then one win just but just by losses and then one win just but just by flipping< flipping the coins five times but if you flipping the coins five times but if you were< were to flip the coin 500 times a were to flip the coin 500 times a thousand< thousand times then guess what it's most thousand times then guess what it's most likely< likely going to be around 50 50 so it's likely going to be around 50 50 so it's the< the same for your trading right the the same for your trading right the beautiful< beautiful options is that you already beautiful options is that you already know< know your probability up front you have know your probability up front you have the< the rough estimate of will win rate the rough estimate of will win rate upfront< upfront already when you put on the upfront already when you put on the trades< trades so all you have to do is just let trades so all you have to do is just let the< the property play out as you put on more the property play out as you put on more trades< trades so what really matters is to trades so what really matters is to position< position size your trades properly position size your trades properly according< according to your Capital allocation and according to your Capital allocation and manage< manage your risk well that means to say manage your risk well that means to say you< you do not put such a big position on you do not put such a big position on for< for your trading account size right so for your trading account size right so if< if for example your trading account size if for example your trading account size say< say it's ten thousand dollars then you say it's ten thousand dollars then you do< do not want to reach more than 500 to do not want to reach more than 500 to 700< 700 per trade right if you want to put 700 per trade right if you want to put on< on one credit spread and it's going to on one credit spread and it's going to receive< receive five thousand dollars then that receive five thousand dollars then that is< is way too big so that is where you'll is way too big so that is where you'll start< start depending as the as the trade goes start depending as the as the trade goes against< against you so remember keep your size against you so remember keep your size small< small and then just let the probability small and then just let the probability play< play out in the end alright guys so I play out in the end alright guys so I hope< hope this video has been helpful for you hope this video has been helpful for you and< and it gives you a little insight on how and it gives you a little insight on how you< you can

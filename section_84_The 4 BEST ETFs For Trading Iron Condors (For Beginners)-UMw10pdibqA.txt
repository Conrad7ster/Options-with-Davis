========================================================================

Language: en all< all right all righty so in today's video all right all righty so in today's video we< we are going to be talking about the we are going to be talking about the four< four best index ETFs for trading ion four best index ETFs for trading ion condos< condos right so this is suitable for you condos right so this is suitable for you if< if you're just starting out in trading if you're just starting out in trading options< options or if you have never traded I in options or if you have never traded I in Condors< Condors before and you want to get Condors before and you want to get started< started in trading I condos then you can started in trading I condos then you can definitely< definitely use this four index ETFs I'm definitely use this four index ETFs I'm about< about to share with you now before we about to share with you now before we actually< actually get into the index ETFs that actually get into the index ETFs that you< you can trate the very first thing I you can trate the very first thing I want< want to share with you is why we want want to share with you is why we want actually< actually choose index ETF instead of actually choose index ETF instead of individual< individual stocks when we're trading the individual stocks when we're trading the iron< iron Condor and this is uh pretty iron Condor and this is uh pretty important< important right so I'm going to share important right so I'm going to share with< with you a number of reasons why and the with you a number of reasons why and the very< very first reason is that index ETFs very first reason is that index ETFs tend< tend to be less volatile than individual tend to be less volatile than individual stocks< stocks and this is a very very important stocks and this is a very very important uh< uh difference between index ETFs and uh difference between index ETFs and stocks< stocks because for iron Condors what we stocks because for iron Condors what we want< want is for the underlying to actually want is for the underlying to actually stay< stay within our profit zone right so so stay within our profit zone right so so if< if we have an iron Condor we have a call if we have an iron Condor we have a call spread< spread at the top all right if you're spread at the top all right if you're not< not very familiar with what the iron not very familiar with what the iron Condor< Condor is it's basically just a bare Condor is it's basically just a bare call< call spread plus a bull put spread right call spread plus a bull put spread right so< so at the bottom down here you have your so at the bottom down here you have your put< put spread right some people call it the put spread right some people call it the put< put credit spread and then at the top put credit spread and then at the top you< you have your call Credit spread right you have your call Credit spread right so< so when this two combine you actually so when this two combine you actually have< have the iron Condor so your profit zone have the iron Condor so your profit zone is< is somewhere in the middle right so if is somewhere in the middle right so if you< you want to be profitable in this trade you want to be profitable in this trade or< or for putting on the iron condol then or for putting on the iron condol then you< you want the price to actually stay you want the price to actually stay within< within this profit Zone down here right within this profit Zone down here right so< so this is the profit zone so as much as so this is the profit zone so as much as possible< possible when we're choosing an possible when we're choosing an underlying< underlying we do not want the underlying underlying we do not want the underlying to< to move too much right we don't want it to move too much right we don't want it to< to move far to you know to test either to move far to you know to test either our< our call spread or to our put site as our call spread or to our put site as much< much as possible so in this case you can much as possible so in this case you can see< see in this graph down here this is a see in this graph down here this is a study< study done by the tasty trade team right study done by. the tasty trade team right they< they compare the ETS versus the stocks they compare the ETS versus the stocks in< in terms of their movement right so as in terms of their movement right so as you< you can see in the one shaded in blue you can see in the one shaded in blue you< you can see that the index ETF right the you can see that the index ETF right the movement< movement is actually much more muted movement is actually much more muted right< right it stays more within the Zone right it stays more within the Zone compared< compared to individual stocks right as compared to individual stocks right as you< you can see stocks down here you see the you can see stocks down here you see the standard< standard deviation move is actually much standard deviation move is actually much bigger< bigger right so let me just put the word bigger right so let me just put the word stocks< stocks down here and up there is ETF so stocks down here and up there is ETF so if< if you were to compare this two which do if you were to compare this two which do you< you think is much more suitable for us you think is much more suitable for us to< to use when we are trading the iron to use when we are trading the iron condol< condol where we want the underlying to condol where we want the underlying to actually< actually stay in within you know the actually stay in within you know the Zone< Zone doesn't move that much well then Zone doesn't move that much well then obviously< obviously it's going to be the ETFs obviously it's going to be the ETFs right< right so that is the first and one of right so that is the first and one of the< the most important reason why when we the most important reason why when we are< are choosing you know underlying to are choosing you know underlying to trade< trade for iron Condors we prefer to go trade for iron Condors we prefer to go for< for index ETFs than individual stocks for index ETFs than individual stocks now< now the next reason why you want to now the next reason why you want to choose< choose index ETFs is because index ETFs choose index ETFs is because index ETFs aren't< aren't as sensitive to earnings compared aren't as sensitive to earnings compared to< to individual stocks right so as you can to individual stocks right so as you can see< see down here this is of Apple let me see down here this is of Apple let me just< just give you an example of Apple so just give you an example of Apple so apple< apple on this day as you can see it has apple on this day as you can see it has GED< GED down pretty considerably right so GED down pretty considerably right so this< this is when it released its earnings so this is when it released its earnings so a< a lot of time when the earnings come out a lot of time when the earnings come out the< the stock can Gap up or down pretty the stock can Gap up or down pretty strongly< strongly right so if you were to trade strongly right so if you were to trade the< the Inon Condor here this is definitely the Inon Condor here this is definitely not< not an ideal situation for you now let's not an ideal situation for you now let's compare< compare to the index ETF right so this compare to the index ETF right so this index< index ETF is the xlk so xlk is the index ETF is the xlk so xlk is the spiders< spiders technology sector index ETF and spiders technology sector index ETF and what< what you'll notice is that the uh what you'll notice is that the uh movement< movement on the very same day is movement on the very same day is actually< actually so much different compared to actually so much different compared to Apple< Apple stock now you might wondering what Apple stock now you might wondering what is< is xlk right so xlk actually holds a is xlk right so xlk actually holds a number< number of tech stocks and one of the number of tech stocks and one of the biggest< biggest Holdings is actually Apple so as biggest Holdings is actually Apple so as you< you can see down here this shows the top you can see down here this shows the top 10< 10 Holdings of xlk right this index ETF 10 Holdings of xlk right this index ETF and< and apple is at number two right at and apple is at number two right at 21. 84%< 21.

84% so this is a pretty significant 21. 84% so this is a pretty significant you< you know a percentage of this whole ETF you know a percentage of this whole ETF because< because it's like the top two and you because it's like the top two and you can< can see everything else below that is can see everything else below that is about< about 5% and odd right so even though about 5% and odd right so even though this< this actually holds you know quite a big this actually holds you know quite a big percentage< percentage of this uh index ETF the percentage of this uh index ETF the movement< movement is actually not that big right movement is actually not that big right you< you can see that Apple gaps down but you can see that Apple gaps down but then< then for xlk the movement seems as then for xlk the movement seems as though< though it's like any other ordinary day though it's like any other ordinary day so< so that is one of the reasons why we so that is one of the reasons why we also< also want to choose index ETS because we also want to choose index ETS because we are< are not really bothered by earnings so are not really bothered by earnings so if< if you have an iron condom on Apple you if you have an iron condom on Apple you have< have to be worried about the earnings have to be worried about the earnings release< release date but whereas when you trade release date but whereas when you trade the< the index ETF you don't have to bother the index ETF you don't have to bother right< right if you see a setup that you know right if you see a setup that you know you< you think it's good for the iron condo you think it's good for the iron condo you< you can just put it on right so this is you can just put it on right so this is the< the second reason why we're choosing the second reason why we're choosing index< index ETFs as opposed to individual index ETFs as opposed to individual stocks< stocks now the third reason is that stocks now the third reason is that index< index ETFs actually have a wider index ETFs actually have a wider selection< selection of strikes right so if you selection of strikes right so if you were< were to compare individual stocks so for were to compare individual stocks so for example< example for this I use the example of example for this I use the example of CRM< CRM because I had a subscriber they CRM because I had a subscriber they actually< actually told me that they had an iron actually told me that they had an iron Condor< Condor on CRM and it has already went Condor on CRM and it has already went way< way past you know one of their uh short way past you know one of their uh short strikes< strikes right it went so far way past strikes right it went so far way past that< that they are probably at the max loss that they are probably at the max loss right< right now so if you were to take a look right now so if you were to take a look at< at this uh option chain down here what at this uh option chain down here what you< you will notice is that first thing you will notice is that first thing there's< there's only five point wide strike there's only five point wide strike differences< differences right if you were to take a differences right if you were to take a look< look at the atani strikes there's two look at the atani strikes there's two five< five Z and the next one is 255 on the five Z and the next one is 255 on the top< top and the one at bottom is 245 so top and the one at bottom is 245 so that's< that's 5 point wide on top of that if that's 5 point wide on top of that if you< you take a look at the Delta you notice you take a look at the Delta you notice that< that the Delta is not that near to each that the Delta is not that near to each other< other it's quite far apart right you other it's quite far apart right you have< have a 15 Delta the next one is 20 Delta have a 15 Delta the next one is 20 Delta then< then 27 Delta so there about like 5 to then 27 Delta so there about like 5 to seven< seven Deltas apart right on the call seven Deltas apart right on the call side< side it's even more dramatic right you side it's even more dramatic right you can< can see that there's a 10 point can see that there's a 10 point difference< difference from 255 to 260 and then difference from 255 to 260 and then eight< eight points different or rather eight eight points different or rather eight Delta< Delta difference from 260 to 265 so why Delta difference from 260 to 265 so why does< does this pose a problem well this pose does this pose a problem well this pose a< a problem because when we constructing a problem because when we constructing the< the iron condol Delta actually plays a the iron condol Delta actually plays a very< very big part in our construction right very big part in our construction right so< so most of the time let's say for so most of the time let's say for example< example if you're going for a neutral example if you're going for a neutral iron< iron condol you want to go somewhere iron condol you want to go somewhere within< within around 16 to 20 Deltas when within around 16 to 20 Deltas when you're< you're uh constructing the short strike you're uh constructing the short strike so< so let's say on the put side you want to so let's say on the put side you want to find< find something maybe like 18 Deltas but find something maybe like 18 Deltas but you< you can't find one right you have to go you can't find one right you have to go for< for either 15 Deltas or 20 Deltas but for either 15 Deltas or 20 Deltas but what< what about on the call side right if you what about on the call side right if you take< take a look at the call side down here take a look at the call side down here if< if you want to go for something like 18 if you want to go for something like 18 or< or 20 Deltas you can't right you have to or 20 Deltas you can't right you have to jump< jump to either 16 delt Del or 23 Delta jump to either 16 delt Del or 23 Delta and< and what they will affect is actually and what they will affect is actually the< the kind of Premium that you receive and the kind of Premium that you receive and also< also you know your prop right which is also you know your prop right which is the< the probability of profit now what about the probability of profit now what about index< index ETFs so this is of spy as you can index ETFs so this is of spy as you can see< see spy is much more expensive than CRM see spy is much more expensive than CRM right< right spy is $400 over dollars whereas right spy is $400 over dollars whereas CRM< CRM is about CRM is about $250< $250 but despite being even higher $250 but despite being even higher priced< priced you notice that the strike priced you notice that the strike differences< differences is one point so there are so differences is one point so there are so many< many strikes for you to choose from from many strikes for you to choose from from and< and if you were to take a look at the and if you were to take a look at the Delta< Delta difference is so much closer to Delta difference is so much closer to each< each other as well right there are about each other as well right there are about only< only two Delta difference from each only two Delta difference from each other< other so on the call side also same other so on the call side also same thing< thing about one to two Delta difference thing about one to two Delta difference from< from each other and this is where you from each other and this is where you have< have more flexibility in. the way you have more flexibility in the way you actually< actually construct your I in Condor actually construct your I in Condor right< right so these are the reasons why we right so these are the reasons why we want< want to choose index ETFs over want to choose index ETFs over individual< individual stocks now let's get into individual stocks now let's get into this< this selection of index ETFs and a lot this selection of index ETFs and a lot of< of people have been asking me so Davis of people have been asking me so Davis which< which IND ETFs do you think are good to which IND ETFs do you think are good to actually< actually you know trade options or to actually you know trade options or to trade< trade in in Condor specifically so one trade in in Condor specifically so one thing< thing to understand is that although we thing to understand is that although we have< have been talking that you know index have been talking that you know index ETFs< ETFs is the preference over individual ETFs is the preference over individual stocks< stocks when we are choosing them right stocks when we are choosing them right in< in terms of uh trading our strategies in terms of uh trading our strategies but< but the thing is that not all index ETFs but the thing is that not all index ETFs are< are actually created equal that means to are actually created equal that means to say< say there are certain index ETFs you do say there are certain index ETFs you do not< not want to trade all so let's get to not want to trade all so let's get to the< the point which index ETF should you the point which index ETF should you trade< trade your in condo go on so I'm going trade your in condo go on so I'm going to< to give you four of them and the very to give you four of them and the very first< first one is none other than spy right first one is none other than spy right spy< spy is the most popular index ETF spy is the most popular index ETF probably< probably the most widely traded one in probably the most widely traded one in the< the world right has the most uh highest the world right has the most uh highest volume< volume most liquid one and spy is the volume most liquid one and spy is the S&amp;P< S&amp;P 500 Index ETF so for those of you S&amp;P 500 Index ETF so for those of you who< who are new to trading options or maybe who are new to trading options or maybe even< even to the investing or trading world even to the investing or trading world then< then this is the one that you know most then this is the one that you know most people< people default to to trade right at the people default to to trade right at the start< start so why trade the iron on spy right start so why trade the iron on spy right the< the very first reason is because it's the very first reason is because it's extremely< extremely liquid and it's a highly extremely liquid and it's a highly traded< traded index ETF now next and very traded index ETF now next and very important< important one is that statistics have important one is that statistics have shown< shown that the realized move is smaller shown that the realized move is smaller than< than the expected move so this is very than the expected move so this is very important< important to understand guys because important to understand guys because when< when we are trading iron Condor what when we are trading iron Condor what we're< we're actually doing is that we're we're actually doing is that we're trading< trading the expected move now if you're trading the expected move now if you're not< not sure what the expected move is I've not sure what the expected move is I've already< already created a video on it just go to already created a video on it just go to my< my channel right the title is the number my channel right the title is the number one< one secret to becoming consistently one secret to becoming consistently profitable< profitable so there I detail exactly profitable so there I detail exactly what< what is expected move and how we can use what is expected move and how we can use it< it as an edge when we're trading options it as an edge when we're trading options right< right so the key thing to understand is right so the key thing to understand is that< that for our iron Condors to be net that for our iron Condors to be net profitable< profitable in the long term to have an profitable in the long term to have an edge< edge the realized move right that means edge the realized move right that means the< the actual move in the market has to be the actual move in the market has to be lesser< lesser than the expected move so the lesser than the expected move so the expected< expected move is pretty much the expected move is pretty much the theoretical< theoretical price that is being given theoretical price that is being given you< you know by the options pricing model so you know by the options pricing model so if< if you can have the realiz move is if you can have the realiz move is lesser< lesser than the expected move on the lesser than the expected move on the underlying< underlying then you know that we have an underlying then you know that we have an edge< edge when we're trading the expected edge when we're trading the expected move< move with strategies such as the iron move with strategies such as the iron Condor< Condor okay so as you can see down here Condor okay so as you can see down here spy< spy this is again a study done by the spy this is again a study done by the tasty< tasty trade team and they have shown tasty trade team and they have shown that< that regardless of the volatility you that regardless of the volatility you can< can see that the realized move is lesser can see that the realized move is lesser than< than the expected move in all instances than the expected move in all instances right< right so some people have mentioned that right so some people have mentioned that hey< hey you know the index ETF do not have hey you know the index ETF do not have that< that high of a volatility so maybe we that high of a volatility so maybe we don't< don't have that much of an edge but if don't have that much of an edge but if you< you notice down here even during times you notice down here even during times of< of very low low volatility what's of very low low volatility what's important< important to understand is that your important to understand is that your realized< realized move is still lesser than the realized move is still lesser than the expected< expected move as long as that is the expected move as long as that is the case< case regardless you know even though if case regardless you know even though if you< you get lesser premium in the long term you get lesser premium in the long term you< you still can become net profitable now you still can become net profitable now more< more importantly Studies have already more importantly Studies have already proven< proven that the I condol is profitable proven that the I condol is profitable on< on spy in the long term by the way if on spy in the long term by the way if you< you like this

com blueprint over to options with davis. com blueprint all< all right back to the video right again all right back to the video right again this< this is a study done by the tasty trade this is a study done by the tasty trade team< team as you can see down here what team as you can see down here what they've< they've done is that they put on a 20 they've done is that they put on a 20 Delta< Delta iron Condor which is $10 wide Delta iron Condor which is $10 wide right< right what does it mean by 20 Delta that right what does it mean by 20 Delta that means< means your short call and your short put means your short call and your short put all< all right down here this is 20 Deltas all right down here this is 20 Deltas right< right so they went for the 20 Delta right so they went for the 20 Delta short< short strikes and then you have $10 Wi short strikes and then you have $10 Wi on< on your wings right so that means from on your wings right so that means from here< here to here is $10 wi same thing as the here to here is $10 wi same thing as the other< other side as well okay so what they did other side as well okay so what they did is< is that they pretty much just put on is that they pretty much just put on this< this iron Condor and then they have two this iron Condor and then they have two different< different management style right they different management style right they have< have one where they just get out of have one where they just get out of expiration< expiration right they hold it all the expiration right they hold it all the way< way to expiration and then put it on way to expiration and then put it on again< again after that and the other one is at again after that and the other one is at 21< 21 DTE that means once there's 21 days 21 DTE that means once there's 21 days to< to exploration left they close out the to exploration left they close out the trade< trade and then they put on another iron trade and then they put on another iron Condor< Condor all right so they just do this Condor all right so they just do this continuously< continuously and as you can see in both continuously and as you can see in both cases< cases they are actually profitable cases they are actually profitable although< although you know holding to expiration although you know holding to expiration you< you know towards 2011 onwards you pretty you know towards 2011 onwards you pretty much< much have you know not too good of a much have you know not too good of a performance< performance right so that is why when it performance right so that is why when it comes< comes to trading the iron Condor we want comes to trading the iron Condor we want to< to manage them at 21 DTE basically it's to manage them at 21 DTE basically it's just< just to exit our trade at 21 DTE now the just to exit our trade at 21 DTE now the key< key word down here I want to emphasize key word down here I want to emphasize on< on is in the long term right because a on is in the long term right because a lot< lot of people straight away see this lot of people straight away see this chart< chart and graph and thinking hey it's chart and graph and thinking hey it's going< going to be profitable and they jump going to be profitable and they jump into< into trading you know this iron Condor into trading you know this iron Condor we< we don't really understanding this chart we don't really understanding this chart right< right because they think that hey every right because they think that hey every day< day is going to be profitable or every day is going to be profitable or every month< month is going to be profitable but what month is going to be profitable but what they< they don't realize is that there'll be they don't realize is that there'll be times< times where you could go through a draw times where you could go through a draw down< down right some people go through you down right some people go through you know< know a losing strick of maybe three know a losing strick of maybe three trades< trades and they think that the iron trades and they think that the iron condol< condol doesn't work but if you were to condol doesn't work but if you were to really< really just zoom in into this chart down really just zoom in into this chart down here< here you will Noti here you will Noti that< that there are times where there are that there are times where there are draw< draw Downs right you can see that there draw Downs right you can see that there are< are draw Downs at c number of time that are draw Downs at c number of time that these< these are the times where when you put these are the times where when you put on< on the I Condor you're going to lose and on the I Condor you're going to lose and it's< it's possible that you're going to lose it's possible that you're going to lose multiple< multiple trades in a row right because multiple trades in a row right because the< the conditions are just not suitable at the conditions are just not suitable at that< that point of time when you're putting that point of time when you're putting on< on the iron cond or the market have just on the iron cond or the market have just you< you know bigger movement than usual you know bigger movement than usual right< right maybe it just exceed the expected right maybe it just exceed the expected move< move so as you can see down here in 2009 move so as you can see down here in 2009 you< you know there's a period of time you know there's a period of time whereby< whereby you know if you were to put on whereby you know if you were to put on the< the trade or you you got into the iron the trade or you you got into the iron Condor< Condor during those times you could have Condor during those times you could have lost< lost money it took a while before you lost money it took a while before you got< got it back same as 2011 2013 you know got it back same as 2011 2013 you know even even even 2016< 2016 and 2016 and 2017< 2017 at towards the end right but what 2017 at towards the end right but what you< you need to understand this is the long you need to understand this is the long term< term right so if you get into a point term right so if you get into a point where< where you started to trade the I condo where you started to trade the I condo and< and you realize that hey you've been and you realize that hey you've been losing< losing you know a few trades in a row losing you know a few trades in a row just< just realize that this is all part and just realize that this is all part and pass< pass of trading right if you go and pass of trading right if you go and listen< listen to other people you know YouTube listen to other people you know YouTube videos< videos where they say that you know you videos where they say that you know you cannot< cannot lose money training iron condos cannot lose money training iron condos then< then I would be very wary of them then I would be very wary of them because< because every strategy you put on always because every strategy you put on always have< have some kind of risk so the most have some kind of risk so the most important< important thing to understand down here important thing to understand down here is< is that when you take a look at this is that when you take a look at this chart< chart down here it says the average chart down here it says the average realized< realized move and the average expected realized move and the average expected move< move average average just means is move average average just means is everything< everything add up together divided the everything add up together divided the number< number of you know instances which means number of you know instances which means to< to say there are certain times where the to say there are certain times where the price< price underlying can actually exceed the price underlying can actually exceed the expected< expected move so when you aggregate them expected move so when you aggregate them all< all together in the long term that's all together in the long term that's when< when the average realized move will be when the average realized move will be lesser< lesser than the expected move which lesser than the expected move which means< means to say you do expect such kind of means to say you do expect such kind of draw< draw downs from time to time so that is draw downs from time to time so that is why< why very important when you're trading why very important when you're trading the< the iron Condor along with any other the iron Condor along with any other strategy< strategy you want to look at the strategy you want to look at the long-term< long-term profitability rather than just long-term profitability rather than just the< the next few trade right so this is one the next few trade right so this is one thing< thing that I always mention always look thing that I always mention always look at< at the next 100 trades instead of the at the next 100 trades instead of the next< next what three to 10 trades now the next what three to 10 trades now the next< next index ETF that I think is really next index ETF that I think is really good< good for trading the iron Condor is the good for trading the iron Condor is the iwm< iwm so the iwm is the Russo 2000 Index iwm so the iwm is the Russo 2000 Index ETF< ETF so why trade the Ion condol on iwm ETF so why trade the Ion condol on iwm well< well same thing it is also very liquid well same thing it is also very liquid and< and highly traded and it is lower price and highly traded and it is lower price than< than spy right which means you can than spy right which means you can actually< actually construct a less Capital actually construct a less Capital intensive< intensive iron Condor right that's with intensive iron Condor right that's with Dynamic< Dynamic wings or a relatively less risky Dynamic wings or a relatively less risky iron< iron Condor with fixed wings so here's iron Condor with fixed wings so here's exactly< exactly what I mean right so let's just exactly what I mean right so let's just take< take a look at the Dynamics Wings right take a look at the Dynamics Wings right now< now so Dynamic Wings basically what it now so Dynamic Wings basically what it means< means is that when you're constructing means is that when you're constructing the< the long side of your iron Condor you're the long side of your iron Condor you're looking< looking at Delta instead of dollar looking at Delta instead of dollar points< points right so let's say for example we points right so let's say for example we have< have an ion condo structure down here have an ion condo structure down here all< all right so this is for the call side all right so this is for the call side and< and then you have for the put side all and then you have for the put side all right< right so down here you can see the right so down here you can see the example< example used by the tasty trade team is example used by the tasty trade team is that< that they're using the 16 Delta options that they're using the 16 Delta options right< right so this is 16 Delta for the short right so this is 16 Delta for the short call< call and for the short putut now what call and for the short putut now what about< about the long putut and for the long about the long putut and for the long call< call so this is where instead of you call so this is where instead of you know< know usually what most people do is that know usually what most people do is that they< they find a $5 wide right either $5 wi they find a $5 wide right either $5 wi or< or $10 wide kind of uh Wings instead or $10 wide kind of uh Wings instead this< this time what you're going to do is by this time what you're going to do is by looking< looking at the Delta so let's just focus looking at the Delta so let's just focus at< at the 10 Delta wings so what it means at the 10 Delta wings so what it means is< is that you go all the way to the 10 is that you go all the way to the 10 Delta< Delta on both sides and that's where you Delta on both sides and that's where you place< place your wings right so how much risk place your wings right so how much risk is< is that it really depends on the is that it really depends on the volatility< volatility at that point in time right volatility at that point in time right the< the volatility is high then the 10 delta the volatility is high then the 10 delta wing< wing could be quite far apart right but wing could be quite far apart right but if< if when the volatility is low then the if when the volatility is low then the 10< 10 delta wing will probably be nearer to 10 delta wing will probably be nearer to where< where the 16 Delta is so this all really where the 16 Delta is so this all really depends< depends on you know the underlying depends on you know the underlying volatility< volatility so basically what this means volatility so basically what this means is< is that you're using the long Wings is that you're using the long Wings right< right you're defining them by using right you're defining them by using Delta< Delta so as you can see down here this Delta so as you can see down here this is< is a study done by the tasty trade team is a study done by the tasty trade team and< and they measured all different types of and they measured all different types of wings< wings right they tested the different wings right they tested the different kind< kind of wings with the 16 Delta short kind of wings with the 16 Delta short strikes< strikes so as you can see in all cases strikes so as you can see in all cases they< they actually all net profitable so this they actually all net profitable so this is< is the average p&amp;l right which means to is the average p&amp;l right which means to say< say as you can see it's a positive say as you can see it's a positive number< number that means it is positive in the number that means it is positive in the long< long term overall now so why is this long term overall now so why is this less< less Capital intensive so let's take a less Capital intensive so let's take a look< look at the option chain to understand look at the option chain to understand this< this a little bit better so as you can this a little bit better so as you can see< see down here this is of spy you can see see down here this is of spy you can see that< that we have the short option down here that we have the short option down here at< at 16 Delta and we have the long option at 16 Delta and we have the long option where< where we Define the wings at 10 Delta so where we Define the wings at 10 Delta so this< this is only on the put side right so this is only on the put side right so I'll< I'll just show the put side because the I'll just show the put side because the call< call side is going to be similar so as call side is going to be similar so as you< you can see see down here if you reach you can see see down here if you reach to< to the 101 it's going to be $10 Y which to the 101 it's going to be $10 Y which means< means to say your iron Condor risk is means to say your iron Condor risk is roughly< roughly going to be you know about roughly going to be you know about $11,000< $11,000 uh less the credit that you $11,000 uh less the credit that you receive< receive for you know this structure for receive for you know this structure for this< this iron Condor so it should be roughly this iron Condor so it should be roughly around< around $8 to $900 R depending on how around $8 to $900 R depending on how much< much credit you can get right so this is much credit you can get right so this is for< for spy now what about for iwm now you for spy now what about for iwm now you notice< notice for iwm if you were to use the notice for iwm if you were to use the same< same Delta 16 and 10 Deltas it's only $5 same Delta 16 and 10 Deltas it's only $5 wide< wide which means to say your risk for wide which means to say your risk for this< this trade is less than $500 right once this trade is less than $500 right once you< you minus off the credit you you receive you minus off the credit you you receive for< for putting on the structure so which for putting on the structure so which means< means to say if you have a smaller uh means to say if you have a smaller uh starting< starting Capital then you might want to starting Capital then you might want to consider< consider going for the iwm instead of consider going for the iwm instead of the< the spy and let's say for example you the spy and let's say for example you have< have a bigger Capital where you know have a bigger Capital where you know you're< you're able to reach about $1,000 per you're able to reach about $1,000 per trade< trade then this is where you know you trade then this is where you know you could< could choose to go with the Spy right so could choose to go with the Spy right so that< that is why I say it's less Capital that is why I say it's less Capital intensive< intensive when it comes to the dynamic intensive when it comes to the dynamic wings< wings now what. about for fixed wings wings now what about for fixed wings that< that means you have a fixed dollar Wing that means you have a fixed dollar Wing right< right either $5 or $10 it is actually right either $5 or $10 it is actually less< less risk when you use it on the iwm why less risk when you use it on the iwm why so< so let's take a look at the Spy down so let's take a look at the Spy down here< here so again the Spy we go for the 16 here so again the Spy we go for the 16 Delta< Delta and we go $5 wings so if we go $5 Delta and we go $5 wings so if we go $5 Wings< Wings will be the 44 strike and you Wings will be the 44 strike and you notice< notice it is at the 13 Deltas whereas notice it is at the 13 Deltas whereas for< for you know for the iwm at 175 which is for you know for the iwm at 175 which is $5< $5 away it is at 10 Delta so Delta $5 away it is at 10 Delta so Delta actually< actually gives us also an indication of actually gives us also an indication of the< the likelihood of it being in the money the likelihood of it being in the money at< at expiration right so for example a 13 at expiration right so for example a 13 Delta< Delta long win just means that at Delta long win just means that at expiration< expiration there's a 133% chance that expiration there's a 133% chance that this< this will be in the money whereas for this will be in the money whereas for iwm< iwm right the same $5 wide away strike iwm right the same $5 wide away strike is< is only 10 Delta that means there's only is only 10 Delta that means there's only 10%< 10% chance that it's going to be in the 10% chance that it's going to be in the money< money right slight difference but as you money right slight difference but as you can< can see from here it's slightly less can see from here it's slightly less riskier< riskier on the iwm compared to this spy riskier on the iwm compared to this spy right< right so that is one of the another right so that is one of the another reason< reason why you might want to consider reason why you might want to consider choosing< choosing iwm over spy when you're just choosing iwm over spy when you're just starting< starting out now the final reason and starting out now the final reason and most< most importantly is that statistics have most importantly is that statistics have also< also shown that the realized move is also shown that the realized move is smaller< smaller than the expected move right smaller than the expected move right this< this is the whole reason why we can have this is the whole reason why we can have an< an edge when we are trading the iron an edge when we are trading the iron Condor< Condor so that's also one of the reasons Condor so that's also one of the reasons why< why I generally do not like to trade why I generally do not like to trade individual< individual stocks when it comes to individual stocks when it comes to trading< trading the iron Condor strategy is trading the iron Condor strategy is because< because most of the time right the red because most of the time right the red lights< lights move can be bigger than expected lights move can be bigger than expected move< move especially when the earnings come move especially when the earnings come or< or when there's you know individual or when there's you know individual stock< stock news like for example maybe they stock news like for example maybe they have< have a bad product launch or maybe you have a bad product launch or maybe you know< know the CEO something happened to him know the CEO something happened to him there's< there's going to be a big adverse there's going to be a big adverse movement< movement where it's going to affect you movement where it's going to affect you know< know the price movement is going to most know the price movement is going to most likely< likely have a very big gap up or down likely have a very big gap up or down all< all right now you might be asking this all right now you might be asking this question< question right now after I've just question right now after I've just shared< shared with you this two index ETF but shared with you this two index ETF but Davis< Davis I'm afraid of getting assigned if Davis I'm afraid of getting assigned if my< my iron Condor is in the money right so my iron Condor is in the money right so this< this is one of the biggest fears that this is one of the biggest fears that many< many people have is that their iron many people have is that their iron Condors< Condors get in the money and they're Condors get in the money and they're afraid< afraid of getting assigned right that afraid of getting assigned right that means< means if you're getting assigned if you means if you're getting assigned if you get< get assigned on the call site you're get assigned on the call site you're going< going to be short 100 shares of the going to be short 100 shares of the underlying< underlying or if you're assigned on your underlying or if you're assigned on your short< short put site you're going to be long short put site you're going to be long 100< 100 shares and this is going to have 100 shares and this is going to have Margin< Margin Call if you do not have you know Margin Call if you do not have you know sufficient< sufficient funds to actually you know sufficient funds to actually you know buy< buy those 100 shares or shot those 100 buy those 100 shares or shot those 100 shares< shares so this is where the fear that a shares so this is where the fear that a lot< lot of people come so first of all if lot of people come so first of all if you< you actually get ass sign please go you actually get ass sign please go ahead< ahead to take a look at my video I ahead to take a look at my video I already< already have a video which I've already already have a video which I've already created< created called the I Condor reversal created called the I Condor reversal strategy< strategy where I just share with you strategy where I just share with you exactly< exactly what to do if you're assigned exactly what to do if you're assigned but< but second of all if you're totally but second of all if you're totally afraid< afraid of getting assigned at all in the afraid of getting assigned at all in the first< first place and you do not even want to first place and you do not even want to have< have this early assignment then don't have this early assignment then don't worry< worry I got your back then you want to worry I got your back then you want to trade< trade these two underlyings instead and trade these two underlyings instead and that< that is the XSP all right so the XSP is that is the XSP all right so the XSP is actually< actually a cash Shadow index options and actually a cash Shadow index options and it's< it's essentially the cash setled version it's essentially the cash setled version of< of spy right it's the mini SPX index of spy right it's the mini SPX index options< options which is the same size as spy options which is the same size as spy right< right if you notice on the left hand right if you notice on the left hand side< side this is spy on the right hand side side this is spy on the right hand side it< it is XSP and you notice that the price it is XSP and you notice that the price movement< movement is virtually the same right movement is virtually the same right they're< they're actually exactly the same the they're actually exactly the same the only< only difference is that one is European only difference is that one is European options< options which is XSP that means you do options which is XSP that means you do not< not get early assignment right and it's not get early assignment right and it's cash< cash settle right for spy American cash settle right for spy American options< options right the other difference is options right the other difference is that< that you know the price difference is that you know the price difference is just< just you know by maybe a dollar or two just you know by maybe a dollar or two away< away right as you can see on the Spy is away right as you can see on the Spy is about< about 467 whereas on the XSP about 469 about 467 whereas on the XSP about 469 right< right but it's not that much difference right but it's not that much difference so< so why trade iron Condors on XSP so so why trade iron Condors on XSP so first< first of all it is Cash settle which first of all it is Cash settle which means< means that there is no chance of you means that there is no chance of you getting< getting assigned shares hence there's no getting assigned shares hence there's no need< need for you to worry about getting into need for you to worry about getting into a< a margin call so this really helps out a a margin call so this really helps out a lot< lot of people in terms of their fear of lot of people in terms of their fear of getting< getting assigned because there's no way getting assigned because there's no way you< you can get assigned shares on XSP now you can get assigned shares on XSP now next< next there's no early assignment right next there's no early assignment right you< you can hold all the way to expiration you can hold all the way to expiration if< if you choose to so XSP is on the if you choose to so XSP is on the europan< europan style option which means to say europan style option which means to say the< the buyer of that option the buyer of that option can< can only choose to exercise the option can only choose to exercise the option at< at expiration they cannot exercise it at expiration they cannot exercise it before< before that even though it's in the before that even though it's in the money< money right this is unlike the American money right this is unlike the American style< style which is on individual stocks and style which is on individual stocks and index< index ETFs whereby if it's in the money index ETFs whereby if it's in the money they< they have the option to actually just they have the option to actually just exercise< exercise it at any time they want right exercise it at any time they want right but< but for XSP no such thing so again no but for XSP no such thing so again no need< need to worry about early assignment and need to worry about early assignment and if< if you hold to expiration basically the if you hold to expiration basically the broker< broker will just settle the p&amp;l in cash broker will just settle the p&amp;l in cash right< right so again you do not have to worry right so again you do not have to worry about< about any shares assignment because that about any shares assignment because that does< does not happen so people have asked me does not happen so people have asked me before< before what actually happens at before what actually happens at expiration< expiration right let's say for example expiration right let's say for example if< if you lost money if you lost money if you lost money if you lost money basically< basically the broker will just settle basically the broker will just settle any< any pnl in cash right so you will just any pnl in cash right so you will just take< take a look at your cash site and if you take a look at your cash site and if you lost< lost money right basically the cash will lost money right basically the cash will be< be taken off of the account and if you be taken off of the account and if you have< have uh profitable the credit will just have uh profitable the credit will just stay< stay there right or if you have just you stay there right or if you have just you know< know maybe 50% profit the broker will know maybe 50% profit the broker will just< just remove like 50% of the credit which just remove like 50% of the credit which they< they gave you right at the start right they gave you right at the start right so< so basically it's all settled in in your so basically it's all settled in in your cash< cash account so essentially it's the cash account so essentially it's the same< same as spy with slightly wider bin and same as spy with slightly wider bin and R< R spread and slight price difference but R spread and slight price difference but for< for the most part it's essentially the for the most part it's essentially the same< same so if you're worried about getting same so if you're worried about getting a< a signed just trade the iron condo on a signed just trade the iron condo on XSP< XSP now the next one is mun so what is XSP now the next one is mun so what is mun< mun so mun is essentially the cash mun so mun is essentially the cash settled< settled version of the iwm so for XSP is settled version of the iwm so for XSP is the< the cash settle version of spy and run the cash settle version of spy and run is< is the cash SLE version of iwm and it's is the cash SLE version of iwm and it's the< the mini run index options which is the the mini run index options which is the same< same size as iwm as you can see the same size as iwm as you can see the price< price movement is exactly the same right price movement is exactly the same right there's< there's not much difference in terms of there's not much difference in terms of the< the price movement so why trade iron the price movement so why trade iron Condors< Condors on emrod well first of all it is Condors on emrod well first of all it is Cash< Cash settle which means that there is no Cash settle which means that there is no chance< chance of you getting assigned shares chance of you getting assigned shares hence< hence no need to worry about Margin Call hence no need to worry about Margin Call same< same thing again same thing no early same thing again same thing no early assignment< assignment right you can hold all the assignment right you can hold all the way< way to expiration if you choose to and way to expiration if you choose to and if< if you hold to expiration the broker if you hold to expiration the broker will< will settle the p&amp;l in cash as well and will settle the p&amp;l in cash as well and essentially< essentially the same as other VM with essentially the same as other VM with slightly< slightly wider B our spread and slight slightly wider B our spread and slight price< price difference which doesn't make too price difference which doesn't make too big< big of a difference when you're trading big of a difference when you're trading it< it and it is lower price than XSP which it and it is lower price than XSP which means< means you can construct a less Capital means you can construct a less Capital intensive< intensive iron Condor with Dynamic wings intensive iron Condor with Dynamic wings or< or a relatively less riskier iron Condor or a relatively less riskier iron Condor with< with fixed Wing so basically it just with fixed Wing so basically it just means< means to say that if you have a smaller means to say that if you have a smaller Capital< Capital if you're just starting out you Capital if you're just starting out you want< want lesser risk then just go for the want lesser risk then just go for the Emron< Emron okay so now how do you trade the Emron okay so now how do you trade the iron< iron Condor on them and it's a very good iron Condor on them and it's a very good question< question and I've actually addressed question and I've actually addressed this< this in another video of mine which I've this in another video of mine which I've already< already created it's called the $10,000 already created it's called the $10,000 iron< iron Condor trading plan which I give iron Condor trading plan which I give you< you you know a very stepbystep guide I you you know a very stepbystep guide I share< share with you you know all the steps share with you you know all the steps from< from beginning all the way towards the from beginning all the way towards the end< end you know how you're going to end you know how you're going to construct< construct them how you're going to trade construct them how you're going to trade them< them and how you going to manage them them and how you going to manage them how< how you're going to exit them all right how you're going to exit them all right so< so if you hav't watched that video go so if you hav't watched that video go ahead< ahead and watch that video all right so ahead and watch that video all right so these< these are the four best stocks for these are the four best stocks for trading< trading I in Condors spy iwm and if trading I in Condors spy iwm and if you're< you're fre of assignment go for XSP or you're fre of assignment go for XSP or the< the embr by the way if you like this the embr by the way if you like this video< video then you're absolutely going to video then you're absolutely going to love< love this next video which I have for love this next video which I have for you< you so go ahead and watch that video you so go ahead and watch that video right< right

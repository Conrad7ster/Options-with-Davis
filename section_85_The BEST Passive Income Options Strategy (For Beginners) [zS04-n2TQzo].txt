com so< so it says that passive income is money so it says that passive income is money that< that you earn either automatically or that you earn either automatically or without< without putting in much effort right so without putting in much effort right so they< they give a few examples so you have a they give a few examples so you have a rental< rental income so basically you know you rental income so basically you know you have< have to find the property first then you have to find the property first then you have< have to do up the place and then you have to do up the place and then you have< have to find the tenant right do all have to find the tenant right do all this< this work once and then once you've got this work once and then once you've got the< the tenant then that's where you're the tenant then that's where you're gonna< gonna get you know your rental income gonna get you know your rental income and< and then dividends income as well so and then dividends income as well so maybe< maybe you have to find this uh dividend maybe you have to find this uh dividend stocks< stocks those fundamentally good dividend stocks those fundamentally good dividend stocks< stocks and then once you've done the stocks and then once you've done the work< work once invest in it and then the work once invest in it and then the dividends< dividends will just keep paying out to dividends will just keep paying out to you< you right same as interest income as you right same as interest income as well< well so maybe you buy into some bonds well so maybe you buy into some bonds government< government bonds or those kind of fixed government bonds or those kind of fixed security< security fixed income securities well security fixed income securities well basically< basically you just put it inside there basically you just put it inside there and< and then they will just pay you an and then they will just pay you an income< income right depending on how often it income right depending on how often it is< is right so this is basically the is right so this is basically the definition< definition of passive income so when it definition of passive income so when it comes< comes to options we also want to build comes to options we also want to build that< that sort of passive income as well so that sort of passive income as well so when< when it comes to options we want to find when it comes to options we want to find a< a strategy where we only have to do the a strategy where we only have to do the work< work once and then receive an income for work once and then receive an income for it< it so what this means is that we want a it so what this means is that we want a strategy< strategy where there is a high strategy where there is a high probability< probability or profit and we do not want probability or profit and we do not want any< any management of the trade where we can any management of the trade where we can hold< hold to expiration because you know most hold to expiration because you know most of< of the strategies we do want to manage of the strategies we do want to manage at< at some time or another right right at some time or another right right maybe< maybe because the Delta has gone you maybe because the Delta has gone you know< know a little bit too high we want to know a little bit too high we want to change< change the trade a little bit maybe we change the trade a little bit maybe we want< want to you know adjust the Theta we want to you know adjust the Theta we want< want to roll it so most of the time want to roll it so most of the time there< there is some sort of management but for there is some sort of management but for this< this strategy we want to try and build this strategy we want to try and build this< this strategy where there's no this strategy where there's no management< management involved right also that also management involved right also that also means< means that there must be no risk of means that there must be no risk of assignment< assignment on shares right because if assignment on shares right because if you're< you're going to get a sign of the shares you're going to get a sign of the shares net< net then it's not going to be that net then it's not going to be that passive< passive right because you need to worry passive right because you need to worry about< about how to unwind those shares right about how to unwind those shares right if< if you're going to be long shares you're if you're going to be long shares you're going< going to be short shares there's going going to be short shares there's going to< to be quite a problem for your account to be quite a problem for your account especially< especially if you don't have the funds especially if you don't have the funds you< you know the margin to hold on to those you know the margin to hold on to those shares< shares and more importantly we need to shares and more importantly we need to have< have a statistical Edge over time so have a statistical Edge over time so this< this is the basis of how we want to this is the basis of how we want to create< create this passive income right through create this passive income right through options< options so what is this strategy that options so what is this strategy that can< can help us generate a passive income can help us generate a passive income through< through options then this strategy is through options then this strategy is none< none other than the put broken wing none other than the put broken wing butterfly< butterfly right so this is on the cash butterfly right so this is on the cash settled< settled index options very important we settled index options very important we only< only want to do this on cash Shadow only want to do this on cash Shadow index< index options and I'll get into the index options and I'll get into the reasons< reasons why so basically it's the put reasons why so basically it's the put broken< broken wing butterfly or in short the broken wing butterfly or in short the put put put right< right the boob that sounds weird I think right the boob that sounds weird I think it's< it's the put BWB that sounds is better it's the put BWB that sounds is better so< so we call it the put BWB all right so so we call it the put BWB all right so what< what is this put BWB the put broken wing what is this put BWB the put broken wing a< a butterfly so the broken wing butterfly a butterfly so the broken wing butterfly is< is basically a combination of two is basically a combination of two different< different types of spread right first different types of spread right first you< you have the put credit spread and then you have the put credit spread and then you< you have the put debit spread so the you have the put debit spread so the whole< whole idea down here is to use the whole idea down here is to use the credit< credit spread which is on the left hand credit spread which is on the left hand side< side down here so you can see down here side down here so you can see down here this< this is where the put credit spread is this is where the put credit spread is where< where you receive a credit when you put where you receive a credit when you put on< on this spread and then on the right on this spread and then on the right hand< hand side right on the right hand side hand side right on the right hand side I'm< I'm just going to draw it like that this I'm just going to draw it like that this is< is where the debit spread is so the is where the debit spread is so the whole< whole idea here is to use the credit whole idea here is to use the credit spread spread spread to< to sort of Finance the debit spread over to sort of Finance the debit spread over here< here so this way you know there is no here so this way you know there is no risk< risk to the upside so the way we are risk to the upside so the way we are going< going to construct this put broken wing going to construct this put broken wing butterfly< butterfly is that there is going to be butterfly is that there is going to be zero< zero risk to the upside and even some zero risk to the upside and even some small< small profits right so this way if the small profits right so this way if the markets< markets you know really shoots to the markets you know really shoots to the Moon< Moon well at least we are still going to Moon well at least we are still going to get< get some sort of profit so there's only get some sort of profit so there's only risk< risk to one side which is on the risk to one side which is on the downside< downside okay so you can also see this downside okay so you can also see this if< if you think about it it is the defined if you think about it it is the defined risk< risk version of the put ratio spread now risk version of the put ratio spread now I've< I've talked about the put ratio spread I've talked about the put ratio spread quite< quite a bit on my channel and as you quite a bit on my channel and as you know< know it's one of my you know favorite know it's one of my you know favorite strategies< strategies that I put on so the put strategies that I put on so the put ratio< ratio spread is the undefined risk ratio spread is the undefined risk version< version so with the put broken wing version so with the put broken wing butterfly< butterfly what you're essentially doing butterfly what you're essentially doing is< is putting on the put ratio spread down is putting on the put ratio spread down here< here and then you're buying you know here and then you're buying you know this< this put option down here you're buying this put option down here you're buying a< a further out of the money put option so a further out of the money put option so as< as to Define your max risk so this way as to Define your max risk so this way you< you know it is much more suitable if you know it is much more suitable if you're< you're just starting out because this you're just starting out because this way< way you know you do not have to be way you know you do not have to be worried< worried about this unlimited risk or the worried about this unlimited risk or the fact< fact that you know the the market will fact that you know the the market will go< go all the way to zero you can lose all go all the way to zero you can lose all your< your money right so in a sense there is your money right so in a sense there is some< some kind of an insurance because of some kind of an insurance because of this< this long put option down here for those this long put option down here for those of< of you who. prefer the visual learning of you who prefer the visual learning right< right then you can see how it looks like right then you can see how it looks like on< on the chart so this is on the XSP which on the chart so this is on the XSP which is< is the mini SPX index options so as you is the mini SPX index options so as you can< can see down here this is where we are can see down here this is where we are going< going to have our two short options and going to have our two short options and then< then down here we have the long put and then down here we have the long put and then< then another further out of the money then another further out of the money long< long put option all right so if you just long put option all right so if you just take< take a look at this if you're new to all take a look at this if you're new to all this< this it can get a little bit confusing I this it can get a little bit confusing I understand< understand definitely especially if understand definitely especially if you're< you're just coming on from you know you you're just coming on from you know you just< just put on a simple spread like maybe a just put on a simple spread like maybe a credit< credit spread or something like that credit spread or something like that right< right so for this you can see down here right so for this you can see down here there< there are two put options at the same there are two put options at the same strike< strike right that is what makes it a strike right that is what makes it a butterfly< butterfly right so the battery butterfly butterfly right so the battery butterfly option< option strategy basically you have two option strategy basically you have two short< short options at the same strike and short options at the same strike and then< then for the broken wing butterfly then for the broken wing butterfly basically< basically it's a very uneven style of basically it's a very uneven style of butterfly< butterfly right because most of the time butterfly right because most of the time the< the normal butterfly is a very even one the normal butterfly is a very even one so< so if I were to draw the p l graph for so if I were to draw the p l graph for the< the normal uh book uh butterfly right the normal uh book uh butterfly right you< you will you will see that it actually you will you will see that it actually looks< looks something like this right so this looks something like this right so this is< is the the zero p l line so basically is the the zero p l line so basically you'll< you'll see that this is pretty you'll see that this is pretty equidistance< equidistance from here to here most of equidistance from here to here most of the< the time right but for this you notice the time right but for this you notice that< that we have skewed it a little bit so that we have skewed it a little bit so that< that as you can see from the previous p that as you can see from the previous p l< l graph here let me just remove all l graph here let me just remove all these< these drawings again these drawings again so< so you can see that we have secured it so you can see that we have secured it so< so that on the right hand side this uh so that on the right hand side this uh debit< debit spread down here is actually the debit spread down here is actually the width< width is much smaller compared to this width is much smaller compared to this credit< credit spread on the left hand side all credit spread on the left hand side all right< right so when you skew it this way you right so when you skew it this way you are< are able to actually remove any wrist to are able to actually remove any wrist to the< the upside from here okay so this is how the upside from here okay so this is how it< it looks like on the chart So based on it looks like on the chart So based on the< the chart you might be wondering so the chart you might be wondering so where< where is the profit Zone all right so I where is the profit Zone all right so I have< have done this for you you can just see have done this for you you can just see down< down here anywhere in the green zone down here anywhere in the green zone this< this is where you get profits right the this is where you get profits right the biggest< biggest profit is from this point down biggest profit is from this point down here here here all< all the way to here because this is all the way to here because this is where< where you get your tent right so if we where you get your tent right so if we go< go to the p l graph here this is the go to the p l graph here this is the tent< tent over here right so anything above tent over here right so anything above this< this tent you're gonna just get the this tent you're gonna just get the minimal< minimal profits which is basically the minimal profits which is basically the credit< credit which you sold for so this is for credit which you sold for so this is for the< the minimum profit so as long you know the minimum profit so as long you know if< if it's above this long put option down if it's above this long put option down here< here you know the market can shoot all here you know the market can shoot all the< the way to the sky you will still get the way to the sky you will still get the< the minimum profit which you sold this the minimum profit which you sold this whole< whole put broken wing butterfly for now whole put broken wing butterfly for now on< on the other hand because you have on the other hand because you have already< already kept your max risk you know you already kept your max risk you know you the< the almost that you can lose is only up the almost that you can lose is only up to< to this point down here right depending to this point down here right depending on< on where you buy your long put strike so on where you buy your long put strike so if< if the market was to crash all the way if the market was to crash all the way down< down let's say even goes to zero dollars down let's say even goes to zero dollars guess< guess what you're not going to lose guess what you're not going to lose everything< everything because you only can lose everything because you only can lose what< what you have a risk for the trade so in what you have a risk for the trade so in this< this case it's up to this point where this case it's up to this point where you< you have bought this long put spread so you have bought this long put spread so again< again this is why it's very good for again this is why it's very good for beginners< beginners especially you're just beginners especially you're just starting< starting out because you already know up starting out because you already know up front< front what is the max risk going to be front what is the max risk going to be and< and it's going to really help you in and it's going to really help you in your< your capital location as well as your your capital location as well as your psychology< psychology okay now the other thing psychology okay now the other thing about< about the put broken wing butterfly is about the put broken wing butterfly is that< that it is very versatile right and can that it is very versatile right and can be< be constructed according to your Market be constructed according to your Market View< View and objectives right so there's no View and objectives right so there's no one< one right way to construct this put one right way to construct this put broken< broken wing butterfly all right so let's broken wing butterfly all right so let's say< say for example you know you might want say for example you know you might want more< more credit up front so this is one way more credit up front so this is one way that< that you can adjust it you notice that that you can adjust it you notice that the< the credit down here you can see the credit down here you can see although< although it's you know very minimal you although it's you know very minimal you can't< can't really see much of a difference can't really see much of a difference here< here but if you would compare it to the here but if you would compare it to the one< one previously you will notice that this one previously you will notice that this one< one is much lower but then you get a one is much lower but then you get a much< much higher tent so to speak right so much higher tent so to speak right so down< down here you can see the tent here is down here you can see the tent here is much< much higher but for this the tent is much higher but for this the tent is much< much lower but you get a higher minimum much lower but you get a higher minimum profits< profits on the right hand side so profits on the right hand side so basically< basically what your outlook for this is basically what your outlook for this is is< is that you know it might be slightly is that you know it might be slightly more< more bullish and you think that the more bullish and you think that the market< market is has a better chance for it to market is has a better chance for it to go< go up than to go down so that is why you go up than to go down so that is why you know< know you don't need that much big of a know you don't need that much big of a protection< protection in terms of this tent right protection in terms of this tent right basically< basically if you want more protection to basically if you want more protection to the< the downside you're worried that the the downside you're worried that the market< market you know is really going to crash market you know is really going to crash then< then you want to build one whereby you then you want to build one whereby you know< know this tent is bigger but the know this tent is bigger but the trade-off< trade-off is that you know you forego trade-off is that you know you forego The< The Upfront credit right The Upfront credit right so< so if the market goes up you receive so if the market goes up you receive lesser< lesser for this spread compared to if lesser for this spread compared to if you< you were to construct it this way on the you were to construct it this way on the other< other hand if the market really goes other hand if the market really goes down< down then guess what this is going to be down then guess what this is going to be better< better because you notice your break better because you notice your break even< even is actually further away your break even is actually further away your break even< even is 431. 54 that is why you know your even is 431.

54 that is why you know your win< win rate is slightly higher whereas for. win rate is slightly higher whereas for this< this your win rate is only 87. 43 and you this your win rate is only 87.

43 and you can< can see the break-even price is slightly can see the break-even price is slightly higher< higher okay so again this comes down to higher okay so again this comes down to your< your outlook of the market now on the your outlook of the market now on the other< other hand you can actually shift your other hand you can actually shift your short< short strikes further up right so some short strikes further up right so some people< people have asked before you know what people have asked before you know what is< is the Delta that you use so this again is the Delta that you use so this again really< really comes down to your outlet off the really comes down to your outlet off the market< market now generally what I like to do market now generally what I like to do is< is somewhere around the 20 Delta but is somewhere around the 20 Delta but again< again it is really up to your outlook if again it is really up to your outlook if you're< you're much more bullish you can always you're much more bullish you can always shift< shift this in right basically closer to shift this in right basically closer to the< the market so you're getting a higher the market so you're getting a higher Delta< Delta right anything above 20 maybe 25 Delta right anything above 20 maybe 25 30< 30 35 up to you and what you know notice 30 35 up to you and what you know notice is< is that as you shift this closer to is that as you shift this closer to where< where the current market price is where the current market price is basically< basically the market price is somewhere basically the market price is somewhere above< above here you can't see down here right above here you can't see down here right market< market price is somewhere over there market price is somewhere over there right< right so you can see there is some room right so you can see there is some room for< for the market to actually go down to for the market to actually go down to actually< actually make the profits right you can actually make the profits right you can see< see down here so if you are slightly you see down here so if you are slightly you know< know more bullish you don't think the know more bullish you don't think the market< market is going to go all the way down market is going to go all the way down down< down here this is where you can shift down here this is where you can shift your< your short strikes further up right so your short strikes further up right so of< of course if you shift the short strikes of course if you shift the short strikes up< up your two put strikes up you will up your two put strikes up you will notice< notice that your win rate is going to notice that your win rate is going to drop< drop as well so for this put broken wing drop as well so for this put broken wing butterfly< butterfly how you want to really profit butterfly how you want to really profit is< is in this tense Zone down here right is in this tense Zone down here right and< and if you think about it let me just and if you think about it let me just remove< remove this it does look a little bit remove this it does look a little bit like< like a home don't you think right like a like a home don't you think right like a house< house all right so imagine this is a a house all right so imagine this is a a very< very triangular shaped house you have very triangular shaped house you have your< your windows down here and then you have your windows down here and then you have a< a door down here which looks like some a door down here which looks like some kind< kind of monster with eyes and mouth kind of monster with eyes and mouth right< right but basically you want the market right but basically you want the market to< to actually come in somewhere down here to actually come in somewhere down here right< right so if a house down here this is right so if a house down here this is where< where you have the big biggest profit where you have the big biggest profit the< the chance of the biggest profit and the chance of the biggest profit and also< also this is one of the reasons why I also this is one of the reasons why I want< want to hold to expiration because this want to hold to expiration because this is< is a very slow spread a very slow spread is a very slow spread a very slow spread just< just means that you can see that this. just means that you can see that this purple< purple line down here purple line down here right< right you can see this purple line and right you can see this purple line and then< then you can see this green line okay so then you can see this green line okay so basically< basically the green line is how your p l basically the green line is how your p l will< will look like at expiration but the will look like at expiration but the purple< purple line is how it will look like at purple line is how it will look like at the< the moment where you place the trade on the moment where you place the trade on so< so at the moment when you place the so at the moment when you place the trade< trade on if the market goes down yes trade on if the market goes down yes you're< you're going to see some loss right you're going to see some loss right basically< basically because Theta hasn't kicked in basically because Theta hasn't kicked in you< you haven't given time for your option you haven't given time for your option trade< trade this put broken wing butterfly to trade this put broken wing butterfly to really< really nurture the profit over time you really nurture the profit over time you will< will see this purple line slowly go up will see this purple line slowly go up here< here to fit to this green line down here here to fit to this green line down here at< at the same time on the outside this at the same time on the outside this purple< purple line will go down to the green purple line will go down to the green line< line down here which also means that you line down here which also means that you tend< tend to lose more closer to the tend to lose more closer to the expression< expression if the market really goes expression if the market really goes down< down all the way past this break-even down all the way past this break-even point< point so that is why if you want to be point so that is why if you want to be safe< safe you want to try and construct your safe you want to try and construct your tent< tent somewhere just past this do you see tent somewhere just past this do you see this< this line down here this Gray Line This this line down here this Gray Line This Gray< Gray Line down here is what you call the Gray Line down here is what you call the one< one standard deviation line which is one standard deviation line which is where< where there's a larger probability that where there's a larger probability that the< the market will stay within this range the market will stay within this range most< most of the time right roughly about 68 most of the time right roughly about 68 percent< percent of time percent of time around< around there that is where the market uh around there that is where the market uh will< will be and that is why this is how you will be and that is why this is how you can< can choose to construct where your tent can choose to construct where your tent is< is if you're slightly more conservative is if you're slightly more conservative your< your tent you can construct it more your tent you can construct it more outside< outside here if you're slightly more outside here if you're slightly more aggressive< aggressive then you can put your tent aggressive then you can put your tent somewhere< somewhere inside this Zone down here somewhere inside this Zone down here again< again you can see it's very versatile again you can see it's very versatile it's< it's up to you to decide right so why do it's up to you to decide right so why do we< we want to do this on the cash settle we want to do this on the cash settle

com blueprint or right optionswithdavis. com blueprint or right back< back to the video by the way there are back to the video by the way there are quite< quite a few cash Shadow index options quite a few cash Shadow index options these< these are the main ones this is the m these are the main ones this is the m Rod< Rod which is the mini rut mini rut index Rod which is the mini rut mini rut index options< options XSP is the mini SPX options then options XSP is the mini SPX options then you< you have the SPX for the full size one you have the SPX for the full size one and< and the right so if you have a pretty and the right so if you have a pretty big< big size account multiple six figures big size account multiple six figures then< then you'll be going for the SPX and the then you'll be going for the SPX and the run< run if you have a much smaller account run if you have a much smaller account then< then you might want to go for this two then you might want to go for this two first< first until you've gained more first until you've gained more confidence< confidence you've got more Capital then confidence you've got more Capital then you< you go for the bigger size once so why you go for the bigger size once so why only< only the cash Center index option so the only the cash Center index option so the very< very first reason is because remember we very first reason is because remember we want< want to design a passive income strategy want to design a passive income strategy so< so passive income just means you want to so passive income just means you want to do< do the work once leave it and then you do the work once leave it and then you wait< wait for the income to come right so no wait for the income to come right so no point< point for you to put the strategy on and point for you to put the strategy on and then< then you always have to monitor it every then you always have to monitor it every single< single day you know adjust it leave that single day you know adjust it leave that for< for the other option strategies if you for the other option strategies if you want< want something that is very passive this want something that is very passive this is< is I believe the most passive that you is I believe the most passive that you can< can get right you just put it on once can get right you just put it on once leave< leave it to expiration see whether it's leave it to expiration see whether it's a< a profit or a loss and most of the time a profit or a loss and most of the time it's< it's going to be a profit because this it's going to be a profit because this has< has a very high win rate now next it has a very high win rate now next it takes< takes advantage of the positive drift so takes advantage of the positive drift so I've< I've mentioned this in quite a number of I've mentioned this in quite a number of my< my videos as well so one is the positive my videos as well so one is the positive drift< drift well the positive if drift is drift well the positive if drift is basically< basically that the market wants to go up basically that the market wants to go up over< over time right especially we are over time right especially we are putting< putting this on the index which is just putting this on the index which is just a< a basket of stocks as you can see the a basket of stocks as you can see the spiders< spiders the iwm all this index ETFs spiders the iwm all this index ETFs right< right or index in general basically go right or index in general basically go up< up over the long term if you look at the up over the long term if you look at the price< price like 20 years ago 30 years ago price like 20 years ago 30 years ago you'll< you'll notice that the price is so much you'll notice that the price is so much lower< lower so when you use the put broken lower so when you use the put broken. wing< wing butterfly you're actually taking wing butterfly you're actually taking advantage< advantage of the fact that the market advantage of the fact that the market wants< wants to go up and because there's no wants to go up and because there's no risk< risk to the upside you're pretty safe risk to the upside you're pretty safe there< there right once in a while there's there right once in a while there's going< going to be a crash which can actually going to be a crash which can actually be< be good for your put programming be good for your put programming butterfly< butterfly because you can design it so butterfly because you can design it so whereby< whereby you know when the crash Comes whereby you know when the crash Comes This< This is where your tent is this is where This is where your tent is this is where your< your you know Max profit zone is going your you know Max profit zone is going to< to be okay so it takes advantage of the to be okay so it takes advantage of the positive< positive drift now next is that it takes positive drift now next is that it takes advantage< advantage of the put skill so what is advantage of the put skill so what is the< the put skill so I've also mentioned the put skill so I've also mentioned this< this quite a number of times but this quite a number of times but basically< basically the puts you is that where you basically the puts you is that where you know< know you have a skewer and you put your know you have a skewer and you put your put< put options on a skewer right you have a put options on a skewer right you have a put< put option here more put options here put option here more put options here even< even more put options here you put it on even more put options here you put it on a< a skewer you get a put skill a skewer you get a put skill I'm< I'm kidding guys this is not a put skill I'm kidding guys this is not a put skill the< the put skill is whereby the lower the put skill is whereby the lower strikes< strikes have a higher implied volatility strikes have a higher implied volatility basically< basically what it means is that you're basically what it means is that you're going< going to get a higher premium as the going to get a higher premium as the strike< strike goes down which is very good for strike goes down which is very good for our< our put broken wing butterfly because our put broken wing butterfly because what< what you will notice is that when you what you will notice is that when you construct< construct the put broken wing butterfly construct the put broken wing butterfly compared< compared to the car broken wing compared to the car broken wing butterfly butterfly butterfly basically< basically called Brooklyn butterfly will basically called Brooklyn butterfly will be< be on the upside so it will be on the be on the upside so it will be on the opposite< opposite side of the put programming opposite side of the put programming butterfly< butterfly you will notice that your tent butterfly you will notice that your tent all< all right let me just bring back to this all right let me just bring back to this p< p l down here so you notice that your p l down here so you notice that your tent< tent is going to be much smaller for the tent is going to be much smaller for the call< call side so the calls back side will call side so the calls back side will look< look the opposite of this right so look the opposite of this right so basically< basically call side will be like this basically call side will be like this okay< okay so this is where your p l graph okay so this is where your p l graph will< will be so this is normally where the will be so this is normally where the market< market price will be all right so what market price will be all right so what is< is trying to take advantage of is if the is trying to take advantage of is if the market< market goes up you try to capture it in market goes up you try to capture it in this< this 10.

but the problem with this is this 10. but the problem with this is that< that because of the puts queue you can't that because of the puts queue you can't get< get as big of a tent as the put side get as big of a tent as the put side right< right so maybe for the put side if you right so maybe for the put side if you were< were to use the exact same Deltas maybe were to use the exact same Deltas maybe this< this could be a Max of maybe let's say a this could be a Max of maybe let's say a thousand< thousand dollars all right let's just thousand dollars all right let's just say< say a thousand dollars if you were to do say a thousand dollars if you were to do the< the same Delta on the call side chances the same Delta on the call side chances are< are that you're going to get much lesser are that you're going to get much lesser right< right so maybe as an example is probably right so maybe as an example is probably only< only going to be 500 and your Zone your only going to be 500 and your Zone your profit< profit zone is going to be smaller as profit zone is going to be smaller as well< well compared to the put broken wing well compared to the put broken wing butterfly< butterfly so that is one why we don't butterfly so that is one why we don't generally< generally use the call broken ring generally use the call broken ring butterfly< butterfly on this index options now next butterfly on this index options now next there< there is no early assignment now this is there is no early assignment now this is very< very important because you do not want very important because you do not want to< to put on a position and if it's in the to put on a position and if it's in the money< money somehow you're going to get money somehow you're going to get assigned< assigned where you're going to be long assigned where you're going to be long some< some shares short some shares and that's some shares short some shares and that's going< going to destroy all you know your going to destroy all you know your trading< trading efforts right because you're trading efforts right because you're going< going to get so confused and you're going to get so confused and you're going< going to worry about a margin call so going to worry about a margin call so because< because the index options they are because the index options they are operating< operating on the European style which operating on the European style which only< only means that there can only be only means that there can only be assignment< assignment or exercise upon expiration assignment or exercise upon expiration all< all right so the European style is much all right so the European style is much more< more tame compared to the ones that more tame compared to the ones that you're< you're normally used to which is called you're normally used to which is called the< the American style right the American the American style right the American styles< styles are the ones where you find on styles are the ones where you find on all< all your Equity options in fact also on all your Equity options in fact also on your< your index ETFs as well so the American your index ETFs as well so the American style< style options you can exercise at any style options you can exercise at any time< time so if you're in the money you might time so if you're in the money you might find< find sometimes right that you could be find sometimes right that you could be assigned< assigned early on it and that's where assigned early on it and that's where the< the travel comes so the the American the travel comes so the the American style< style is slightly much more wild style is slightly much more wild compared< compared to the European style right the compared to the European style right the American< American style is almost like um like a American style is almost like um like a Gangnam< Gangnam Style Gangnam Style and< and also there is no assignment of and also there is no assignment of shares< shares right so it's very linked to this shares right so it's very linked to this but< but because this is the index. option but because this is the index option this< this is Cash settle you will only be this is Cash settle you will only be realizing< realizing either a profit or a loss in realizing either a profit or a loss in terms< terms of your money so it will either be terms of your money so it will either be you< you know you will see a profit into your you know you will see a profit into your account< account or a loss from your account now account or a loss from your account now this< this is a very frequent question that I this is a very frequent question that I get< get whenever I share about any options get whenever I share about any options strategies< strategies on my channel is that Davis strategies on my channel is that Davis can< can we do this on the weekly options or can we do this on the weekly options or can< can we do this the zero DTE options I can we do this the zero DTE options I like< like to make money every single day I like to make money every single day I want< want to see money into my account every want to see money into my account every single< single day I like it wild I like the single day I like it wild I like the Gangnam< Gangnam Style Gangnam Style well< well the answer is technically yes you well the answer is technically yes you can< can put it on right on the Zero TT the can put it on right on the Zero TT the weekly< weekly options whatever you know rocks weekly options whatever you know rocks your< your boat well because the exchange your boat well because the exchange actually< actually doesn't restrict you from actually doesn't restrict you from choosing< choosing which DTE you want to place the choosing which DTE you want to place the strategy< strategy on so if you ask me can you do strategy on so if you ask me can you do this< this yes you can do it on any time frame this yes you can do it on any time frame which< which you want but the more important which you want but the more important question< question to ask is is there a question to ask is is there a statistical< statistical Edge well I'm going to show statistical Edge well I'm going to show you< you this and you tell me right so first you this and you tell me right so first of< of all our statistical Edge is whereby of all our statistical Edge is whereby the< the IV is greater than the RV which the IV is greater than the RV which means< means to say most of the time the means to say most of the time the implied< implied volatility or rather this range implied volatility or rather this range down< down here this one standard deviation down here this one standard deviation range< range the market actually tends to be range the market actually tends to be you< you know staying within here most of the you know staying within here most of the time< time that is how we are able to you know time that is how we are able to you know make< make money from the expected move make money from the expected move especially< especially we are trading this out of a especially we are trading this out of a short< short option strategies where we want short option strategies where we want the< the market to stay in a certain range so the market to stay in a certain range so especially< especially if you have this broken wing especially if you have this broken wing butterfly< butterfly down here you can see we do butterfly down here you can see we do want< want it to stay inside this range more want it to stay inside this range more often< often than not right that's how we're often than not right that's how we're going< going to profit on this strategy now if going to profit on this strategy now if you< you were to take a look at this table you were to take a look at this table down< down here so you can see this is a very down here so you can see this is a very significant< significant data set this has been done significant data set this has been done since< since 1993.

so this is a comparison since 1993. so this is a comparison where< where the uh it takes the expected range where the uh it takes the expected range versus< versus the realized move so basically versus the realized move so basically it's< it's the expected is the IV depicted by it's the expected is the IV depicted by the< the IV the RV right realized move the IV the RV right realized move depicted< depicted by the RV so as you can see depicted by the RV so as you can see anything< anything that is below 45 days right anything that is below 45 days right from< from seven days all the way to 30 days from seven days all the way to 30 days you< you can see that the RV you can see that the RV the< the expected move is actually not bigger the expected move is actually not bigger than< than the realized move right you can see than the realized move right you can see expected< expected bigger than realize no only expected bigger than realize no only where< where the 45 days is the expected move where the 45 days is the expected move is< is bigger than the realized buff you can is bigger than the realized buff you can see< see that which means to say this uh IV see that which means to say this uh IV down< down here this bigger one is always down here this bigger one is always bigger< bigger than where the market is actually bigger than where the market is actually going< going to go and that's what we want when going to go and that's what we want when we< we put on this short option strategies we put on this short option strategies so< so you can see as well right if it's 45 so you can see as well right if it's 45 days< days it's yes right expected move is days it's yes right expected move is bigger< bigger 60 days is bigger 90 days is bigger 60 days is bigger 90 days is bigger< bigger so you tell me right you want to bigger so you tell me right you want to put< put it on the seven days is it going to put it on the seven days is it going to have< have some sort of a statistical Edge have some sort of a statistical Edge right< right this is something you may want to right this is something you may want to find< find out of yourself but I lean on the find out of yourself but I lean on the data< data so that is why I tend to go more data so that is why I tend to go more for< for the longer term ones so anywhere for the longer term ones so anywhere from< from 45 to 65 okay from 45 to 65 okay now< now let's talk about risks so risk is now let's talk about risks so risk is something< something very important because we something very important because we always< always look at how much money we can always look at how much money we can make< make most of the time that's what we are make most of the time that's what we are tuned< tuned to our eyes our mind we just want tuned to our eyes our mind we just want to< to see how much we make but many times to see how much we make but many times we< we forget that there are risks in the we forget that there are risks in the trade< trade so are there risks in the broken trade so are there risks in the broken wing< wing butterfly and the answer is of wing butterfly and the answer is of course< course yes so as you can see down here course yes so as you can see down here your< your house down here this tent is on a your house down here this tent is on a cliff< cliff right you can see this is the cliff right you can see this is the cliff< cliff so if you know your tenants let's cliff so if you know your tenants let's say< say if they're coming down here they say if they're coming down here they stay< stay in the house make sure that they stay in the house make sure that they always< always stay in the house or you know always stay in the house or you know just< just play in the front yard but tell just play in the front yard but tell them< them not to open the back door down here them not to open the back door down here past< past this red door down here put the past this red door down here put the door< door in Red so they know that they door in Red so they know that they should< should not exit there because if they do should not exit there because if they do man< man they're going to be in for a very man they're going to be in for a very nice< nice ride and by that I mean you are nice ride and by that I mean you are going< going to be in for a world of pain going to be in for a world of pain because< because you're gonna start to lose money because you're gonna start to lose money so< so you need to understand that there are so you need to understand that there are risks< risks in this strategy as well so as risks in this strategy as well so as with< with many passive income strategies with many passive income strategies there's< there's always risk right even rental there's always risk right even rental income< income right you have risk when you want income right you have risk when you want to< to find the property you want to find to find the property you want to find the< the tenant you do up you know the place the tenant you do up you know the place there's< there's all costs involved and I can there's all costs involved and I can tell< tell you is a hassle because I've tell you is a hassle because I've experience< experience in the area I've rented a experience in the area I've rented a property< property and I'm telling you it's not as property and I'm telling you it's not as fun< fun as what the books or what people fun as what the books or what people tell< tell you it is and I can tell you tell you it is and I can tell you options< options trade is so much easier just put options trade. is so much easier just put on< on the trade you don't have to worry on the trade you don't have to worry about< about too many things about too many things all< all right compared to rental income or all right compared to rental income or even< even in dividend stocks right different even in dividend stocks right different stocks< stocks there's also the risk whereby you stocks there's also the risk whereby you put< put into the dividend company right you put into the dividend company right you buy< buy the company and the stock can just buy the company and the stock can just plunge< plunge overnight right some adverse news plunge overnight right some adverse news that's< that's going to cause it to crash so that's going to cause it to crash so there's< there's always risk so for the put there's always risk so for the put broken< broken wing butterfly is the same as broken wing butterfly is the same as well< well but there are ways to reduce the well but there are ways to reduce the risk risk risk all< all right so similarly with option all right so similarly with option strategies< strategies there's always risk so strategies there's always risk so although< although this strategy has a very high although this strategy has a very high win< win rate as you can see down here it's win rate as you can see down here it's also< also very important to exercise proper also very important to exercise proper risk< risk management so proper risk risk management so proper risk management< management just means you'd want to have management just means you'd want to have proper< proper Capital allocation make sure you proper Capital allocation make sure you allocate< allocate no more than five percent to allocate no more than five percent to seven< seven percent or Max 10 right if you you seven percent or Max 10 right if you you think< think that you're not going to have that think that you're not going to have that many< many trades right if you're not going to many trades right if you're not going to have< have many trades you're the kind where have many trades you're the kind where you< you you like to put on a bigger portion you you like to put on a bigger portion of< of your account and hold on to the trade of your account and hold on to the trade until< until it works out or not then you put until it works out or not then you put on< on the next trade yep you can allocate on the next trade yep you can allocate up< up to maybe 10 but I would say that's up to maybe 10 but I would say that's the< the max you would go best stick the max you would go best stick somewhere< somewhere between five to seven percent somewhere between five to seven percent and< and you also want to have proper and you also want to have proper position< position sizing right you do not want to position sizing right you do not want to see< see what kind of credit you get down see what kind of credit you get down here< here and then base your sizing based on here and then base your sizing based on the< the credit so let's say for example if the credit so let's say for example if you< you get a hundred bucks for every put you get a hundred bucks for every put broken< broken wing butterfly you put on you broken wing butterfly you put on you don't< don't want to say all right I want to don't want to say all right I want to make< make a thousand dollars for this trade make a thousand dollars for this trade so< so you're gonna put on 10 broken wing so you're gonna put on 10 broken wing butterfly< butterfly no that's not what you want butterfly no that's not what you want because< because you need to understand that if because you need to understand that if you're< you're going to have 10 times the credit you're going to have 10 times the credit down< down here you're going to have 10 times down here you're going to have 10 times the< the risk down here as well so very the risk down here as well so very important< important for you to understand and last important for you to understand and last but< but not least put broken butterfly as we but not least put broken butterfly as we already< already know the risk is on the downside already know the risk is on the downside anything< anything to the upside no responsoever anything to the upside no responsoever downside< downside this is where we will start to downside this is where we will start to lose< lose some money so one way to circumvent lose some money so one way to circumvent this< this risk to reduce this risk even this risk to reduce this risk even further< further is to shift this short strike further is to shift this short strike down< down right the more you shift the short down right the more you shift the short strikes< strikes further out of the money then strikes further out of the money then this< this is going to lower your risk and this is going to lower your risk and lower< lower the chance that the market can lower the chance that the market can actually< actually get past your break-even point actually get past your break-even point all< all right guys so this is the put broken all right guys so this is the put broken wing< wing butterfly by the way if you like wing butterfly by the way if you like this< this video then you're absolutely going this video then you're absolutely going to< to love this next video which I have for to love this next video which I have for you< you so go ahead and watch that video you so go ahead and watch that video right<

=====================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty so in today's video all right alrighty so in today's video we're< we're going to be talking about the we're going to be talking about the complete< complete beginner's guide to Rolling complete beginner's guide to Rolling iron< iron Condors so in my previous video iron Condors so in my previous video I've< I've already talked about rolling credit I've already talked about rolling credit spreads< spreads and if you haven't already spreads and if you haven't already watched< watched that video just go ahead to my watched that video just go ahead to my channel< channel and look for Rolling credit channel and look for Rolling credit spreads< spreads so for this video we're going to spreads so for this video we're going to be< be talking about rolling iron Condors be talking about rolling iron Condors which< which is going to be slightly more which is going to be slightly more complex< complex than rolling credit spreads complex than rolling credit spreads because< because this time iron Condors as you because this time iron Condors as you know< know is two credit spreads combined all know is two credit spreads combined all right< right so first off what exactly is right so first off what exactly is rolling< rolling so rolling is the simultaneous rolling so rolling is the simultaneous process< process of closing your existing trade process of closing your existing trade and< and then opening a new trade and then and then opening a new trade and then you< you want to do this for an overall net you want to do this for an overall net Credit< Credit in a single order right so Credit in a single order right so there's< there's quite a bit to take in down here there's quite a bit to take in down here but< but the important thing is that you want but the important thing is that you want to< to have an overall net credit that's to have an overall net credit that's because< because when you have an overall net because when you have an overall net credit< credit when you roll what you're credit when you roll what you're essentially< essentially doing is that you're essentially doing is that you're increasing< increasing the max profit and you are increasing the max profit and you are decreasing< decreasing your max loss right but if decreasing your max loss right but if you< you were to rule for a net debit then you were to rule for a net debit then what< what you have done is you have reversed what you have done is you have reversed it< it right instead of increasing your max it right instead of increasing your max profit< profit what you've done is you have profit what you've done is you have decreased< decreased your max profit and you have decreased your max profit and you have increased< increased your max loss so you do not increased your max loss so you do not want< want to roll for a debit right most of want to roll for a debit right most of the< the time you want to vote for a credit the time you want to vote for a credit so< so how do you want to roll it so as you so how do you want to roll it so as you can< can see down here this is the original can see down here this is the original trade< trade for the put side so let's say it's trade for the put side so let's say it's trading< trading at a dollar and 12 cents right trading at a dollar and 12 cents right now< now so to roll this what you want to do now so to roll this what you want to do is< is you want to buy back the original is you want to buy back the original spread< spread so as you can see down here you spread so as you can see down here you buy< buy it back and then you sell the longer buy it back and then you sell the longer days< days to expiration put spread right so days to expiration put spread right so you< you can see this is 16 June which is you can see this is 16 June which is roughly< roughly about a month out from where you roughly about a month out from where you initially< initially place your credit spread for initially place your credit spread for the< the put side right so if you want to the put side right so if you want to roll< roll the call sign it will be the same roll the call sign it will be the same as< as well now unlike credit spreads there as well now unlike credit spreads there are< are a few ways to roll iron Condors are a few ways to roll iron Condors right< right you could just roll the shot put right you could just roll the shot put spread< spread out all right you do this in one spread out all right you do this in one single< single order or you could just roll the single order or you could just roll the shot< shot call spread out or you could just shot call spread out or you could just roll< roll both sides right if you want to roll both sides right if you want to roll< roll both sides then you get the credit roll both sides then you get the credit for< for both sides so the thing is that when for both sides so the thing is that when you< you are rolling iron Condors as well as you are rolling iron Condors as well as rolling< rolling credit spreads it's not all the rolling credit spreads it's not all the time< time that you can get a credit because time that you can get a credit because there< there are times when the market goes there are times when the market goes deep< deep in the money uh chances that it's deep in the money uh chances that it's going< going to be a debit so when you are going to be a debit so when you are rolling< rolling it you want to just keep in mind rolling it you want to just keep in mind about< about this right so about this right so the< the next question is how and when to the next question is how and when to roll< roll right so when you are talking about roll right so when you are talking about iron< iron Condors the first thing you want to iron Condors the first thing you want to think< think about is you know where is your think about is you know where is your profit< profit Zone where is the part that you profit Zone where is the part that you are< are going to make money so once you have are going to make money so once you have established< established that then you know whether established that then you know whether you< you want to roll or not right so for an you want to roll or not right so for an iron< iron Condor it's very straightforward we iron Condor it's very straightforward we know< know that the profit zone is within this know that the profit zone is within this short< short strikes all right from here to short strikes all right from here to here< here this is where you will be able to here this is where you will be able to get< get your max profit right and then now get your max profit right and then now we< we want to identify where's the point we want to identify where's the point that< that you will start to lose money for that you will start to lose money for your< your iron condor your iron condor so< so you can see down here I have this so you can see down here I have this orange< orange color uh coated part down here so orange color uh coated part down here so this< this orange or yellow coated part down this orange or yellow coated part down here< here is basically where your profits here is basically where your profits will< will start to diminish to the point will start to diminish to the point where< where it becomes a break-even point so where it becomes a break-even point so down< down here would be where you pretty much down here would be where you pretty much don't< don't make anything so this is the zero don't make anything so this is the zero dollar< dollar mark down here and anything below dollar mark down here and anything below the< the zero Mark and on the top side the zero Mark and on the top side anything< anything above the zero point that is anything above the zero point that is where< where you start to lose money right so where you start to lose money right so to< to make things simple we just only want to make things simple we just only want to< to look at the part where it's in within to look at the part where it's in within this< this you know short strikes because this this you know short strikes because this is< is the point whereby it's the most is the point whereby it's the most safest< safest in a sense because if the market safest in a sense because if the market was< was to go all the way past down here was to go all the way past down here let's< let's say it's still at the break-even let's say it's still at the break-even point< point the thing is now your core strike point the thing is now your core strike has< has been breached which means to say has been breached which means to say there's< there's a chance that you could get there's a chance that you could get early< early assigned so as much as possible we early assigned so as much as possible we do< do not want that to happen so when do do not want that to happen so when do you< you roll with this in mind you can you roll with this in mind you can consider< consider rolling when either the short consider rolling when either the short strikes< strikes get tested right as I mentioned strikes get tested right as I mentioned and< and there's less than 21 DTE and the the and there's less than 21 DTE and the the reason< reason for this is that when there's reason for this is that when there's less< less than 21 days to expiration the less than 21 days to expiration the extrinsic< extrinsic value tend to be much lesser extrinsic value tend to be much lesser right< right you're going to have very little right you're going to have very little extrinsic< extrinsic value in your short options extrinsic value in your short options right< right in your short call and in your right in your short call and in your shot< shot put so when there's very little shot put so when there's very little extrinsic< extrinsic value and the market is in the extrinsic value and the market is in the money< money right let's say it's in the money money right let's say it's in the money on< on either sides right on either sides right either< either the shot put or the short call either the shot put or. the short call side< side then chances are you could be early side then chances are you could be early assigned< assigned when the extrinsic value drops assigned when the extrinsic value drops to< to a very little so that is why we want to a very little so that is why we want to< to ensure that there's more than 21 to ensure that there's more than 21 digital< digital expression because if they're digital expression because if they're smaller< smaller than 21 days of expiration then smaller than 21 days of expiration then there's< there's still quite a bit of extrinsic there's still quite a bit of extrinsic value< value left remember extrinsic value is value left remember extrinsic value is just< just time value right so there's more just time value right so there's more time< time in it there tends to be more time in it there tends to be more extrinsic< extrinsic value and that reduces your extrinsic value and that reduces your chance< chance of getting early assignment even chance of getting early assignment even though< though it's in the money right so we though it's in the money right so we want< want to use this as a gauge Which is want to use this as a gauge Which is less< less than 21 days to expression and last less than 21 days to expression and last but< but not least is that you want to be but not least is that you want to be able< able to get a net credit because if you able to get a net credit because if you don't< don't get a net credit like I mentioned don't get a net credit like I mentioned then< then you're going to be decreasing your then you're going to be decreasing your max< max profit increasing your max loss all max profit increasing your max loss all right< right so now we will go through the right so now we will go through the different< different scenarios that you might face different scenarios that you might face and< and then for each one we will see and then for each one we will see whether< whether we should roll and how we should whether we should roll and how we should roll< roll them if we want to okay so for the roll them if we want to okay so for the first< first scenario is if the market is first scenario is if the market is within< within the short strikes and there's within the short strikes and there's more< more than 21 days to expiration but your more than 21 days to expiration but your iron< iron control is in a loss right although iron control is in a loss right although it's< it's within your short strikes you will it's within your short strikes you will notice< notice that it could be in a loss so in notice that it could be in a loss so in this< this scenario there is no need to roll this scenario there is no need to roll right< right your short strikes have not been right your short strikes have not been breached< breached so the iron Condor is still breached so the iron Condor is still working< working well at this point so what I'll working well at this point so what I'll do< do is basically just do nothing and let do is basically just do nothing and let the< the trade work out right let Theta just the trade work out right let Theta just work< work for you over time and slowly you work for you over time and slowly you will< will see that as long as it stays within will see that as long as it stays within the< the strikes your p l will slowly start the strikes your p l will slowly start to< to increase now scenario number two the to increase now scenario number two the market< market is within the short strikes same market is within the short strikes same thing< thing but this time there's less than 21 thing but this time there's less than 21 days< days to expiration and your iron Condor days to expiration and your iron Condor is< is in a loss as well so in this case is in a loss as well so in this case what< what do you do should you roll what do you do should you roll well< well the answer is that it's actually well the answer is that it's actually not< not necessary to roll well because the not necessary to roll well because the short< short strikes have not been breached short strikes have not been breached because< because we have identified that remember because we have identified that remember between< between these two short strikes it's between these two short strikes it's still< still in a profit which means to say if still in a profit which means to say if time< time goes by it still stays there your time goes by it still stays there your temporary< temporary loss will slowly become a temporary loss will slowly become a profit< profit right because this is the profit profit right because this is the profit zone< zone is well inside the profit zone so I zone is well inside the profit zone so I would< would do nothing let the trade work out would do nothing let the trade work out but< but since it's less than 21 days to but since it's less than 21 days to expiration< expiration you want to be prepared to expiration you want to be prepared to roll< roll once the short strike has been roll once the short strike has been breached< breached so if it touches this put breached so if it touches this put strike< strike in the next few days then this is strike in the next few days then this is time< time where you want to be on alert and time where you want to be on alert and start< start to consider rolling your iron start to consider rolling your iron Condor< Condor now if you want to reduce your Condor now if you want to reduce your risk< risk you can actually roll as well even risk you can actually roll as well even though< though you know it's still within your though you know it's still within your short< short strike so I've seen a few people short strike so I've seen a few people that< that have done this and when you rolled that have done this and when you rolled it< it this way you will almost always it this way you will almost always ensure< ensure that it's going to be for a ensure that it's going to be for a credit< credit right because the price is well credit right because the price is well within< within your short strikes it has not within your short strikes it has not touched< touched your short strikes it's not touched your short strikes it's not reached< reached it so there's no chance for it reached it so there's no chance for it to< to become a a debit row so this will to become a a debit row so this will almost< almost always be a credit role so that almost always be a credit role so that is< is why some people want to use this an is why some people want to use this an opportunity< opportunity to increase their Max profit opportunity to increase their Max profit and< and then decrease their maximum loss so and then decrease their maximum loss so in< in this case by Rolling both sides out in this case by Rolling both sides out which< which means to say you roll to the next which means to say you roll to the next nearest< nearest maybe 45 to 60 days to nearest maybe 45 to 60 days to expiration< expiration you will very likely get a expiration you will very likely get a net< net credit since both sides are out of net credit since both sides are out of money< money you can also consider rolling the money you can also consider rolling the call< call side out and down which means to call side out and down which means to say say say you< you could roll it down maybe let's say you could roll it down maybe let's say you< you want to roll it to four one zero you want to roll it to four one zero four< four one five so this way not only do four one five so this way not only do you< you get a credit for rolling out you you get a credit for rolling out you also< also get more credit by rolling down also get more credit by rolling down because< because it's now closer to at the money because it's now closer to at the money is< is closer to where the current market is is closer to where the current market is so< so anytime when you roll it closer to so anytime when you roll it closer to the< the market you're going to be able to the market you're going to be able to get< get more credit right but take in mind get more credit right but take in mind that< that when you roll this down what you're that when you roll this down what you're actually< actually doing is also reducing your actually doing is also reducing your probability< probability of profit because remember probability of profit because remember when< when you first started out this is your when you first started out this is your profit< profit zone right your profit zone is profit zone right your profit zone is pretty< pretty big right but when you roll it pretty big right but when you roll it down< down suddenly now your profit Zone has down suddenly now your profit Zone has been< been squeezed from here to here so true been squeezed from here to here so true you< you get more credit but you are being you get more credit but you are being compensated< compensated because now you have a compensated because now you have a reduced< reduced probability of profit your win reduced probability of profit your win rate< rate is going to be slightly lower rate is going to be slightly lower because< because your profit zone is going to be because your profit zone is going to be slightly< slightly smaller so this is one thing slightly smaller so this is one thing you< you have to keep in mind by the way if you have to keep in mind by the way if you< you like this video so far Please you like this video so far

com blueprint or< or right back to the video now the next or right back to the video now the next scenario< scenario is if the market has just scenario is if the market has just breached< breached the shot put strike and there's breached the shot put strike and there's less< less than 21 days to expiration so less than 21 days to expiration so basically< basically this is what I mentioned early basically this is what I mentioned early on< on so what do you do so this is point on so what do you do so this is point where< where you want to roll so how do you where you want to roll so how do you roll< roll this so there are a few ways to roll this so there are a few ways to roll< roll this so the first is that you can roll this so the first is that you can roll< roll the shot put spread out so at this roll the shot put spread out so at this point< point again because it has just touched point again because it has just touched your< your shot put strike chances are that your shot put strike chances are that you< you are going to get a credit right you are going to get a credit right you're< you're going to get a positive credit to you're going to get a positive credit to roll< roll this put side then at this point roll this put side then at this point what< what you could consider is that you what you could consider is that you could< could also roll your short call spread could also roll your short call spread out< out then you keep the same strike right out then you keep the same strike right so< so if you roll this out chances are so if you roll this out chances are you'll< you'll get a credit but not that much you'll get a credit but not that much okay okay okay or< or you could roll the short call spread or you could roll the short call spread out< out and down like I mentioned you can out and down like I mentioned you can roll< roll it down here to four one zero four roll it down here to four one zero four one< one five or if you're not that one five or if you're not that aggressive< aggressive maybe you can roll it down to aggressive maybe you can roll it down to four< four one five four two zero and just four one five four two zero and just take< take a look at the kind of credit which take a look at the kind of credit which you< you get remember if you roll it down you get remember if you roll it down further< further you get more credit all right further you get more credit all right let's< let's say this many dollar sign means let's say this many dollar sign means you< you becoming more richer okay so you get you becoming more richer okay so you get more< more credit but then you reduce your more credit but then you reduce your profit< profit zone so that means your win rate profit zone so that means your win rate actually< actually goes down right your win rate actually goes down right your win rate actually< actually goes down but if you roll it actually goes down but if you roll it just< just to the 415 which is not so close to just to the 415 which is not so close to the< the the market price then what happens the the market price then what happens is< is that you will rule for credit as well is that you will rule for credit as well but< but maybe you won't get that much right but maybe you won't get that much right maybe< maybe just two dollar signs but this way maybe just two dollar signs but this way at< at least you have a larger profit Zone at least you have a larger profit Zone but< but of course if you just want to roll but of course if you just want to roll out< out to the same strikes then you know out to the same strikes then you know you'll< you'll still get a credit but it's just you'll still get a credit but it's just you< you know one one dollar sign for you you know one one dollar sign for you down< down here but you remain your profit uh down here but you remain your profit uh win< win rate down here right your win rate win rate down here right your win rate is< is still going to be the same so there's is still going to be the same so there's going< going to be a trade-off for each one or going to be a trade-off for each one or alternatively< alternatively you could just simply just alternatively you could just simply just close< close out your call spread and then you close out your call spread and then you do< do not have to worry on the top side so do not have to worry on the top side so even< even though if the Market's only bounced even though if the Market's only bounced up< up and ready all the way to the Moon up and ready all the way to the Moon there's< there's no need for you to be afraid there's no need for you to be afraid because< because you have no longer a call spread because you have no longer a call spread down< down here right all you have is just the down here right all you have is just the short< short put spread and this shot put short put spread and this shot put spread< spread as the market release is going to spread as the market release is going to be< be in a profit all right so these are be in a profit all right so these are the< the three ways that you can roll it out the three ways that you can roll it out for< for the scenario now scenario number for the scenario now scenario number four< four the market has just tested the shot four the market has just tested the shot put< put strike and there's more than 21 days put strike and there's more than 21 days to< to expiration so what do you do do you to expiration so what do you do do you roll< roll it or do you just do nothing roll it or do you just do nothing well< well in this case I'm more inclined to well in this case I'm more inclined to do< do nothing it's not necessary to roll do nothing it's not necessary to roll but< but you can roll if you want and the but you can roll if you want and the reason< reason why I feel that you know it's not reason why I feel that you know it's not really< really necessary to grow because there's really necessary to grow because there's still< still more than 21 days of expression so still more than 21 days of expression so for< for example if you put on this trade at for example if you put on this trade at 45< 45 and all of a sudden next day for some 45 and all of a sudden next day for some reason< reason you know the market just tanked reason you know the market just tanked so< so what's going to happen right maybe so what's going to happen right maybe one< one day has gone past it becomes 44 days one day has gone past it becomes 44 days to< to expiration If You're Gonna Roll this to expiration If You're Gonna Roll this right< right now you may have to roll to the right now you may have to roll to the next< next expiration date which could be next expiration date which could be around< around 60 days so this will further around 60 days so this will further increase< increase the time in your trade and increase the time in your trade and Theta< Theta don't really kick in until it's Theta don't really kick in until it's much< much closer to expiration so at this much closer to expiration so at this point< point of time you know this it doesn't point of time you know this it doesn't really< really gain you a lot on a day-to-day really gain you a lot on a day-to-day basis< basis when you're starting from 60 days basis when you're starting from 60 days to< to expiration or even longer than that to expiration or even longer than that so< so basically I wouldn't say there is a so basically I wouldn't say there is a neat< neat rule so I can just do nothing let neat rule so I can just do nothing let the< the trade work out and since there's the trade work out and since there's still< still many days in the trade the market still many days in the trade the market can< can always go back up into the profit can always go back up into the profit Zone< Zone all right scenario number five now Zone all right scenario number five now the< the market has has gone far below your the market has has gone far below your shot< shot put strike and there's more than 21 shot put strike and there's more than 21 days< days to expression so what happens if days to expression so what happens if the< the market really tanked right or it may the market really tanked right or it may have< have really gone all the way up so I'm have really gone all the way up so I'm just< just doing this for the put science and just doing this for the put science and illustration< illustration but of course on the call illustration but of course on the call side< side it will just be the opposite so side it will just be the opposite so just< just try and imagine basically it'll be just try and imagine basically it'll be the< the same way you manage it whether it the same way you manage it whether it breaches< breaches the put side or the call side breaches the put side or the call side so< so in this example let's say the so in this example let's say the scenario< scenario number five it breaches the put scenario number five it breaches the put side< side and goes all the way deep in the side and goes all the way deep in the money< money right maybe even past your long money right maybe even past your long put< put strike in this case so what do you put strike in this case so what do you do< do do you actually roll do do you actually roll so< so in this case I would actually suggest so in this case I would actually suggest to< to do nothing because even though if you to do nothing because even though if you want< want to roll chances are that you want to roll chances are that you wouldn't< wouldn't be able to get a credit for wouldn't be able to get a credit for this< this right chances are it will be a this right chances are it will be a negative< negative uh it will be a debit for you negative uh it will be a debit for you to< to roll the put side because it has gone to roll the put side because it has gone so< so far in the money it will not be so far in the money it will not be possible< possible for you to get a credit at this possible for you to get a credit at this point< point so you could try the roll down the point so you could try the roll down the call< call side as well but then again the call side as well but then again the credit< credit which you receive here may not be credit which you receive here may not be more< more than the debit which you paid on more than the debit which you paid on the< the put side so it really depends but in the put side so it really depends but in this< this case because there's still more this case because there's still more than< than 21 days to expiration I just want than 21 days to expiration I just want to< to let the trade work out right it could to let the trade work out right it could just< just go back up again just go back up again and< and even if it doesn't remember this is and even if it doesn't remember this is an< an iron Condor trade it is not an an iron Condor trade it is not an undefined< undefined risk right undefined risk like undefined risk right undefined risk like for< for example the shot put or maybe the for example the shot put or maybe the strangle< strangle where there's no long put or strangle where there's no long put or the< the long call to cap your maximum risk the long call to cap your maximum risk at< at the point of time then you may find at the point of time then you may find it< it a little bit more risky because if it a little bit more risky because if the< the market really goes all the way down the market really goes all the way down all< all the way up you could lose a lot of all the way up you could lose a lot of money< money but this is the iron Condor the money but this is the iron Condor the iron< iron Condor has already an inbuilt stop iron Condor has already an inbuilt stop loss< loss in place so to speak right because loss in place so to speak right because you< you already kept the maximum risk to the you already kept the maximum risk to the width< width down here and this risk which you width down here and this risk which you first< first set at the start you should first set at the start you should already< already have accepted it that there is already have accepted it that there is always< always a possibility that you could lose always a possibility that you could lose the< the max amount with any trade that you the max amount with any trade that you put< put on so that is why this is where put on so that is why this is where Capital< Capital allocation comes in right one Capital allocation comes in right one part< part is to manage it the other part if part is to manage it the other part if you< you want to really be profitable in the you want to really be profitable in the long< long run then you need to be good with long run then you need to be good with your< your Capital allocation you want to make your Capital allocation you want to make sure< sure that you allocate not too big right sure that you allocate not too big right you< you don't want this to be like 25 of you don't want this to be. like 25 of your< your account and then you're going to be your account and then you're going to be very< very worried with each trade instead you very worried with each trade instead you should< should want to allocate maybe at most should want to allocate maybe at most five< five to seven percent depending on how five to seven percent depending on how big< big your account is if your account is big your account is if your account is much< much bigger you want to allocate lesser much bigger you want to allocate lesser than< than five percent so this way any single than five percent so this way any single trade< trade even though if it goes wrong hits trade even though if it goes wrong hits the< the max loss it's not going to affect the max loss it's not going to affect you< you that much right you've got many you that much right you've got many other< other trips to come and we know that as other trips to come and we know that as long< long as you stick to the guidelines the long as you stick to the guidelines the rules< rules you're going to be profitable in rules you're going to be profitable in the< the long run so that is why if it goes the long run so that is why if it goes all< all the way deep in the money there's all the way deep in the money there's still< still time left I'm just going to delay still time left I'm just going to delay it< it work out right the chances of getting it work out right the chances of getting an< an early assignment is still pretty low an early assignment is still pretty low because< because there's still more than 21 days because there's still more than 21 days to< to expiration which means there's still to expiration which means there's still quite< quite a bit of extrinsic value left now quite a bit of extrinsic value left now if< if you really want to roll this the if you really want to roll this the other< other way you could do is to roll it other way you could do is to roll it down< down into a butterfly that means it down into a butterfly that means it becomes< becomes a butterfly so what you want to becomes a butterfly so what you want to do< do is that you want to roll this all the do is that you want to roll this all the way< way to where the shot put strike is so way to where the shot put strike is so if< if you take a look at the p l graph for if you take a look at the p l graph for the< the butterfly it looks something like the butterfly it looks something like this< this right so as you can see down here this right so as you can see down here this< this is where in the center this is this is where in the center this is where< where your shot put and your short call where your shot put and your short call strikes< strikes are so the profit zone is going strikes are so the profit zone is going to< to be very small but in this way at to be very small but in this way at least< least you will definitely still get a least you will definitely still get a credit< credit so you'll be rolling for a credit credit so you'll be rolling for a credit you'll< you'll be increasing your max profit and you'll be increasing your max profit and reducing< reducing your max loss but it's also reducing your max loss but it's also good< good at saying that you know you've good at saying that you know you've given< given up on wanting to make money on given up on wanting to make money on this< this trade so whenever you roll into a this trade so whenever you roll into a butterfly< butterfly you pretty much have thrown butterfly you pretty much have thrown away< away most of your chances of actually away most of your chances of actually making< making money on the trade what you're making money on the trade what you're doing< doing is just saying you know I do not doing is just saying you know I do not want< want to lose a lot of money I don't mind want to lose a lot of money I don't mind not< not making money I just don't want to not making money I just don't want to lose< lose a lot and that's the time when you lose a lot and that's the time when you roll< roll to a butterfly so this would be the roll to a butterfly so this would be the last< last resort but as I said there's more last resort but as I said there's more than< than 21 days to expiration there's no than 21 days to expiration there's no real< real need or hurry for you to really real need or hurry for you to really roll< roll into a butterfly just here all roll into a butterfly just here all right< right scenario number six now the market right scenario number six now the market is< is still below the shot put strike and is still below the shot put strike and it< it has just reached 21 days to it has just reached 21 days to expiration< expiration so in this case it's a expiration so in this case it's a follow-up< follow-up from scenario five so follow-up from scenario five so basically< basically the market has gone past your basically the market has gone past your put< put strike but it never came up right it put strike but it never came up right it basically< basically just stayed somewhere around basically just stayed somewhere around out< out here so at this point of time you out here so at this point of time you definitely< definitely want to try and roll right definitely want to try and roll right that's< that's one thing you want to see whether that's one thing you want to see whether you< you can get a net credit for the you can get a net credit for the different< different kind of roles right so first different kind of roles right so first off< off you want to roll out the put side so off you want to roll out the put side so chances< chances are that this will most likely chances are that this will most likely be< be for a debit right it will be for a be for a debit right it will be for a debit debit debit so< so how are you gonna roll for a credit so how are you gonna roll for a credit to< to roll for a credit right now what you to roll for a credit right now what you want< want to do is to roll out and down your want to do is to roll out and down your short< short call spread so as I've mentioned short call spread so as I've mentioned earlier< earlier on you can just roll this down earlier on you can just roll this down so< so let's say if you try and roll it to so let's say if you try and roll it to the< the four one zero four one five now you the four one zero four one five now you want< want to see is this credit which you get want to see is this credit which you get down< down here all right this credit is it down here all right this credit is it going< going to be more than the debit over going to be more than the debit over here< here if you receive let's say 50 cents here if you receive let's say 50 cents for< for this Rule and you're rolling down for this Rule and you're rolling down here< here is for a negative 70 cents a debit here is for a negative 70 cents a debit 70< 70 cents then this is going to be a 70 cents then this is going to be a negative< negative row which is not what you want negative row which is not what you want right< right you're willing for net debit so right you're willing for net debit so what< what you want is that this has to be a what you want is that this has to be a much< much higher credit than what you're much higher credit than what you're rolling< rolling this debit for then it will make rolling this debit for then it will make sense< sense for you to roll so let's say if sense for you to roll so let's say if you< you roll to 410 you see that you know you roll to 410 you see that you know you< you cannot get a credit what you want to you cannot get a credit what you want to try< try and do next is to roll into a try and do next is to roll into a tighter< tighter iron Condor or a butterfly tighter iron Condor or a butterfly basically< basically you just try and see the other basically you just try and see the other strikes< strikes will it give you an overall net strikes will it give you an overall net credit< credit so you try the 400 and you try credit so you try the 400 and you try the< the 405 if this dude doesn't give your the 405 if this dude doesn't give your net< net credit then the last result is to go net credit then the last result is to go to< to a butterfly as I've mentioned in the to a butterfly as I've mentioned in the previous< previous scenario so if now you roll to previous scenario so if now you roll to a< a butterfly and you're able to get a net a butterfly and you're able to get a net credit< credit then yes you can consider rolling credit then yes you can consider rolling but< but what do you do when the market has but what do you do when the market has gone< gone so deep in the money and that no gone so deep in the money and that no matter< matter how you try and roll your iron matter how you try and roll your iron Condor< Condor you just cannot get a credit Condor you just cannot get a credit right< right so there are two things you can do right so there are two things you can do first< first of all of course you can just first of all of course you can just simply< simply close the trade out remember you simply close the trade out remember you do< do not have to win every single trade do not have to win every single trade there< there will be trades that you lose right there will be trades that you lose right in< in the long term you manage your risk in the long term you manage your risk well< well there is going to be a good chance well there is going to be a good chance you're< you're going to be profitable in the you're going to be profitable in the long< long run now the second option would be long run now the second option would be to< to hold on to this trade right you could to hold on to this trade right you could hold< hold on to the trade in hopes that the hold on to the trade in hopes that the market< market could come back you know a little market could come back you know a little bit< bit further up first and then you see bit further up first and then you see whether< whether you're able to roll for a credit whether you're able to roll for a credit right< right because there are some times where right because there are some times where the< the market will suddenly have a breather the market will suddenly have a breather maybe< maybe a rate traces up then if you are maybe a rate traces up then if you are not< not already assigned on your put option not already assigned on your put option right< right on the downside then you could try right on the downside then you could try and< and roll this down all right roll this and roll this down all right roll this call< call spread down and see whether this call spread down and see whether this time< time you're able to get a credit right time you're able to get a credit right but< but of course there's always a chance but of course there's always a chance that< that your shot put could get a sign if that your shot put could get a sign if your< your shot put gets assigned you will be your shot put gets assigned you will be long< long 100 shares this is where you know long 100 shares this is where you know you< you need to know how to unwind this you need to know how to unwind this position< position and I've already covered this position and I've already covered this in< in another video talked about uh shot in another video talked about uh shot put< put assignment so if you want to find put assignment so if you want to find out< out you know how to unwind your support out you know how to unwind your support assignment< assignment you can go and watch the assignment you can go and watch the video< video on my channel as well but if you video on my channel as well but if you don't< don't want to go through all this hassle don't want to go through all this hassle then< then the easiest way is to just close then the easiest way is to just close out< out your trades so these are the six out your trades so these are the six scenarios< scenarios I believe that I've covered scenarios I believe that I've covered most< most of the situations that you would be most of the situations that you would be in< in and this is when you may consider in and this is when you may consider rolling< rolling your iron Condor by the way if rolling your iron Condor by the way if you< you like this video then you're you like this video then you're absolutely< absolutely going to

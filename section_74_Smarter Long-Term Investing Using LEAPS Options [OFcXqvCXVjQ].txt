### Smarter Long-Term Investing Using LEAPS Options [OFcXqvCXVjQ]
=================================================================

Language: en all< all right alrighty So today we're going all right alrighty So today we're going to< to be talking about smarter long-term to be talking about smarter long-term investing< investing using leaps options now I've investing using leaps options now I've created< created a few other videos on leaps created a few other videos on leaps already< already but in this video I want to go already but in this video I want to go more< more in depth and give you a clearer more in depth and give you a clearer more< more well-rounded picture on what lips more well-rounded picture on what lips is< is and how you can use it as an is and how you can use it as an alternative< alternative uh to buying 100 shares alternative uh to buying 100 shares right< right to invest in the market all right right to invest in the market all right so< so first of all what are lips options so so first of all what are lips options so lips< lips is an acronym so basically stands lips is an acronym so basically stands for< for long-term Equity anticipation for long-term Equity anticipation Securities< Securities now I don't know why that Securities now I don't know why that they< they use this P when it's not a separate they use this P when it's not a separate word< word like the others right they just use word like the others right they just use p< p as part of this word instead of you p as part of this word instead of you know< know just calling it lias maybe the name know just calling it lias maybe the name doesn't< doesn't sound right lias so decided to doesn't sound right lias so decided to use< use lips to make it sound like something use lips to make it sound like something longterm< longterm right so the next thing about longterm right so the next thing about lips< lips when we want to use for long-term lips when we want to use for long-term investing< investing we want to ideally use the investing we want to ideally use the days< days to expiration of more than one year days to expiration of more than one year because< because if you're going to use it for a because if you're going to use it for a long< long term we definitely want to buy the long term we definitely want to buy the longest< longest available date that is for the longest available date that is for the uh< uh leaps and I'm going to give you a few uh leaps and I'm going to give you a few reasons< reasons why later on next when using reasons why later on next when using options< options as a stock replacement strategy options as a stock replacement strategy what< what we want to do is go for the deep in what we want to do is go for the deep in the< the money call options right we don't the money call options right we don't want< want to go for out of the money and we want to go for out of the money and we also< also don't want to go for the at the also don't want to go for the at the money< money we only want to go for the really money we only want to go for the really deep< deep in the money and that's because deep in the money and that's because deep< deep in the money calls have the closest deep in the money calls have the closest characteristics< characteristics to a stock right so if characteristics to a stock right so if we< we want to use uh lips as a replacement we want to use uh lips as a replacement for< for buying stocks we want to choose the for buying stocks we want to choose the right< right options right to have the the right options right to have the the closest< closest characteristics that simulates closest characteristics that simulates the< the stock as closely as possible that the stock as closely as possible that mimics< mimics the stock and you see the stock mimics the stock and you see the stock right< right when we buy stock or rather 100 right when we buy stock or rather 100 shares< shares of the stock it is 100% intrinsic shares of the stock it is 100% intrinsic value< value whereas when you buy options value whereas when you buy options there's< there's extrinsic value there's extrinsic value so< so in options the intrinsic value is the so in options the intrinsic value is the difference< difference between the stock price and difference between the stock price and the< the option strike price and it doesn't the option strike price and it doesn't Decay< Decay with time all right intrinsic Decay with time all right intrinsic value< value can be considered like the True value can be considered like the True Value< Value the true cost of the option and Value the true cost of the option and extrinsic< extrinsic value is time value and it extrinsic value is time value and it will< will Decay to zero at expiration so this will Decay to zero at expiration so this is< is what you call Theta Decay so that is is what you call Theta Decay so that is why< why the reason we want to go for deep in why the reason we want to go for deep in the< the money uh call option is because deep the money uh call option is because deep in< in the money call options right they in the money call options right they have< have high intrinsic value right the have high intrinsic value right the greater< greater the intrinsic value the deeper greater the intrinsic value the deeper the< the money is and the lesser the the money is and the lesser the extrinsic< extrinsic value so that is why our goal extrinsic value so that is why our goal is< is to have as much intrinsic value as is to have as much intrinsic value as possible< possible and to pay as little extrinsic possible and to pay as little extrinsic Val< Val value as possible now to give you an Val value as possible now to give you an analogy< analogy of uh the difference between analogy of uh the difference between intrinsic< intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value and extrinsic value right< right just imagine right uh if you were right just imagine right uh if you were to< to go to the manufacturer and let's say to go to the manufacturer and let's say you< you want to go ahead and buy a bag there you want to go ahead and buy a bag there right< right you'll find out that the cost of right you'll find out that the cost of maybe< maybe this bag right if you were to buy maybe this bag right if you were to buy at< at the manufacturer the true cost would at the manufacturer the true cost would be< be around $50 right maybe this is the be around $50 right maybe this is the cost< cost of uh the labor the raw materials cost of uh the labor the raw materials and< and basically the manufacturing of the and basically the manufacturing of the bag< bag it cost you $50 now if you were to bag it cost you $50 now if you were to buy< buy this same bag at the mall right it buy this same bag at the mall right it no< no longer cost you just $50 maybe this no longer cost you just $50 maybe this same< same bag would cost you something like same bag would cost you something like $80< $80 right and the reason is because they $80 right and the reason is because they have< have to mark up right to make profit and have to mark up right to make profit and they< they bring it to the convenience you they bring it to the convenience you know< know you don't have to go all the way to know you don't have to go all the way to the< the factory to get it instead you just the factory to get it instead you just go< go to the mall and the mall the the go to the mall and the mall the the shops< shops they have to pay rental for it shops they have to pay rental for it right< right so that is why there's the markup right so that is why there's the markup so< so in a sense we can say that the so in a sense we can say that the intrinsic< intrinsic value of this bag is actually intrinsic value of this bag is actually $50< $50 but then if you were to go buy the $50 but then if you were to go buy the back< back at the mall you have to pay a back at the mall you have to pay a markup< markup of $30 so this $30 can be seen as markup of $30 so this $30 can be seen as extrinsic< extrinsic value right so as much as extrinsic value right so as much as possible< possible right as smart investors we possible right as smart investors we want< want to buy our options rather our want to buy our options rather our options< options to have as much intrinsic value options to have as much intrinsic value as< as possible or rather to be as close as as possible or rather to be as close as to< to the intrinsic value as possible and to the intrinsic value as possible and not< not pay so much in terms of the markup not pay so much in terms of the markup so< so for lips option you have to so for lips option you have to understand< understand that this is nothing but a understand that this is nothing but a leverage< leverage tool to help you magnify your leverage tool to help you magnify your returns< returns but it can also be a returns but it can also be a double-edged< double-edged sword right if you do not double-edged sword right if you do not know< know what you're doing right it can know what you're doing right it can definitely< definitely give you higher returns definitely give you higher returns because< because you have lesser Capital At Risk because you have lesser Capital At Risk but< but on the downside you still have risk but on the downside you still have risk as< as well and it also magnify your losses as well and it also magnify your losses in< in terms of percentage wise because your in terms of percentage wise because your losses< losses will be upon the capital that you losses will be upon the capital that you put< put in right so I'll give you more uh uh put in right so I'll give you more uh uh explanation< explanation later on but ultimately the explanation later on but ultimately the key< key to success in leaps comes down to key to success in leaps comes down to the< the underlying stock selection and also the underlying stock selection and also the< the direction of where the stock is the direction of where the stock is headed< headed the moment you buy it right so headed the moment you buy it right so you< you you hear that sometimes you hear a you you hear that sometimes you hear a lot< lot of people say that you know they lot of people say that you know they lost< lost a lot of money buying leaps well lost a lot of money buying leaps well the< the thing is not necessarily that you the thing is not necessarily that you lost< lost money in leaps but rather you lost lost money in leaps but rather you lost because< because the underlying stock selection because the underlying stock selection that< that you chose just went to zero or just that you chose just went to zero or just went< went all the way down right because if went all the way down right because if you< you chose a stock that's going to go you chose a stock that's going to go down< down ultimately it doesn't matter down ultimately it doesn't matter whether< whether you're going to buy a leaps or whether you're going to buy a leaps or you're< you're going to buy stock right you're you're going to buy stock right you're still< still going to lose money so this is still going to lose money so this is very< very important to understand leps is very important to understand leps is just< just a tool on the underlying stock just a tool on the underlying stock right< right so if the underlying stock right so if the underlying stock selection< selection is no good if the stock goes selection is no good if the stock goes down< down immediately then you're going to down immediately then you're going to lose< lose regardless whether you buy shares lose regardless whether you buy shares or< or leaps when it comes to investing all or leaps when it comes to investing all right< right so here is the risk profile uh right so here is the risk profile uh comparing< comparing the 100 shares and the lips comparing the 100 shares and the lips option< option so if you will take a look on the option so if you will take a look on the left< left hand side this is for the stock we left hand side this is for the stock we will< will see uh three uh lines which I have will see uh three uh lines which I have uh< uh put up down here so we want to uh put up down here so we want to compare< compare the losses and the profits to compare the losses and the profits to each< each other to see how it goes right so each other to see how it goes right so this< this is the first point is at $50 so this is the first point is at $50 so it's< it's at $50 you see that it loses $6,000 it's at $50 you see that it loses $6,000 ,500< ,500 right for the strike of the 55 ,500 right for the strike of the 55 strike< strike for the deep in man call lips strike for the deep in man call lips option< option we actually lose less right we option we actually lose less right we lose lose lose $5,195< $5,195 and you notice that there are two $5,195 and you notice that there are two lines< lines down here there's this purple line lines down here there's this purple line and< and the blue line so the purple line is and the blue line so the purple line is basically< basically the amount that you stand to basically the amount that you stand to make< make all those today itself right based make all those today itself right based on< on today this is where the purple line on today this is where the purple line and< and over time this purple line will and over time this purple line will slowly< slowly start to conform to this blue slowly start to conform to this blue line< line basically it will go down to become line basically it will go down to become this< this blue line and the reason is because this blue line and the reason is because of< of extrinsic value extrinsic value will of extrinsic value extrinsic value will Decay< Decay over time right so first off right Decay over time right so first off right you< you notice that as the market drops you notice that as the market drops immediately< immediately you actually do not lose immediately you actually do not lose your< your max loss first right and if you your max loss first right and if you were< were to take a look at the max loss the were to take a look at the max loss the max< max loss is $6,279 max loss is $6,279 anywhere< anywhere from $55 all the way to zero anywhere from $55 all the way to zero that< that means you cannot lose more than that means you cannot lose more than that< that right for the the stock you see that right for the the stock you see from< from this point on you still can from this point on you still can continue< continue losing your money right that's continue losing your money right that's because< because the stock there's no cap to the because the stock there's no cap to the downside< downside in a sense you're going to lose downside in a sense you're going to lose your< your your Capital all the way down to your your Capital all the way down to the< the Zer where the stock goes to zero the Zer where the stock goes to zero whereas< whereas for leaps your loss is kept to whereas for leaps your loss is kept to how< how much you paid so in this case the how much you paid so in this case the max< max loss is max loss is $6,279< $6,279 butas for this if you paid $115 $6,279 butas for this if you paid $115 per< per share 100 shares you're going to per share 100 shares you're going to lose lose lose $11,500< $11,500 now let's take a look if the $11,500 now let's take a look if the stock< stock actually went up to $800 or $150 stock actually went up to $800 or $150 so< so at so at $150< $150 the stock makes $150 the stock makes $3,500< $3,500 whereas the lips only make $3,500 whereas the lips only make $3,326< $3,326 you can see it's actually not too $3,326 you can see it's actually not too much< much difference right you make slightly much difference right you make slightly lesser< lesser right but it's not that much lesser right but it's not that much difference< difference whereas on the downside you difference whereas on the downside you only< only lose about half of what you're only lose about half of what you're paying< paying for this right 100 shares you're paying for this right 100 shares you're going< going to pay 11,500 whereas for the lips going to pay 11,500 whereas for the lips option< option you pay 6,275 so that's slightly option you pay 6,275 so that's slightly more< more than half so that is why for the more than half so that is why for the leaps< leaps you have a cap downside where the leaps you have a cap downside where the loss< loss is really limited to about half loss is really limited to about half right< right if you want to choose up to half right if you want to choose up to half of< of what you pay for the 100 shares and of what you pay for the 100 shares and then< then on the upside you mimic very then on the upside you mimic very closely< closely to about 100% of the profits closely to about 100% of the profits that< that you make so this why the leaps can that you make so this why the leaps can be< be a very great tool to help you grow be a very great tool to help you grow your< your account okay now let's take a look your account okay now let's take a look if< if the stock price is at $100 so at $100 if the stock price is at $100 so at $100 you< you can see loses very little compared you can see loses very little compared to< to this all right this is about $1,500 to this all right this is about $1,500 whereas< whereas the lips lose whereas the lips lose $1,358< $1,358 so the whole idea down here the $1,358 so the whole idea down here the reason< reason why that you're not losing as reason why that you're not losing as much< much compared to when it's close to the much compared to when it's close to the expiration< expiration date is because extrinsic expiration date is because extrinsic value< value before it actually expires helps value before it actually expires helps you< you cushion your loss as it goes from in you cushion your loss as it goes from in the< the money to add the money right you the money to add the money right you notice< notice down here that the Gap is the notice down here that the Gap is the greatest< greatest down here right remember greatest down here right remember remember< remember your strike price is at 55 so remember your strike price is at 55 so at< at 55 is around here you notice your Gap at 55 is around here you notice your Gap is< is the biggest down here whereas when is the biggest down here whereas when it's< it's uh in the money down here and out it's uh in the money down here and out the< the money down here the Gap is the least the money down here the Gap is the least and< and the reason is because of how the and the reason is because of how the extrinsic< extrinsic uh value actually expands as extrinsic uh value actually expands as it< it goes to add the money so I'm going to it goes to add the money so I'm going to give< give you a graphical representation here give you a graphical representation here so< so let's say for example this is where so let's say for example this is where you< you bought the uh lips right so you'll you bought the uh lips right so you'll buy< buy the lips let's say we use example of buy the lips let's say we use example of 55< 55 so right now the stock right is at 55 so right now the stock right is at $100< $100 okay and then you bought the leaps $100 okay and then you bought the leaps of< of the 55 strike so at this point of of the 55 strike so at this point of time< time it is very deep in the money it's time it is very deep in the money it's considered< considered in the money so this is where considered in the money so this is where your< your extrinsic value lies right at this your extrinsic value lies right at this point< point now as the market goes up let's point now as the market goes up let's say< say the market goes to say the market goes to $110< $110 right let's say it goes to $110 right let's say it goes to $110< $110 your extr zic value starts to $110 your extr zic value starts to actually< actually decrease right because it actually decrease right because it becomes< becomes even more deeper in the money so becomes even more deeper in the money so in< in this case you gain intrinsic value in this case you gain intrinsic value but< but you lose extrinsic value right now but you lose extrinsic value right now let's< let's take a look about what what let's take a look about what what happens< happens on the other side now as your happens on the other side now as your strike< strike becomes at the money that means strike becomes at the money that means as< as this stock from $100 drops to your as this stock from $100 drops to your strike< strike price of $55 you notice that the strike price of $55 you notice that the extrinsic< extrinsic value actually gained right extrinsic value actually gained right while< while you lose in terms of your while you lose in terms of your intrinsic< intrinsic value from the stock uh drop intrinsic value from the stock uh drop in< in terms of the price you actually make in terms of the price you actually make money< money in in terms of your extrinsic money in in terms of your extrinsic value< value your extrinsic value gaining value value your extrinsic value gaining value to< to help you cushion the losses that you to help you cushion the losses that you made< made on the intrinsic value now as it made on the intrinsic value now as it goes< goes further down right if it drops goes further down right if it drops below< below $55 of course slowly your below $55 of course slowly your extrinsic< extrinsic value will start to drop as extrinsic value will start to drop as well< well so you can see this is the bell well so you can see this is the bell curve< curve right so as the market transitions curve right so as the market transitions from< from in the money to add the money you from in the money to add the money you make< make the most extrinsic value gain but make the most extrinsic value gain but as< as it drops even further until all the as it drops even further until all the money< money there's almost no value left right money there's almost no value left right the< the extrinsic value also basically the extrinsic value also basically almost< almost goes to zero as time passes as almost goes to zero as time. passes as well< well so what this means is that as the well so what this means is that as the market< market drops you actually have some market drops you actually have some protection< protection because your exens value protection because your exens value comes< comes in to help support you so I'm comes in to help support you so I'm going< going to show the option chain right going to show the option chain right here< here so you can uh really see if you can here so you can uh really see if you can see< see this option chain down here this is see this option chain down here this is the< the deep in money 55 strike you notice the deep in money 55 strike you notice the< the extrinsic value is the extrinsic value is $280< $280 right and as you get to the the $280 right and as you get to the the money< money of where the stock is right now money of where the stock is right now around< around $110 you notice that it becomes around $110 you notice that it becomes much< much thicker $17 $19 you can see this much thicker $17 $19 you can see this what< what this is a bell curve right you can what this is a bell curve right you can see< see that the extrinsic value becomes the see that the extrinsic value becomes the greatest< greatest at the money right and in the greatest at the money right and in the money< money and out the money has the least so money and out the money has the least so what< what happens like I mentioned before what happens like I mentioned before your< your extrinsic value will actually help your extrinsic value will actually help you< you cushion the losses as you lose money you cushion the losses as you lose money on< on the intrinsic value right okay on the intrinsic value right okay intrinsic< intrinsic value is just a difference intrinsic value is just a difference between< between the uh strike price and the between the uh strike price and the current< current price of the stock right so as current price of the stock right so as the< the stock goes down you lose intrinsic the stock goes down you lose intrinsic value< value but your extrinsic value will value but your extrinsic value will start< start to gain to help you cushion that start to gain to help you cushion that loss< loss so the role extrinsic value can be loss so the role extrinsic value can be actually< actually positive for you as you're actually positive for you as you're losing< losing money right but don't forget the losing money right but don't forget the extrinsic< extrinsic value will still Decay to zero extrinsic value will still Decay to zero over< over time now I want to show you the over time now I want to show you the graphical< graphical representation in terms of the graphical representation in terms of the value< value so you can understand a little bit value so you can understand a little bit better< better how this extrinsic value actually better how this extrinsic value actually comes< comes in to help you when the market is comes in to help you when the market is dropping< dropping all right when the stock you're dropping all right when the stock you're choosing< choosing is dropping so down here this choosing is dropping so down here this is< is the stock price right imagine the is the stock price right imagine the stock< stock went up and come down this stock went up and come down this retracement< retracement you said that all right I retracement you said that all right I want< want to go ahead and buy at this price want to go ahead and buy at this price all< all right so we will compare two things all right so we will compare two things we< we will compare 100 shares and we'll we will compare 100 shares and we'll compare< compare buying the deep in money call compare buying the deep in money call lips< lips all right so this is the strike lips all right so this is the strike price< price for the call lips right we buy price for the call lips right we buy deep< deep in the money it will always uh be deep in the money it will always uh be below< below whatever the value of the stock is below whatever the value of the stock is right< right now so let's say the stock value right now so let's say the stock value is< is at this price you can see this is the is at this price you can see this is the full< full intrinsic value so I've marked the full intrinsic value so I've marked the bar< bar to match the intrinsic value of bar to match the intrinsic value of where< where the stock is so let's say if the where the stock is so let's say if the stock< stock is at $100 then your intrinsic stock is at $100 then your intrinsic value< value of the stock is $100 now whereas value of the stock is $100 now whereas for< for the deep in the money cpse you for the deep in the money cpse you notice< notice that you're actually only going notice that you're actually only going to< to be paying uh up to where your strike to be paying uh up to where your strike is< is right so in so let's say for example is right so in so let's say for example if< if this is the 50 strike price or 55 if this is the 50 strike price or 55 strike< strike price you're only paying the strike price you're only paying the intrinsic< intrinsic value from where the current intrinsic value from where the current uh< uh stock price is to the callip strike uh stock price is to the callip strike price< price so you're only paying this much in price so you're only paying this much in terms< terms of intrinsic value and don't terms of intrinsic value and don't forget< forget we also have to have extrinsic forget we also have to have extrinsic value< value because you're paying for time value because you're paying for time value< value so this is the extrinsic value value so this is the extrinsic value portion< portion of the cyse all right so let's portion of the cyse all right so let's take< take a look of at how it uh actually take a look of at how it uh actually goes< goes when the uh stock goes up or down goes when the uh stock goes up or down so< so now let's say the stock goes down so now let's say the stock goes down right< right so Dro this much in terms of right so Dro this much in terms of intrinsic< intrinsic value so if you were to see intrinsic value so if you were to see I've< I've also colorcoded the bars to match I've also colorcoded the bars to match the< the intrinsic value loss so if the the intrinsic value loss so if the shares< shares or rather the stock drops by shares or rather the stock drops by let's< let's say $25 your stock intrinsic value let's say $25 your stock intrinsic value will< will drop by $25 your cpse intrinsic will drop by $25 your cpse intrinsic value< value will also drop by the same amount value will also drop by the same amount right< right it drops by the same amount by how right it drops by the same amount by how much< much the stock drops right that's much the stock drops right that's intrinsic< intrinsic value now what about the intrinsic value now what about the extrinsic< extrinsic value you notice that the extrinsic value you notice that the extrinsic< extrinsic value actually gained right extrinsic value actually gained right you< you see if you compare the one before you see if you compare the one before right< right intrinsic value drop but extrinsic right intrinsic value drop but extrinsic value< value actually gained so instead of value actually gained so instead of losing< losing this much right you are being losing this much right you are being actually< actually cushioned your loss has been actually cushioned your loss has been cushioned< cushioned by the gain by this uh part of cushioned by the gain by this uh part of the< the extrinsic value that gained in value the extrinsic value that gained in value okay< okay now what if the stock goes up now okay now what if the stock goes up now if< if the stock goes up right you can see if the stock goes up right you can see now< now this is the additional intrinsic now this is the additional intrinsic value< value gain so on your cyse you actually value gain so on your cyse you actually gain< gain the same amount in terms of in inic gain the same amount in terms of in inic value< value right but then your extrinsic value right but then your extrinsic value< value actually drops all right it value actually drops all right it decreases< decreases right you see before your decreases right you see before your extrinsic< extrinsic value is this amount but extrinsic value is this amount but because< because the stock went up although you because the stock went up although you gaining< gaining intrinsic value your extrinsic gaining intrinsic value your extrinsic value< value reduces a little bit so your your value reduces a little bit so your your gains< gains are a little bit muted a little gains are a little bit muted a little bit< bit decreased because this gains a bit decreased because this gains a little< little bit offset by the loss that you little bit offset by the loss that you made< made on the extrinsic value which is not made on the extrinsic value which is not much< much right so this is what happens when much right so this is what happens when the< the market Market goes up now what the market Market goes up now what happens< happens if the stock suddenly crash and happens if the stock suddenly crash and it< it crashes past your callip strike price it crashes past your callip strike price so< so this is what happens right so for the so this is what happens right so for the stock< stock intrinsic value is very stock intrinsic value is very straightforward< straightforward you lose straightforward you lose whatever< whatever uh intrinsic value from where whatever uh intrinsic value from where the< the current stri uh stock price is to the current stri uh stock price is to where< where you first bought it at right so where you first bought it at right so this< this is how much you lost right where this is how much you lost right where for< for the cpse you notice that you cannot for the cpse you notice that you cannot lose< lose all the way past here because you lose all the way past here because you only< only paid your intrinsic value up to only paid your intrinsic value up to this< this point so your intrinsic value you this point so your intrinsic value you already< already lost everything you only can already lost everything you only can lose< lose what you paid in terms of the lose what you paid in terms of the intrinsic< intrinsic value you cannot lose more intrinsic value you cannot lose more than< than that right so that's the beauty of than that right so that's the beauty of the< the cpse is because you also kept your the cpse is because you also kept your intrinsic< intrinsic value loss now on your other intrinsic value loss now on your other hand< hand right your extrinsic value actually hand right your extrinsic value actually gained< gained in value you notice it gained so gained in value you notice it gained so much< much in value to help you cushion the much in value to help you cushion the loss< loss of this intrinsic value again you loss of this intrinsic value again you see< see if you were to compare at where you see if you were to compare at where you first< first bought it you you see when we first bought it you you see when we first< first bought it your extrinsic value is first bought it your extrinsic value is this< this much your intrinsic value is this this much your intrinsic value is this much< much right but when the stock crash much right but when the stock crash below< below your strike Price look at this below your strike Price look at this your< your extrusive value has actually your extrusive value has actually expanded< expanded that much right to help you expanded that much right to help you cushion< cushion any losses here so you do not cushion any losses here so you do not have< have the full impact of the losses from have the full impact of the losses from this< this intrinsic value so again that is this intrinsic value so again that is why< why uh the the uh leaps the call leaps why uh the the uh leaps the call leaps the< the Mone colge has this protection uh the Mone colge has this protection uh against< against the stock crashing through the against the stock crashing through the form< form of your extrinsic value expanding form of your extrinsic value expanding whereas< whereas for stock there is no protection whereas for stock there is no protection whatsoever< whatsoever whatever you lose in terms of whatsoever whatever you lose in terms of the< the price is what you lose in your the price is what you lose in your stocks stocks stocks value< value all right now let's say for value all right now let's say for example< example the stock climbs back up to example the stock climbs back up to exactly< exactly where you bought it right where exactly where you bought it right where you< you bought the strike at uh where your you bought the strike at uh where your your< your stock is at right so the stock you your stock is at right so the stock you can< can see the intrinsic value goes back to can see the intrinsic value goes back to where< where it originally was so at this point where it originally was so at this point in< in time you do not make money you do not in time you do not make money you do not lose< lose money right but what about the Deep lose money right but what about the Deep the< the money cpse you notice that the deep the money cpse you notice that the deep in< in the money cpse right your intrinsic in the money cpse right your intrinsic value< value has been reinstated to the same value has been reinstated to the same amount< amount as when you first bought it but amount as when you first bought it but your< your extrinsic value actually decreased your extrinsic value actually decreased in< in value why that is because of time in value why that is because of time Theta< Theta Decay right you see at the Theta Decay right you see at the beginning< beginning when you first bought it your beginning when you first bought it your exic< exic value is this much but after some exic value is this much but after some time< time right the stock price goes back the time right the stock price goes back the same< same but now your option value your D same but now your option value your D Money< Money call is actually now worth less Money call is actually now worth less lesser< lesser than when you first bought it lesser than when you first bought it because< because of this uh extrinsic value so because of this uh extrinsic value so while< while extrinsic value actually helps you while extrinsic value actually helps you when< when the market is going down don't when the market is going down don't forget< forget that it is actually still forget that it is actually still decaying< decaying over time right it's slowly decaying over time right it's slowly slowly< slowly uh decaying and slowly picking up slowly uh decaying and slowly picking up speed< speed as lesser time is left in the speed as lesser time is left in the expiration< expiration of the option so that is why expiration of the option so that is why we< we need to really understand Theta Decay we need to really understand Theta Decay we< we need to understand how it works right we need to understand how it works right so< so this is the Theta Decay graph as you so this is the Theta Decay graph as you can< can see can see that< that the Theta Decay right is the least that the Theta Decay right is the least when< when there is a lot of time left in the when there is a lot of time left in the option< option right and you really starts to option right and you really starts to pick< pick up speed around the 45 days Mark pick up speed around the 45 days Mark right< right you notice that around the 45 days right you notice that around the 45 days Mark< Mark the curve SL starts to become much Mark the curve SL starts to become much steeper< steeper and it becomes even more steeper steeper and it becomes even more steeper as< as it goes to zero so as an analogy as it goes to zero so as an analogy right< right I like to compare this as though right I like to compare this as though that< that you're holding an ice cream right that you're holding an ice cream right you< you are eating ice cream and the ice you are eating ice cream and the ice cream< cream will melt over time right if you cream will melt over time right if you don't< don't eat it you just leave it there it don't eat it you just leave it there it will< will definitely melt because of the will definitely melt because of the weather< weather now there is a difference in weather now there is a difference in terms< terms of weather by the number of days terms of weather by the number of days left< left to exporation so the longer days left to exporation so the longer days there< there is left is like you're eating ice there is left is like you're eating ice cream< cream in Winter right does it melt of cream in Winter right does it melt of course< course it will melt but it melts very course it will melt but it melts very very< very slowly right it melts very slowly very slowly right it melts very slowly but< but as it gets closer to the expiration but as it gets closer to the expiration date< date right suddenly now you're no longer date right suddenly now you're no longer eating< eating your ice cream in the winter eating your ice cream in the winter you're< you're starting to eat it in the hot you're starting to eat it in the hot summer< summer so it as it gets closer and summer so it as it gets closer and closer< closer the temperature becomes hotter closer the temperature becomes hotter and< and hotter and that's where it starts to and hotter and that's where it starts to melt< melt very quickly so the Theta Decay is melt very quickly so the Theta Decay is not< not uniform right your extrinsic value not uniform right your extrinsic value does< does not Decay uniformly it's not the does not Decay uniformly it's not the same< same amount every day but rather it same amount every day but rather it starts< starts off very little and it starts to starts off very little and it starts to really< really pick up speeds towards the end of really pick up speeds towards the end of the< the expiration of the option so if you the expiration of the option so if you will< will take a look at the option chain you will take a look at the option chain you can< can see it very clearly down here right can see it very clearly down here right so< so if you take a look at the 537 days so if you take a look at the 537 days expiration< expiration down here you notice that the expiration down here you notice that the Theta< Theta Decay right this column down here Theta Decay right this column down here shows< shows that you're only losing 2 cents a shows that you're only losing 2 cents a day< day right you're only losing two cents a day right you're only losing two cents a day< day but as you get uh closer to the day but as you get uh closer to the expiration< expiration right you see this is 19 days expiration right you see this is 19 days left< left you notice that the uh Theta Decay left you notice that the uh Theta Decay becomes< becomes 9 cents right and here's the becomes 9 cents right and here's the interesting< interesting thing you see you notice interesting thing you see you notice that< that you actually have very little that you actually have very little extrinsic< extrinsic value left so by Logic if you extrinsic value left so by Logic if you have< have very little extrem value left have very little extrem value left compared< compared to if you have a lot of extrem compared to if you have a lot of extrem value< value left the Theta Decay should be value left the Theta Decay should be more< more here right but instead it's more here right but instead it's actually< actually more as it gets lesser and actually more as it gets lesser and again< again that is because of this graph down again that is because of this graph down here< here it really picks up speed only here it really picks up speed only closer< closer towards the expiration date so closer towards the expiration date so that< that is the reason why we always want to that is the reason why we always want to go< go for the furthest days to expiration go for the furthest days to expiration for< for the option because it gives us the for the option because it gives us the least< least Theta Decay right it gives us the least Theta Decay right it gives us the least< least Theta Decay this way we have much least Theta Decay this way we have much more< more time for the option to be right so more time for the option to be right so that< that the main reason why you want to go that the main reason why you want to go for< for a very long dated option right the for a very long dated option right the other< other reason is because when you buy the other reason is because when you buy the long-term< long-term uh expiration you notice you long-term uh expiration you notice you actually< actually uh have it cheaper right you actually uh have it cheaper right you buy< buy it cheaper it's almost like a buk buy it cheaper it's almost like a buk deal< deal right if you were to buy something deal right if you were to buy something right< right in bu it's always cheaper when it right in bu it's always cheaper when it comes< comes down to the cost right let's say comes down to the cost right let's say if< if you buy uh maybe a bottle of mineral if you buy uh maybe a bottle of mineral water< water cost you $1 but if you to buy 10 water cost you $1 but if you to buy 10 of< of them it may cost you $5 so the cost of them it may cost you $5 so the cost is< is 50 cents for one because you buy in B is 50 cents for one because you buy in B when< when we come to buying extrinsic value when we come to buying extrinsic value right< right it's the same right you notice right it's the same right you notice that< that it's actually much cheaper if you that it's actually much cheaper if you buy< buy and Bo so how do we know we can just buy and Bo so how do we know we can just calculate< calculate this okay let's just take a calculate this okay let's just take a look< look at the uh 10 strike price how much look at the uh 10 strike price how much do< do we pay per day for extrinsic value so do we pay per day for extrinsic value so we< we just take we just take 1705< 1705 all right which is extensive value 1705 all right which is extensive value we< we are paying for Here We divided by 19 we are paying for Here We divided by 19 days< days so we are paying roughly 8. 9 C so days so we are paying roughly 8.

9 C so let's< let's run it off that's 9 cents per day let's run it off that's 9 cents per day in< in terms. of extrinsic value but what in terms of extrinsic value but what about< about this so we take about this so we take $17 $17 $17. 105<.

105 same strike price and then we. 105 same strike price and then we divide< divide it by divide it by 537< 537 days look at that so we only paying 537 days look at that so we only paying three< three cents right whereas if you bought three cents right whereas if you bought the< the uh 19 days to expiration you're the uh 19 days to expiration you're paying< paying about 9 cents so that's three paying about 9 cents so that's three times< times small so that's also the reason times small so that's also the reason why< why we want to go for the longest dated why we want to go for the longest dated option< option because you get get it the option because you get get it the cheapest< cheapest in terms of uh per day the The cheapest in terms of uh per day the The Exchange< Exchange value which we paying per day Exchange value which we paying per day plus< plus your Theta Decay is the lowest so plus your Theta Decay is the lowest so that's< that's the reason why for long-term that's the reason why for long-term investing< investing we always want to go for the investing we always want to go for the longest< longest dated ones okay the next thing longest dated ones okay the next thing to< to understand is what to do when it's to understand is what to do when it's near< near expiration dat right when there's near expiration dat right when there's only< only left 60 to 90 days to expiration only left 60 to 90 days to expiration for< for your leaps option so this is where a for your leaps option so this is where a lot< lot of people get confused so what I lot of people get confused so what I want< want to do is I want to share with you want to do is I want to share with you what< what you can do when it's close to what you can do when it's close to expiration< expiration date so you know exactly what expiration date so you know exactly what to< to do without feeling confused right so to do without feeling confused right so first< first of all if your leaps option is in first of all if your leaps option is in a< a profit you can just simply close out a profit you can just simply close out to< to take the profit right and if you're to take the profit right and if you're still< still bullish you can reopen a new deep still bullish you can reopen a new deep in< in the money called lip so chances are in the money called lip so chances are that< that if you're in profit right your that if you're in profit right your let's< let's say you bought at a 90 Delta uh let's say you bought at a 90 Delta uh call< call liap option chances are you may call liap option chances are you may have< have gone up to maybe close to 100 right have gone up to maybe close to 100 right if< if it went if the stock really went all if it went if the stock really went all the< the way up right at this point of time the way up right at this point of time you< you can sell it off for a profit and you can sell it off for a profit and then< then you reinstate the 90 Deltas again then you reinstate the 90 Deltas again now< now but what if you are in a loss right now but what if you are in a loss right if< if you're in loss this is where the huge if you're in loss this is where the huge confusion< confusion comes which is where you want confusion comes which is where you want to< to really pay attention next so there to really pay attention next so there are< are three options that you can choose are three options that you can choose all< all right so the first option is that if all right so the first option is that if you're< you're no longer bullish on the stock you're no longer bullish on the stock all< all right then you just simply close for all right then you just simply close for a< a loss there's no point for you to roll a loss there's no point for you to roll to< to extend your losses right because when to extend your losses right because when you< you roll you have to add more Capital to you roll you have to add more Capital to it< it so you can always reinitiate another it so you can always reinitiate another deep< deep in money cpse when you're bullish deep in money cpse when you're bullish again< again right so if you're no longer again right so if you're no longer bullish< bullish just close it out for a loss bullish just close it out for a loss take< take the loss now option b if you're take the loss now option b if you're still< still bullish for the long term then you still bullish for the long term then you can< can actually just exercise the option at can actually just exercise the option at expiration< expiration right when you exercise it at expiration right when you exercise it at expiration< expiration basically you will just long expiration basically you will just long the< the 100 shares on the strike price now the 100 shares on the strike price now this< this is only if it's in the money so for this is only if it's in the money so for example< example you have a strike price of 55 example you have a strike price of 55 and< and let's say you initiated this liap and let's say you initiated this liap when< when the stock was at $100 and then uh when the stock was at $100 and then uh close< close to expiration or rather expiration close to expiration or rather expiration the< the stock is roughly around maybe let's the stock is roughly around maybe let's say< say $70 your strike is actually still in say $70 your strike is actually still in the< the money so what you could do you could the money so what you could do you could just< just leave it to uh exercise right if just leave it to uh exercise right if you< you leave it to expire the broker will you leave it to expire the broker will just< just exercise you when you're in the just exercise you when you're in the money< money and then you'll belong 100 shares money and then you'll belong 100 shares at< at $55 all right but this also means at $55 all right but this also means that< that to ensure that you actually have that to ensure that you actually have the< the capital to long in another 100 the capital to long in another 100 shares< shares at this point of time you just shares at this point of time you just have< have to hold on to it and wait for the have to hold on to it and wait for the stock< stock to go up again right now if you do stock to go up again right now if you do not< not want to convert it to stock right not want to convert it to stock right you< you want to have a more efficient way to you want to have a more. efficient way to use< use your Capital you can go for option C use your Capital you can go for option C and< and that is to roll this lips to extend and that is to roll this lips to extend the< the lips life right so when you're the lips life right so when you're rolling< rolling you're essentially just closing rolling you're essentially just closing it< it out take a loss and then you're it out take a loss and then you're initiating< initiating a new leaps again so when initiating a new leaps again so when you're< you're rolling this there are two you're rolling this there are two options< options you can take right you can options you can take right you can either< either roll to the same strike so let's either roll to the same strike so let's say< say you roll from the 55 strike to the say you roll from the 55 strike to the 55< 55 strike again 55 strike again but< but you go to the the furthest away days but you go to the the furthest away days to< to expiration this way you get to keep to expiration this way you get to keep the< the intrinsic value right because your the intrinsic value right because your intrinsic< intrinsic value will be still the same intrinsic value will be still the same as< as when you first paid for it but then as when you first paid for it but then you< you will have to pay additional you will have to pay additional extrinsic< extrinsic value and this is the most extrinsic value and this is the most extrinsic< extrinsic value because when the market extrinsic value because when the market or< or rather when the stock goes very close or rather when the stock goes very close to< to where your strike is remember we to where your strike is remember we talked< talked about this that as the market talked about this that as the market drops< drops closer to at the money which is drops closer to at the money which is where< where your strike price is your where your strike price is your extrinsic< extrinsic value becomes the highest so extrinsic value becomes the highest so when< when you're rolling at this this point when you're rolling at this this point you< you have to pay for the most extrinsic you have to pay for the most extrinsic value< value right on the other hand if you value right on the other hand if you don't< don't want to roll to the same strip you don't want to roll to the same strip you can< can roll to reestablish the same initial can roll to reestablish the same initial Delta< Delta so what this means is that you Delta so what this means is that you have< have to top up the intrinsic value that have to top up the intrinsic value that means< means also you have to pay for the means also you have to pay for the portion< portion of the intrinsic value which you portion of the intrinsic value which you did< did not pay for previously when you did not pay for previously when you first< first bought the lips right and then you first bought the lips right and then you just< just have to pay uh uh lesser extrinsic just have to pay uh uh lesser extrinsic value< value compared to if you roll to the value compared to if you roll to the same< same strike now this may some seem same strike now this may some seem confusing< confusing but bear with me I'm going to confusing but bear with me I'm going to show< show you in example here right so this show you in example here right so this is< is a real example so I actually have a is a real example so I actually have a lips< lips right now on the CRM which is lips right now on the CRM which is Salesforce< Salesforce you can see that the strike Salesforce you can see that the strike price< price which I bought for is price which I bought for is $15< $15 right and I paid $115 for it so I $15 right and I paid $115 for it so I paid< paid $11,500 for it and I bought this paid $11,500 for it and I bought this lips< lips when the stock was trading roughly lips when the stock was trading roughly uh< uh around $230 just slightly under uh around $230 just slightly under $230< $230 so that means I paid about 50% for $230 so that means I paid about 50% for it< it okay so you can see this is the it okay so you can see this is the current< current value right now it is $73 right current value right now it is $73 right so< so I I lost roughly like $42 on this so I I lost roughly like $42 on this right< right so there right so there $4,200< $4,200 this is the extrinsic value which $4,200 this is the extrinsic value which I< I have left and this is the the uh uh I have left and this is the the uh uh current< current Delta all right so at this point current Delta all right so at this point of< of time you ask yourself a question so of time you ask yourself a question so am< am I still bullish on Salesforce right am I still bullish on Salesforce right if< if the question if the answer is yes if the question if the answer is yes then< then this way I'll do a roll so there then this way I'll do a roll so there are< are two ways to roll as I mentioned are two ways to roll as I mentioned first< first you can roll to the same strike first you can roll to the same strike price< price so my strike price down here was price so my strike price down here was 115< 115 right so I will roll it to the same 115 right so I will roll it to the same strike< strike price at 115 you notice if I were strike price at 115 you notice if I were to< to roll it I only pay to roll it I only pay $98< $98 so it's $98 so it's $98< $98 right uh the reason is because I do $98 right uh the reason is because I do not< not really pay that much in terms of the not really pay that much in terms of the intrinsic< intrinsic value because I pretty much intrinsic value because I pretty much just< just kept the same intrinsic value as just kept the same intrinsic value as when< when I first initiated the lips the only when I first initiated the lips the only thing< thing I'm paying additional is this thing I'm paying additional is this extrinsic< extrinsic value so you notice now I'm extrinsic value so you notice now I'm paying< paying $13 in additional just to extend paying $13 in additional just to extend my< my leaps life say from the uh my leaps life say from the uh 173< 173 days by the way this 173 is how many 173 days by the way this 173 is how many days< days uh till expiration so about days uh till expiration so about extending< extending from 173 to 537 days so I'm extending from 173 to 537 days so I'm paying< paying $13.

11 for this extension in time paying $13. 11 for this extension in time right< right the strike price doesn't change so right the strike price doesn't change so when< when I pay in terms of this uh extensive when I pay in terms of this uh extensive value< value my break even also increases so value my break even also increases so this< this is very important to understand this is very important to understand right< right so previously right my break even right so previously right my break even is< is simply the strike Price Plus what I is simply the strike Price Plus what I paid< paid for it so that's paid for it so that's $230< $230 so that means if the stock goes up $230 so that means if the stock goes up to< to $230 by expiration I don't make money to $230 by expiration I don't make money I< I don't lose money but now because I I don't lose money but now because I have< have already extended this right let's have already extended this right let's say< say I've decided to roll to 115 I have say I've decided to roll to 115 I have to< to pay an additional $13 so what it to pay an additional $13 so what it means< means I have to addit means I have to addit on< on to my initial Break Even price and on to my initial Break Even price and this< this becomes my new Break Even price so this becomes my new Break Even price so my< my new Break Even price becomes my new Break Even price becomes $243< $243 and 11 cents it means by expiration $243 and 11 cents it means by expiration date< date the market has to go up the stock date the market has to go up the stock CRM< CRM has to go up to CRM has to go up to 24311< 24311 to break even anything above that 24311 to break even anything above that then< then is a profit at expiration so this then is a profit at expiration so this is< is what I'm paying additionally that I'm is what I'm paying additionally that I'm adding< adding on to my break even now if I were adding on to my break even now if I were to< to roll to the 80 strike instead what I to roll to the 80 strike instead what I mean< mean is that I'm trying to gain back the mean is that I'm trying to gain back the initial< initial Delta which is sold it for right initial Delta which is sold it for right sorry< sorry when I bought the lips for when I sorry when I bought the lips for when I first< first bought the lips Delta was roughly first bought the lips Delta was roughly around< around 95 Deltas so this is very close around 95 Deltas so this is very close to< to it so I'll be getting back the same to it so I'll be getting back the same Delta< Delta but then I have to pay much more Delta but then I have to pay much more you< you can see this time I have to pay $38 you can see this time I have to pay $38 so< so this is so this is $385< $385 so what does this consist basically $385 so what does this consist basically what< what I'm doing is I'm topping up the what I'm doing is I'm topping up the intrinsic< intrinsic value from 115 to 80 right I'm intrinsic value from 115 to 80 right I'm topping< topping up this intrinsic value which topping up this intrinsic value which I'm< I'm now going to have to on my I'm now going to have to on my pocket< pocket to pay it and then I'm only pocket to pay it and then I'm only paying paying paying $78< $78 compared to this $13 in terms of $78 compared to this $13 in terms of extrinsic< extrinsic value so that means my extrinsic value so that means my extrinsic< extrinsic value which I have to pay is extrinsic value which I have to pay is lesser< lesser by about half almost half right lesser by about half almost half right so< so what is my break even for this so my so what is my break even for this so my break< break even will be now 230 right plus break even will be now 230 right plus the< the $7 right the $7 right $78< $78 so what is the uh break even now the $78 so what is the uh break even now the break< break even now will be about break even now will be about $237< $237 so $237 is definitely much easier $237 so $237 is definitely much easier to< to reach than to reach than $243< $243 but I have to pay more for it but $243 but I have to pay more for it but I'm< I'm paying in terms of intrinsic value I'm paying in terms of intrinsic value so< so if it comes to me if it was me I so if it comes to me if it was me I definitely< definitely would want to roll it to this definitely would want to roll it to this because< because I will keep most of it in because I will keep most of it in intrinsic< intrinsic value because in my mind I intrinsic value because in my mind I would< would have already bought 100 shares of would have already bought 100 shares of CRM< CRM at the start right that's all CRM at the start right that's all intrinsic< intrinsic value so rather than pay more intrinsic value so rather than pay more extrinsic< extrinsic value why would I want to pay extrinsic value why would I want to pay the< the mark up right when I can just top up the mark up right when I can just top up the< the intrinsic value and I pay lesser the intrinsic value and I pay lesser extrinsic< extrinsic value this way it's easier for extrinsic value this way it's easier for my< my uh option to make money as the stock my uh option to make money as the stock goes< goes up right so the other thing to take goes up right so the other thing to take note< note of is this Delta note of is this Delta you< you see at this point of time it's 92 you see at this point of time it's 92 Deltas< Deltas if I was to roll to the 115 Deltas if I was to roll to the 115 suddenly< suddenly the Delta becomes 87 so what suddenly the Delta becomes 87 so what this< this means is that as as the market this means is that as as the market actually< actually went down right from the point actually went down right from the point in< in time when I bought first bought the in time when I bought first bought the options< options I actually uh lost 92 Deltas on options I actually uh lost 92 Deltas on the< the way down right I would lose like 95 the way down right I would lose like 95 Deltas< Deltas 94 delt 93 deltas and if you Deltas 94 delt 93 deltas and if you really< really remember what Delta is basically really remember what Delta is basically it< it is the value of the option whether it it is the value of the option whether it increases< increases or decreases based on the increases or decreases based on the dollar< dollar movement of the stock price so dollar movement of the stock price so every< every dollar that the market is uh going every dollar that the market is uh going down< down the CRM is going down I'm losing uh down the CRM is going down I'm losing uh 92< 92 cents or 92 cents or $92< $92 uh in terms of 100 shares right so $92 uh in terms of 100 shares right so this< this is very important to understand this is very important to understand because< because if I were to lose $92 or 92 because if I were to lose $92 or 92 Deltas< Deltas on the way down if I was to Deltas on the way down if I was to reinstate< reinstate this I only make 87 Deltas on reinstate this I only make 87 Deltas on the< the way up so that doesn't make sense the way up so that doesn't make sense because< because I'm losing more on the way down because I'm losing more on the way down and< and then it go on the way up I actually and then it go on the way up I actually make< make lesser so this means it has to go make lesser so this means it has to go up< up more in order for me to make back the up more in order for me to make back the loss< loss which I had on the way down so loss which I had on the way down so rather< rather than do this I want to reinstate rather than do this I want to reinstate a< a higher Delta so this way when it goes a higher Delta so this way when it goes when< when when the market goes up starting when when the market goes up starting from< from 94 Deltas right I will make more on from 94 Deltas right I will make more on the< the way up than it is on the way down so the way up than it is on the way down so this< this means that the market doesn't have this means that the market doesn't have to< to go up that much in order for me to to go up that much in order for me to make< make back the loss which I had here make back the loss which I had here right< right so if the market comes down this right so if the market comes down this much< much let's say based on uh 92 Deltas all much let's say based on uh 92 Deltas all right< right if the market was to just go up right if the market was to just go up somewhere< somewhere down here it doesn't have to somewhere down here it doesn't have to fully< fully go up down here based on the 94 fully go up down here based on the 94 Delta< Delta because this don't forget this is Delta because this don't forget this is dynamic< dynamic Delta the Delta will increase as dynamic Delta the Delta will increase as it< it goes up it means once the market it goes up it means once the market reaches< reaches this point I would have pretty reaches this point I would have pretty much< much already made back what I lost at much already made back what I lost at this< this point in time all right so this is this point in time all right so this is important< important to understand when it comes to important to understand when it comes to Rolling< Rolling okay so let's take a look at Rolling okay so let's take a look at some< some pros and cons of owning stock some pros and cons of owning stock versus< versus is are buying deep in the money versus is are buying deep in the money call< call lips so the pros for the stocks is call lips so the pros for the stocks is that< that there's no expiration so this is that there's no expiration so this is very< very straightforward and easy understand very straightforward and easy understand because< because this way you don't have to worry because this way you don't have to worry about< about you know the option expiring about you know the option expiring because< because there's no expiration date so because there's no expiration date so you< you do not have to worry about how to you do not have to worry about how to roll< roll or when to roll right I like deep roll or when to roll right I like deep in< in the money call deeps you do have to in the money call deeps you do have to uh< uh worry about rolling and know how to uh worry about rolling and know how to roll< roll when it gets closer to expiration roll when it gets closer to expiration date< date now for stocks it's 100% intrinsic date now for stocks it's 100% intrinsic value< value and there's no extrinsic value so value and there's no extrinsic value so you< you do not have to worry about uh Theta you do not have to worry about uh Theta decay< decay in this sense and for stocks you decay in this sense and for stocks you can< can receive dividends now whereas for can receive dividends now whereas for deep< deep in the money call lips you have deep in the money call lips you have limited< limited downside and because of this limited downside and because of this right< right you have lesser Capital At Risk right you have lesser Capital At Risk because< because you can put up you know as because you can put up you know as little< little as 50% of the uh cost you will little as 50% of the uh cost you will put< put up for 100 shares or you could go put up for 100 shares or you could go slightly< slightly even lesser if you want to have slightly even lesser if you want to have a< a lesser Delta but basically you will a lesser Delta but basically you will have< have much lesser Capital At Risk have much lesser Capital At Risk compared< compared to stocks because stocks you compared to stocks because stocks you have< have to pay the full value of 100 shares have to pay the full value of 100 shares Now< Now with uh de and money cpse you also Now with uh de and money cpse you also have< have higher returns because your returns have higher returns because your returns if< if you as you have already seen in the if you as you have already seen in the p&amp;l< p&amp;l graph uh the profits is actually p&amp;l graph uh the profits is actually very< very similar to stocks now the very similar to stocks now the difference< difference is that we have lesser difference is that we have lesser Capital< Capital At Risk so if we were to divided Capital At Risk so if we were to divided by< by the amount of capital which we have by the amount of capital which we have which< which we put out for the cpse our return which we put out for the cpse our return is< is actually higher in terms of is actually higher in terms of percentage< percentage and there's also Dynamic percentage and there's also Dynamic Delta< Delta right so we've seen that d uh Delta right so we've seen that d uh Dynamic< Dynamic Delta means the Delta moves as Dynamic Delta means the Delta moves as the< the stock moves so if the stock drops the stock moves so if the stock drops the< the Delta will actually drop as well the Delta will actually drop as well which< which means you start to lose lesser as which means you start to lose lesser as the< the stock drops but on the way up the the stock drops but on the way up the Delta< Delta actually increases so this way you Delta actually increases so this way you make< make more as the stock goes up so make more as the stock goes up so extrinsic< extrinsic value in the deep in money extrinsic value in the deep in money call< call lifs actually also help to cushion call lifs actually also help to cushion losses< losses as stock drops right so as we losses as stock drops right so as we already< already seen there's this bell curve already seen there's this bell curve right< right so this bell curve we always start right so this bell curve we always start off< off with the in the money over here off with the in the money over here right< right so we are buying the deep in the right so we are buying the deep in the money< money called so this is the value of our money called so this is the value of our uh< uh extrinsic value which we have uh extrinsic value which we have purchased< purchased now if the stock is to drop purchased now if the stock is to drop our< our in the money will start to shift to our in the money will start to shift to add< add the money so at the money this is add the money so at the money this is where< where the extrinsic value is at its where the extrinsic value is at its highest< highest so that is why we are able to highest so that is why we are able to cushion< cushion some of the losses because cushion some of the losses because although< although the intrinsic value we have although the intrinsic value we have lost< lost we have actually gained in our lost we have actually gained in our extrinsic< extrinsic value and that helps offset extrinsic value and that helps offset any< any losses in the intrinsic value all any losses in the intrinsic value all right< right let's take a look at our cons now right let's take a look at our cons now for< for the stocks we have more Capital At for the stocks we have more Capital At Risk< Risk. because as I mentioned we have to Risk because as I mentioned we have to pay< pay up a full you know the full cost for pay up a full you know the full cost for 100< 100 of shares and because of that we 100 of shares and because of that we have< have lower returns and there's no have lower returns and there's no extrinsic< extrinsic value to cushion the loss so extrinsic value to cushion the loss so in< in a sense there's no protection to the in a sense there's no protection to the downside< downside in the form of extrinsic value downside in the form of extrinsic value for< for stocks right now for deep in the for stocks right now for deep in the money< money calls although extrinsic value money calls although extrinsic value helps< helps to cushion the losses as it drops helps to cushion the losses as it drops you< you must remember that there's also the you must remember that there's also the Theta< Theta Decay that means as it get close Theta Decay that means as it get close to< to the expiration datee you know it will to the expiration datee you know it will start< start to lose its value and ultimately start to lose its value and ultimately become< become come zero at expiration so you become come zero at expiration so you must< must always keep this in mind so when it must always keep this in mind so when it gets< gets closer to the expiration date this gets closer to the expiration date this is< is where you will need to roll and when is where you will need to roll and when you< you roll you will need to add Capital to you roll you will need to add Capital to extend< extend the leap's life right you're extend the leap's life right you're adding< adding Capital that also means that adding Capital that also means that you're< you're increasing the risk the overall you're increasing the risk the overall risk< risk to the C lips right so let's say risk to the C lips right so let's say for< for example if you bought the cpse let's for example if you bought the cpse let's say< say you bought it for $10 so $10 would say you bought it for $10 so $10 would be< be $11,000 now if it's get it's getting be $11,000 now if it's get it's getting close< close to the expiration date right you close to the expiration date right you want< want to roll it so as you roll it you want to roll it so as you roll it you might< might need to top up maybe another $2 might need to top up maybe another $2 for< for it right so if you were to top up $2 for it right so if you were to top up $2 now< now your total risk on this uh callip now your total risk on this uh callip would< would be $12 which means if the stock would be $12 which means if the stock let's< let's say touch with does go to zero you let's say touch with does go to zero you lose< lose an additional $2 on top of the $10 lose an additional $2 on top of the $10 which< which youve already put in so this is which youve already put in so this is something< something to keep in mind when you're something to keep in mind when you're getting< getting into or when you're buying de getting into or when you're buying de and< and money call deps and finally you know and money call deps and finally you know there< there are no dividend for options right there are no dividend for options right so< so that is why it's always better to use so that is why it's always better to use on< on non-dividend stocks so I would rather on non-dividend stocks so I would rather use< use this on like uh tech stocks because use this on like uh tech stocks because they< they do not really pay any dividends or they do not really pay any dividends or if< if they do they pay very little so this if they do they pay very little so this way< way right you do not lose out on any way right you do not lose out on any dividends< dividends because they don't pay out any dividends because they don't pay out any dividends< dividends in the first place all right dividends in the first place all right so< so let's have some final takeaways so so let's have some final takeaways so the< the very first takeaway is that deep in the very first takeaway is that deep in the< the money cpse is a great replacement the money cpse is a great replacement tool< tool or it's a great replacement tool or it's a great replacement strategy< strategy uh for buying stock right strategy uh for buying stock right because< because you have lesser Capital At Risk because you have lesser Capital At Risk which< which is very important compared to which is very important compared to stocks< stocks and you have the same unlimited stocks and you have the same unlimited upside< upside as stocks right so if stocks go upside as stocks right so if stocks go all< all the way to the Moon right your lips all the way to the Moon right your lips can< can also the value can also go to the can also the value can also go to the Moon< Moon as well so thus you have a greater Moon as well so thus you have a greater return< return compared to stocks now deep in return compared to stocks now deep in the< the money call lips have intrinsic value the money call lips have intrinsic value and< and extrinsic value so intrinsic value and extrinsic value so intrinsic value is< is considered the true value of the is considered the true value of the option< option whereas extrinsic value is option whereas extrinsic value is considered< considered the markup we have to pay and considered the markup we have to pay and if< if you recall we have this uh example if you recall we have this uh example where< where I talked about the bag right so if where I talked about the bag right so if you< you were to go to the manufacturer of you were to go to the manufacturer of the< the bag maybe you would probably only the bag maybe you would probably only pay< pay $50 that's the true cost of this bag pay $50 that's the true cost of this bag but< but if you were to purchase the same bag but if you were to purchase the same bag at< at the mall right you would have to pay at the mall right you would have to pay a< a premium right maybe the bag they a premium right maybe the bag they charge< charge you $80 instead of $50 right so charge you $80 instead of $50 right so you're< you're paying an additional $30 in terms you're paying an additional $30 in terms of< of Premium right so premium in terms of of Premium right so premium in terms of extrinsic< extrinsic value so when we are buying extrinsic value so when we are buying options< options we always want to buy as much options we always want to buy as much intrinsic< intrinsic value as possible or rather as intrinsic value as possible or rather as close< close close to the intrinsic value as close close to the intrinsic value as possible< possible and we want to pay as little possible and we want to pay as little extrinsic< extrinsic value as possible because extrinsic value as possible because ultimately< ultimately we already know extrinsic ultimately we already know extrinsic value< value goes to zero so next extrinsic value goes to zero so next extrinsic value< value helps cushion any loss of value helps cushion any loss of intrinsic< intrinsic value as the deep in the money intrinsic value as the deep in the money call< call lips goes from in the money to add call lips goes from in the money to add the< the money again this is the bell curve the money again this is the bell curve which< which I mentioned earlier but it also which I mentioned earlier but it also ultimately< ultimately decays to zero at expiration ultimately decays to zero at expiration so< so we are having we we need to balance so we are having we we need to balance both< both of them right we know that it helps both of them right we know that it helps cushion< cushion but at the same time as it gets cushion but at the same time as it gets closer< closer the the value of this cushion can closer the the value of this cushion can still< still start to drop down to zero hence still start to drop down to zero hence we< we always want to buy the furthest dated we always want to buy the furthest dated expiration< expiration because when we do that we expiration because when we do that we are< are sort of buying extrinsic value in are sort of buying extrinsic value in buk< buk when we are buying in buk we buk when we are buying in buk we actually< actually pay lesser per day in extrinsic actually pay lesser per day in extrinsic value< value and that also gives us the slowest value and that also gives us the slowest Theta< Theta Decay because if you remember the Theta Decay because if you remember the Theta< Theta curve they do not Decay at the Theta curve they do not Decay at the same< same rate the the the Decay starts to same rate the the the Decay starts to pick< pick up right this slope starts to pick up right this slope starts to become< become steeper as it gets closer towards become steeper as it gets closer towards the< the expiration day so if you recall I the expiration day so if you recall I used< used the analogy using the ice cream and used the analogy using the ice cream and this< this being winter on this side where this being winter on this side where it's< it's very cold winter and this is Summer it's very cold winter and this is Summer right< right so as much as possible we want to right so as much as possible we want to get< get our options the deep and money call get our options the deep and money call lips< lips towards this side of the uh Theta lips towards this side of the uh Theta Decay< Decay curve which is the furthest Decay curve which is the furthest expiration< expiration date that we can buy next expiration date that we can buy next when< when it's close to expiration date when it's close to expiration date roughly< roughly around DTE 1690 right we can roughly around DTE 1690 right we can either< either if it's in a profit close close either if it's in a profit close close for< for profit and we are still bullish just for profit and we are still bullish just reinitiate< reinitiate another deep in the money reinitiate another deep in the money called< called this position so this is also called this position so this is also another< another role but in this case we another role but in this case we actually< actually do not have to top up money actually do not have to top up money when< when you are in profit and you want to when you are in profit and you want to roll< roll it you're actually taking profit on roll it you're actually taking profit on it< it right so this the difference between it right so this the difference between uh< uh rolling for a loss and rolling in a uh rolling for a loss and rolling in a in< in a profit right so if you're in a loss in a profit right so if you're in a loss you< you have three options as we've you have three options as we've mentioned< mentioned so the first thing is to close mentioned so the first thing is to close for< for a loss if you're no longer bullish for a loss if you're no longer bullish right< right then you can wait until you know right then you can wait until you know the< the stock gives you you a good signal the stock gives you you a good signal where< where you feel it's it's going to go up where you feel it's it's going to go up again< again then you can re-enter into another again then you can re-enter into another deep< deep Inon cpse now option b is that if deep Inon cpse now option b is that if you< you are still bullish right you can you are still bullish right you can choose< choose to exercise the option to Long choose to exercise the option to Long 100< 100 shes right basically you only want 100 shes right basically you only want to< to exercise it at the end of the to exercise it at the end of the expiration< expiration right you don't want to ex uh expiration right you don't want to ex uh exercise< exercise it when there's still some time exercise it when there's still some time value< value left because if you would exercise value left because if you would exercise it< it when there's still time value left it when there's still time value left where< where there's still extrusive value then where there's still extrusive value then you< you for goinging any extrinsic value so you for goinging any extrinsic value so this< this exercise option is basically only this exercise option is basically only if< if your option is still in the money at if your option is still in the money at expiration< expiration then you can choose to expiration then you can choose to exercise< exercise it and then you just top up the exercise it and then you just top up the remaining< remaining amount which you need to buy remaining amount which you need to buy the< the 100 shares if you do not want to do the 100 shares if you do not want to do that< that the other alternative is to roll that the other alternative is to roll right< right so you want to roll to the right so you want to roll to the furthest< furthest days to expiration so either at furthest days to expiration so either at the< the same strike right this way you the same strike right this way you maintain< maintain the same intrinsic value but maintain the same intrinsic value but you< you have to pay much more in terms of you have to pay much more in terms of exic< exic value or you can just reinstate the exic value or you can just reinstate the previous< previous Delta so in this case you have previous Delta so in this case you have to< to top up more uh Capital because you're to top up more uh Capital because you're actually< actually topping up in terms of actually topping up in terms of intrinsic< intrinsic value more and then you're intrinsic value more and then you're paying< paying slightly lesser right you're paying slightly lesser right you're paying< paying lesser extrinsic value compared paying lesser extrinsic value compared to< to uh if you were to just roll to the to uh if you were to just roll to the same< same strip now finally and ultimately same strip now finally and ultimately the< the success of your call lips as a stock the success of your call lips as a stock replacement< replacement strategy still comes down to replacement strategy still comes down to whether< whether the underlying stock goes up or whether the underlying stock goes up or not< not right so you have to understand that not right so you have to understand that if< if the lips lose money it's not because if the lips lose money it's not because lips< lips is not a good tool but rather lips is not a good tool but rather because< because you have chosen the wrong stock because you have chosen the wrong stock or< or when you bought it the stock starts or when you bought it the stock starts going< going down right so the direction has to going down right so the direction has to go< go up in the long term so ultimately it go up in the long term so ultimately it is< is just a tool to help you enhance your is just a tool to help you enhance your profit< profit and reduce your risk but it profit and reduce your risk but it doesn't< doesn't prevent you from losing money at doesn't prevent you from losing money at all< all that ultimately comes down to uh all that ultimately comes down to uh choosing< choosing the right stock all right guys choosing the right stock all right guys I< I hope this video has been helpful for I hope this video has been helpful for you< you you and if it has I'd appreciate if you you and if it has I'd
